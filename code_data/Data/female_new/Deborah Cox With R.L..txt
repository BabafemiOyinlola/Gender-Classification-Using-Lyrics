When you're in love Somethings you take for granted Until someone pulls it apart And leaves you with half of your heart  How do I trade The best I have for less Without giving up Should I slowly accept When will be no more than just friends  How do I know when to let go I know what I'm feeling inside But part of me still wants to try So tell me  Where do we go from here?

When you're in love Somethings you take for granted Until someone pulls it apart And leaves you with half of your heart  How do I trade The best I have for less Without giving up Should I slowly accept When will be no more than just friends  How do I know when to let go I know what I'm feeling inside But part of me still wants to try So tell me  Where do we go from here? Why's my heart filled With so much fear? When all that you are Is all I need and more  There's no winning this The battles just begun I know it's over, but I still feel the same ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Friends tell me I am crazy That I'm wasting time with you You'll never be mine That's not the way I see it 'Cause I feel you're already mine Whenever you're with me  People always talk about, reputation I don't care what you do to them Just be good to me Friends are always tellin' me you're a user I don't care 'bout your other girls Just be good to me  You may have many others But I know when you're with me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

Nobody's supposed to be here I've tried that love thing for the last time My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here But you came along and changed my mind  I've spent all my life on a search to find The love who'll stay for eternity The heaven sent to fulfill my needs But when I turn around Again love has knocked me down My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad I'm sad to say, “Love wins again”  So I placed my heart under lock and key To take some time and take care of me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
It was a cold day in December I remember it so well You captured my whole being And you left me in a spell You warmed my heart with passion Desiring all of you You left me cold in the summer I wish that I had only knew, but I  I never knew that you would be the one To come along and snatch my heart and run Away from me with no explanation why I never knew what we had would die All I wanna do is hide away From all the hurt and pain of yesterday Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside I never knew, please tell me why, why  All the nights you left me crying Keeping company with my fears ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

Heartfelt conversations we had every single night, lying in bed together, So why would there ever be a breakdown in communication, And I'm just wondering was that the warm and fuzzy feeling  Those good old days seem like so long ago I thought you cared about me then, but now I don't know Was there ever really love at all in your heart Was there ever really love at all Did you ever love me  I wanna go back, way back to the beginning when we could rely on each other ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
