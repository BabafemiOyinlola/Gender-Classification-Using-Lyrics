When two people meet it doesn't take them long to discover If the feelings good they know their bodies their for each other Someday you'll find a genuine affection Two tender hearts heading in the same direction When passion grows it's like a river flowing Where it really leads there is no way of knowing  Where does it begin the story of a man and a woman I wonder Is it with a kiss or is it with a fuss we talk Ah tell me Where does it begin the story of a man and a woman It starts with such a little hoping it becomes so much  How can I explain it's such a simple game when you work it out A woman and a man tryna understand what it's all about Yeah ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Shh... I hear the static drawing nearer. There's no way out. I breathe the ice and let the fire die. They keep on feeling me the chemicals I need to breathe. But how could something so important not belong to me? I can't pretend like I'm the one who's going to change this. But all I know is that our time is running out. I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go.  So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness. I make mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks. I've seen such hate surround the inside of this dark abyss. But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find a brighter paths. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
