Yeah, Yeah sing it with me y'all,  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Can we wait just a minute? Slow it down for a minute now, baby You're talkin' loud, you're wilding out Don't seem like my old lady Let's go and play the song we used to play Can we reignite the flame? 'Cause things just ain't the same  We can talk about the baby We can talk until we're crazy We can focus on it now Or we can focus on it later We can start another fight We can argue and fuss all night But I propose that we go  To floor and we slow dance Tonight I wanna dance ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Another Again"  So we did it again Knowing we should quit it, but we simply won't admit it again Oh it feels good, it's so good, but I won't do it again It's so dramatic again After we go at it, we get mad then we go at it again Oh I love it, then I hate it, she's my favorite again I'm wasting time I can't help it she's so fine Oh I like her style And I love the way she talks and I smile As much as we may try Can't quite see eye to eye So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye  (And again and again and again) Oh, and then, we do it again We do it again and we do it again ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused She may not be you But she looks just like you She may not be you But she looks just like you  You should've seen the way she wore her dress And her white stiletto shoes You should've seen the way they looked on her Just like the ones that I bought you I searched for days on end to no avail 'Til I found them in Peru She must've been to Lima just as well Because she had them too You should've seen her eyes, her lips, her face She looked as sweet as honeydew ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

A father waits upon a son A mother prays for his return I just called to see If you still have a place for me We know that like took us apart But you're still within my heart I go to sleep and feel your spirit next to me  I'll make it home again I pray you'll fall in love again Just say you'll entertain the possibility I learned enough from my mistakes Learned from all I didn't say Won't you wait for me  It may be long to get me there It feels like I've been everywhere But someday I'll be coming home ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Remember when, I caught your eye, You gave me rainbows, and butterflies, We did enjoy, a happiness, When our love was over, I was such a mess, I smiled at you, and you smiled back, That's when I knew, there's no turning back, You said you loved me, and I did too, Although it's over, I still love you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Here we are, under the stars Here we are, under the stars Heaven is not so far Heaven is not so far Heaven is not so far Under the stars  We'll find a love to hold our hand through the cold We'll find an angel light out in the storm We'll see a light to lead us all the way home And wherever we go we will know  Here we are, under the stars Here we are, under the stars Heaven is not so far ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
You bought your smile in a corner You paid a pretty little penny, you did.  You paint yourself in a picture As you deny the kind of person you've been You get what you feel, what you wish to be You can't live sarcastic sincerity You sharpen your guilt like a guillotine  You get what you feel, you get what you feel I gave you everything, you threw it away. Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette. Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Holla Holla Holla Holla Holla Holla  Maybe, it's me, maybe I bore you But no no, it's my fault,'cause I can't afford you Maybe baby, Puffy, Jay-z would all be better for you 'Cause all I can do is love you  Baby when I used to love you There's nothing that I wouldn't do I went through the fire for you, do anything you asked me to But I tired of livin this lie It's getting harder to justify Realized that I just don't love you Not like I used to  Holla Holla Holla Holla Holla Holla  Maybe, I should rob somebody So we could, live like Whitney and Bobby It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss But you are, above cost 'Cause all I could do was love you  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
