These days I don't watch the news 'Cause it's always pain One-sided stories told Keeping minds in chains  Dividing, conquering while corporations gain And politician's lies how our freedom fades But if we got to be the solitary light in the dark, then I will And if we got to be the only ones Sharing our hearts, then I will  We keep on holding things together While they pull them apart But I will  Spread love to my very last day on this earth And I will, I will  Spread love, spread love, spread love I will, I will, I will Spread love, spread love, spread love I will, I will, I will  In times like these people just wanna fly They just want a reason 'cause they just wanna smile They just want a leader But they don't want the lies They want freedom to live Because they don't wanna die We're searching for guidance So we look to the sky ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
The devil wants me to sin Every evil thought and action pays him And go against the families that were raised in. Sell our souls at the crossroads And live by the crossbones and only praise him   I ain't religious, I'm the Prince of the sinners ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
[Talking:] Yo, shit, I told yo ass when you was over from that side of the menu, That was the fuckin' side. Now you act like you don't wanna give up them draws? Check this shit out loc, I make you a lil deal. You gonna give up them draws and I won't get in that ass, know what I'm sayin?  [Verse 1:] Girl I'm really sorry that it had to come to this. But I'm not going home with no fucked-up kiss. You can take this how you want, But you need to realize. That if you wasn't selling it, You shouldn't have advertised. Now Ima count to three girl, When I turn around, All I wanna see, Is your panties on the ground. I suggest you drop them draws girl, If you don't I will, I been spending all this time, now it's time you paid your bill.  [Chorus:] Strip! Get 'em off girl! Don't make me chase you! ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
This song's dedicated to my homies In that gangsta lean Why'd you have to go so soon  It seems like yesterday We were hanging round the hood Now I'm gonna keep your memories alive Like a homie should  A life time of memories Going down the drain I'd like to keep stepping But I can't get past the pain  I tip my forty to your memory Take a drink and I start to think And I, I know one day soon we'll be We'll be hanging out  This is for my homies (This is for my homies, well, well) See you when I get there In that gangsta lean In that gangsta lean  This is for my homies (This is for my homies, well) See you when I get there In that gangsta lean In that gangsta lean  My God, my God Would you pass on a message for me Ha, tell him, put down those Dice for a second, Lord Listen to his homie  Could you tell him I'll never let go of his memory ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
