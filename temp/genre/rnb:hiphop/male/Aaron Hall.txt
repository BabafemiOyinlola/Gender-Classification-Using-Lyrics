Képzeld el Képzeld el  Az órák ma szabadon múlnak, Szállnak a városon át, Csak veled állnak a percek.  A lángok nem szelíden gyúlnak Néha megéget a vágy, S a szerelem elszédít.  Ez a perc nem a vége A világom közepébe Írtad a nevedet a szélbe Otthagytuk a fényben  Ez a perc nem a vége A világom közepébe Értem, érzem nem megyek tovább.  Csak képzeld úgy, Hogy a zenétől a világ elnémult. Ne engedd el! ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
