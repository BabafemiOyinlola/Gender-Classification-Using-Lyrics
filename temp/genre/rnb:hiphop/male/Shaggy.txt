Beatriz Luengo Lengua letra Hoy me levanté y puse la radio Tu voz sonaba en stereo Me pregunté: “where you from?”  You, you cost me lots of pánico Todo se vuelve tan satánico Y a mí me gusta lo más básico  Abro ese baúl que guarda mis penas Y me pregunto: ¿Por qué amarte así es la condena? Y es que he tratado de sacar la sangre de mis venas Y separar el veneno que dejó tu lengua  Le le, le le, le le, le le le Le le, le le, le le le lengua   Le le, le le, le le, le le le Le le, le le, le le le lengua  Tú me despertaste con tu voz so sweet ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

All the years, since bittersweet, Are chapters in a story book, That still is incomplete. The falling leaves will tumble to defeat, But nothing's ever changed round here, On 22nd Street.

From way back here on the bandstand, She looked like a goddess in the lights, At some point in the set she'd turn her face and glance my way most nights, I'd take a little solo, I'd play for her, she'd smile, return the favor, I'd make the sweetest love to her with every semiquaver.  "There's a sadness in your playing," she said, "That penetrates my bones, Something in your intonation, something in your tone, Always understated, never overblown, My name for you is Sad Trombone. Yes, my name for you is Sad Trombone."  It seemed like she'd found the secret key to my soul, And gathered up my broken life and somehow made me whole, We'd share a room together, my bandmates were all green, And they warned me ‘bout some story in a movie they'd all seen.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
