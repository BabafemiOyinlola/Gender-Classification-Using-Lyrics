What Happened to our Hood? Things ain't the same no more, no more  What happened to our hood? It used to be all good. Now everything is out of control. It hurts me deep inside to see our people dying. Why o Why, why? We used to play games all night long now all my loved 1's are gone This ain't even cool it ain't even cool  Now I'm gonna tell you how it all got started. We was all young hard headed & broken hearted got caught up in the game, caught up in the hustle next thing you know we comin' with the muscle. Respect for the streets was invented in our souls but that's the way you moved if you wanted to grow old. Sooner or later somebody always caught a case but we was like A students in your mama's face. We knew the rules, respect for the king. My o My how the good can change Every fool you know saying Keep it Real but we was still real w/out our steel. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
