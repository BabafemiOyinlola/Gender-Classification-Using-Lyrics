Maybe first love never ever dies That's why I'm still in love with you  Hold me close and look into my eyes And tell me you don't feel it too The way it used to be when you told me It would be forever, you and me together And, we never really said goodbye We never really said its over  We never really said goodbye First love never dies When I saw you I could hardly speak Youre just as beautiful as ever babe I guess its still the same mystique First love never dies Maybe you just wasted all of your love We can't go back but we go on  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
