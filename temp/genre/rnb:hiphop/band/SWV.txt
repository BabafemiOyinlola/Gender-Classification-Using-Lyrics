You're the one I know
That you're the one for me
When in need you know
That you can call on me
Baby I know that you're the one for me
You're the one
You're the one for me
You want me but she needs you

Verse One: Jay Z

Besides this ma come out the V 2
Keep it on the R Kel's
Cos my girls the type who like a fight in the club
Go home and make love
Though I like the way you sex somethin'
Baby girl will wreck something
If she knew you and I were in the Lex fronting
A bottle of Cru, the crews about to make moves
Rendevousing, hotel day doing
Lover forget then fled the scene
Smelling like wet dreams, lipstick around the collar
Thinking about bed-screams and the way you holla
Boo, you make a nigga rise like tax on the dollar
No, you ain't no trick
Can't play you like a zero
Gave you a couple of chips for spending time with the hero
To the next time baby girl, never forget
You can't be with the one you love, love the one you with
I'm knowing...

You're the one, I know
That you're the one for me
When in need, you know
That you can call on me
Baby, I know that you're the one for me
You're the one
You're the one for me

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling I want to stay
Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you
I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
And something takes over me
In a daze your love's so amazing
Its not a phase I want you to stay
With me by my side
I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin makes me weak
Time after time after time I tried to fight it
But your love is strong it keeps on holding on

Lookin' at my Rollie
It's about that time
For SWV to drop
A jam on mine

Playa's talk the talk
But they can't walk it
We make the whole country bounce
When we New York it

Don't speak about it, be about it
Seein' Puff on your tube
Feelin' weak about it
I got the skill of an actor, wind chill factor

Minus five five, coolest man alive
Baby, who dat is? Oh, that's just Puff Daddy
Keep you on my mind
Like I keep me on my shine

And I feel fine, sex real time
While I'm in your deck on rewind
Oh, I make it hot, till you're jellin' what PD got
Since PD rock, see me not

So many bricks
I build a tenement
We'll do the freaky thing, baby girl
If you're into it

I'm looking for a lover that
Can make a sacrifice
A lover that will understand
Will always be by my side

SW with the V, yeah, you know
Characters, lacin' this trizack
Oh life is short, what?

I never thought I'd find love
Till the day I found you, sugar
I never had no one to hold me like this
Like this, like this, no, no, no

This time, last year, I was feeling so alone
I never thought that you would come along
You changed my whole world

Now all I have is memories
My lonely days are gone
You changed the right from wrong

(And I never)
I never thought I'd find love
Till the day I found you, sugar
(I never had no one)
I never had no one to hold me like this
Like this, like this, no, no, no

I never thought I'd find love
Till the day I found you, sugar
(I never had no one)
I never had no one to hold me like this
Like this, no, no, no

I never imagined just what it would be like
To have this feeling that I feel without you in my life
It's like a day of sunshine after days of cloudy skies
And when you held me in your arms, you opened up my eyes

Lately there seems to be some insecurities
About the way I feel where I wanna be
Boy, you know it's with you
No one can do the things you do to me

Never to be mistaking, long as it's love we're making
There'll be no hesitating
You and me, an that's the way it will be
And I won't leave your side
Cause you know

Love will be right here
Be right here, right here
Be right here
(Dont't you have no) No fears, have (no fear)no fear
(Don't shed) No tears (no tears) love is here

True love some don't believe in that's just what I'm giving
I'm gonna keep it strong, I'll be holding on to you
No one can do me like you do it's true
Sure as the sun is shining our love will keep on climbing
There's gonna be some rain gonna be some pain

You've been wondering how you can make it better
Baby, it's easy to turn my world inside out
Your discovery will take us to another place
Baby, on that, there is no doubt
I've been waiting for the special moment
Anticipating all the things you'll do to me
Make the first step to release my emotions
To take the road to ecstacy

You gotta go downtown
That's the way to my love
Take it round and round
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love
Go downtown, To taste the sweetness

Just rain on me...

Na na na chill chill chill chill freeze

No matter what the media hype
Ya still get wrecked

Calm my tempers down more cuz Biggie Smalls was enough
Save yo beef for the rice and broccoli
I lose my cool for gettin' the cheddar
So I suggest you better

You will know how to take it

If you got time then I got time, yeah, yeah
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes

So easily I did things I'd never dare

What is love?
Love is an experience everyone should have
It's not always fun but it's always special
A sweet struggle that seals the past and builds the future
A love that can never strike is an amazing love

Tell me why is love the way it is?
Joy and pain is all in the game of love
I don't know it's hard to say
But who am I to blame?
Love is so amazing, amazing

How many heartaches does it take till this girl becomes woman?
How many tears must I cry till my heart mends?
But as much as I try to get over it, my heart calls for you
Why is love this way?
Does it have to be this way?

So tell me why
Is it me?
Or is this how love should be?

When we New York it

Don't speak about it, be about it
Seein' Puff on your tube
Feelin' weak about it
I got the skill of an actor, wind chill factor

Minus five five, coolest man alive
Baby, who dat is? Oh, that's just Puff Daddy
Keep you on my mind
Like I keep me on my shine

And I feel fine, sex real time
While I'm in your deck on rewind
Oh, I make it hot, till you're jellin' what PD got
Since PD rock, see me not

So many bricks
I build a tenement
We'll do the freaky thing, baby girl
If you're into it

I'm looking for a lover that
Can make a sacrifice
A lover that will understand
Will always be by my side

Boy, I want you to listen closely to what I have to say
'Cause this is the way to my heart

You've been wondering how you can make it better
Baby, it's easy to turn my world inside out
Your discovery will take us to another place
Baby, on that, there is no doubt
I've been waiting for the special moment
Anticipating all the things you'll do to me
Make the first step to release my emotions
To take the road to ecstacy

You gotta go downtown
That's the way to my love
Take it round and round
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love
Go downtown, To taste the sweetness

Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
That gently touches my soul
It cools the fire that burns in me
And I simply lose control
So just...

Rain down on me
Let your love just fall like raindrops
Rain on me
Just rain down on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me...

Alone you and I intertwine
Refreshing conversation for the mind
As we stare we both seek and hope to find
Real love purified

Use your heart and not your eyes
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time, yeah, yeah
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes

I sigh as I watch you sleeping there
So easily I did things I'd never dare
I say to myself I'm glad that we share
Real love purified, oh

What is love?
Love is an experience everyone should have
It's not always fun but it's always special
A sweet struggle that seals the past and builds the future
A love that can never strike is an amazing love

Tell me why is love the way it is?
Joy and pain is all in the game of love
I don't know it's hard to say
But who am I to blame?
Love is so amazing, amazing

How many heartaches does it take till this girl becomes woman?
How many tears must I cry till my heart mends?
But as much as I try to get over it, my heart calls for you
Why is love this way?
Does it have to be this way?

So tell me why
Is it me?
Or is this how love should be?

When you cry
Boy I cry
Don't let go
Or I'll die

When u cry
Baby, I cry
And if you take your love away
I'll just die
If you love me once
I'll love you twice
So promise me
You'll love me for the rest of my life

There's no better place
I'd rather be than in your arms
Holdin' you close to me
Lookin' in your eyes
Let's me know
That you'll always be here
And your love ain't goin' away
Oh

Baby, I cry
And if you take your love away
I'll just die
If you love me once

About the way I feel where I wanna be

No one can do the things you do to me

Never to be mistaking, long as it's love we're making

(Dont't you have no) No fears, have (no fear)no fear

It's a feeling I want to stay

With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you
I get so weak in the knees

And something takes over me
In a daze your love's so amazing
Its not a phase I want you to stay

Baby, on that, there is no doubt

Anticipating all the things you'll do to me

Take it round and round
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love

We make the whole country bounce
When we New York it

Don't speak about it, be about it
Seein' Puff on your tube
Feelin' weak about it
I got the skill of an actor, wind chill factor

Minus five five, coolest man alive
Baby, who dat is? Oh, that's just Puff Daddy
Keep you on my mind
Like I keep me on my shine

And I feel fine, sex real time
While I'm in your deck on rewind
Oh, I make it hot, till you're jellin' what PD got
Since PD rock, see me not

So many bricks

We'll do the freaky thing, baby girl

Can make a sacrifice
A lover that will understand
Will always be by my side

Smelling like wet dreams, lipstick around the collar
Thinking about bed-screams and the way you holla
Boo, you make a nigga rise like tax on the dollar
No, you ain't no trick
Can't play you like a zero
Gave you a couple of chips for spending time with the hero
To the next time baby girl, never forget
You can't be with the one you love, love the one you with

You're the one, I know

What is love?
Love is an experience everyone should have
It's not always fun but it's always special
A sweet struggle that seals the past and builds the future
A love that can never strike is an amazing love

Tell me why is love the way it is?
Joy and pain is all in the game of love
I don't know it's hard to say
But who am I to blame?
Love is so amazing, amazing

How many heartaches does it take till this girl becomes woman?
How many tears must I cry till my heart mends?
But as much as I try to get over it, my heart calls for you
Why is love this way?
Does it have to be this way?

So tell me why
Is it me?
Or is this how love should be?

So let me hit you off with this nice and slow daddy

(Verse)
Love is come and go
But now it's here to stay
You made me so happy, the day you came my way
Every time I'm with you
I love you more and more
Cause you're the man, cause you're the man that I adore
I'm so in love

It starts with a thought of love and displace
I hold it with hope and inside me it stays
Then speak your reply but smile 'cause I know
Sometimes love shows in the phoniest ways

(When this feeling comes over me, will you be there?)
To receive and let this love breathe
(When this feeling comes over me, will you be there?)
To receive and let this love breathe

Curiosity, has it's part, is it just my body?
Or does it include my heart?
(We can't make moves until I'm sure)
I've tried, but it just makes me want you more

What's it gonna be
Is it gonna be you and me?
What's it gonna be
Is it gonna be you and me, babe?

Wasn't it you who said
"We'd be together always?
I think I've been misled
It took a while to see, but now

One of us has to go
You just can't love two, no, tell me

What's it gonna be
Is it gonna be you and me?
What's it gonna be
Is it gonna be you and me, babe?

I wanna be there for you
Will you be there for me
That's what I'm here for
That's what I live for
That's what I give for
I wanna be there for you will you be there for me, for me

(Verse)
You should know by now how I feel
That my love is real
Feels secure knowing
You've got my heart in away
I can never stray
But now people talk
They say our love won't last (love won't last)
They say my love for you
Soon it will (past)
But you should know for sure
I will never leave, you're all the man I need
I hope you see

(Chorus)
That's what I'm here for
Giving you all of my love
That's what I live for
To be the only one you dream of
That's what I give for

Never been the searchin' type, no, not me
Friends always said I was too naughty
Cause I loved with all I've got
Never think of holdin' back
I won't let fear control me
I've come to know a little 'bout love, you see?
I know it don't come around every day, especially for me
So I'm standin' here, playin' for keeps
And I hope you feel the same about me

Could you be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need (need)
Someone to love me unconditionally (unconditionally)

Could this be?

That is really all I need (all I need)

You're telling me that you love me 
But boy you know 
That you belong to another girl who loves you 
You are so fine, (so fine, so fine) 
You blow my mind

(She sees) She's not blind, she's not blind 
Things you do for me, but I know 

I'm so into you 
I don't know what I'm gonna do

That's the way to my love
Take it round and round
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love
Go downtown, To taste the sweetness

Love is just like a storm
No sunshine at all

Oh, boy, you know that I care for you

Oh, yeah. You don't have to be scared of me

I'm a type of girl with class but you never know what you can get
'Till you go and ask for it, I was shy but now I finally see
All you have to do is just ask for anything you want
It's yours, you get right to the point, if love is what you really need
Don't be shy, just say, "Boy, give it to me right now"

Give, give, give it to me, baby, baby, boy
I need you right now, give, give, give it to me
Honey, honey, give, give, give it to me, baby
Give it to me, give it to me

You feel real good deep inside my whole life
You're rubbing me inside me body, take me on a natural high
You love me the way I want you to and you know I like it
I like it when you touch my face, love me, oh, in a private place
You know you're all I really need, don't be shy with me, don't be shy

Give it to me, give, give, give it to me, baby, baby, boy
I need you right now, give, give, give it to me
Honey, honey, give, give, give it to me, baby
Give it to me, give it to me

Boy, be quite, follow me and tip toe
Don't wanna make too much noise
Sneaking in your window
So pull down the shades

'Cause my neighbors are kind of nosy
Comfy, cosy, now off with the clothes-y
Can I get a witness? Betta fitness
Baby, we can do it, take your time, do it right

Lick my belly button, whisper sweet nothings
In my ear to get my hormones in gear
Now, mamma's little baby loves toast and jam
Melts in your mouth but not in your hand
Black pudd'n

Separates the boys from the men
You can knock all day Jehovah but you can't get in
Maybe you can get a scoop, if you're really all of that
And you can leave your fake fingernails in my back
Now, I may not be a lady but I'm surely all woman
So check it, the proof is in the pudd'n

Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick, girl?
I wanna get a taste of your pudd'n

Must be Jell-O, 'cause pudd'n don't jiggle like that
Yeah ain't that a fact, pull out your spoon
And let's begin the mixing, always in the bedroom
Never in the kitchen you can get busy

Over and over I imagined all the things I'm gonna do
Soon, it will be time for this fantasy to come true
I've got something special I wanna try on you

First, we kiss, then relax while I bring you some wine
Take off your shoes, get ready for a real good time
Tonight is yours and I belong to you
So let's get started, we've got some loving to do

It's about time for us

To give good loving all night
So many times I've opened up my heart
Only to have someone tear it apart, that's why I need

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I don't understand

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down
When you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

You are so fine, (so fine, so fine)

Never too much to be takin' this for granted (no no no, no no no)
Swear to God, I'm here for you

Baby don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete
Boy, you're my heart and I'm down for you rich or poor

If you'll still be right here
I put it all, everything I love
You're my everything and it will hurt if you'll leave

I'll still be right here
I put it all, everything I love

I'm, I'm too sexy, check my worth
Boy, don't get your feelings hurt
Chasin' skirts, so converse
Tryna get this dairy queens to desert
Got that yummy, blaze it, blaze it
You heard mine's just more expensive
Get a ninja in my benzer
I see you and and all your friends'

And I see it in your eyes that you miss us
Pockin' SWV, now you and me
Or drive past when I say I missed us
Guess keep or can escaped us
I'm so low, gettin' flicked up
I'm singin' do you, do you, do ya?
Sing or do me, now what you boo ya

I'm feelin' myself, I know I'm fly
I'm done with the pain, doin' better things
I'm movin' on, I'm goin' out
I got plans, I got places to be

Am I the best thing ever happened to you?
I'm the best thing ever happened
My love was took for granted, now you see
I'm the best thing ever happened

I know what's your brand of girlfriend
Really, do you think she's better?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

Do you miss my kisses on your lips
As you did with your new girl?

He tapped me on my shoulder, so unexpected
I started to hug him but paused for a second
And that's when he showed me an old picture that he had oh
Then we started talkin' and reminiscin'
And at first I smiled, then I started to remember
That my memories of us are all bad
That's when I told him

It took me some time to get over you
Had to wrap my head around what I let you do
I was young, I was dumb, I played the fool
But one thing today prove
I gave you the best years of your life (of your life)
Now you wanna get back what you missed
But I cannot forget about what you did
I gave you the best years of your life, your life
I gave you, yea
I gave you the best years of your life

I ain't gonna lie, for a while I was bitter
Acid to my stomach every time I saw you with 'er

Ba-Babe,
You say I'm the one who misleaded you
I say you wasn't there when I needed you
You say you wanna know if I'm leaving you
I said I'll stay
Only if you step up and start being true
Don't let nothing come between me and you
I, I, I won't stick around and be a fool for you baby
You think that I'm giving up
I think that you're scared of us
You forgot we fell in love
What are we both gonna do now
I think that you think that I think that
We're not gonna be
I think that you think that I think
This ain't where I wanna be
I missed us how (we used to make love)
I missed us how (there was so much trust)
I missed us how (it wasn't 'bout you and me)
It was all about us, us
Ba-Babe

She got my eyes, she got my hair
Go on and stare, complexion to sing
It wouldn't be the same if you knew she didn't care
About you the way that I do now
So don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

I'ma keep it one hundred
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why
She ain't got nothin' on my, uh-ah
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

I'm gon' shoot you
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why
Well, I'm gonna shoot you while I'm fin up
Fin up, fin up, fin up, fin up to now

She doesn't cook, she doesn't clean
Steam you jeans, she doesn't rush
Doesn't take much to do to win your love
You're something in common we share
But don't go thinkin' that she's better than I

Boy, you got plenty to choose
Boy, don't forget 80-20 rules
So why she dance? It don't even matter

Riding around going out with that other lady
While I'm sitting at home with your baby
Fool me once then I put the blame on you
Fool me twice now it's a shame on me
I break my heart I'm gonna drive me crazy
All those times you slipped I kept you here
You still running out it's not fair
Boy you think you know but you have no idea
How I love you so and I need you here
Boy you think you know but you have no idea
How I'm dying slow, slow

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way

The minute I close my eyes, surprise me
With your ooh, aah, oh, woah
(Don't be shy, don't be shy)

I need someone to hold
Someone who will make my body
 (Feel so good that it starts to tingle, oh)
If you give me the chance
 (The chance)
I will take romance
 (Romance)
To new heights, new levels of ecstasy, ooh

It's alright to come hold me
Don't be shy just love me
The minute I close my eyes, surprise me
With your ooh, aah, oh, woah

It's alright to come hold me
Don't be shy just love me
The minute I close my eyes, surprise me
With your ooh, aah, oh, woah
...
