Now who was the nigga that came back ridin' dirty, stylin' murda
With a weapon up under my seat, you creep, indeed you'll meet the burner
Burn baby, burn burn burn, set em on fire
And I'm really not near with a nigga but see it's whatever, whatever, I'm wired
Feel the 12 gauge eruption - Playa hata dead now
No more discussion - Swimmin' in his all red now
Empty out yo pockets, if it's blinging, nigga drop it
Is it pistols, means it's nonsense - That mean murda if I cock it
Mo murda, mo murda redrum
Catch you niggas slippin' and I hit you with this lead son
Split your fuckin' wig and leave you drippin', make you bled some
I'm here to battle if you don't come with a weapon
A lyrical monster - My niggas are comin' to bomb yah
My niggas'll critically calm ya
The bullets, they enter, they calm ya
We steady be ready for drama - I'm willing to bet on my momma
Before we leave this bitch I betcha show me nuff respect

(Flesh:)
Hard dog from the hall of fame, Thor
That's for they know the real me in the pain
I wish I could do this plain
But that's impossible when there's too many lame...
Ho's running around, calling they self hot
We sure that you need is the fake and fraugulent in out of Pac

Sit back and just chill

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was O.K.
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry

So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to

And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin the dooehouse

Pullin' in the driveway, wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up

Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me."

But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won’t budge

Thangs can get rough, when you live in the ghetto
You gotta survive, no matter the pain
Nigga be hurting, life'll be hurting
But nigga for certain, this is the game
Man don't let them win, never let the system think they got you
If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, went to throw it at em
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollas
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'ma live everyday
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory
What you thought I play for keeps
Put it down wicked in these streets
Heavily armored with the heat
Just in case a nigga want some beef
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on

Money money, the mighty dolla dolla
Got to get my grind on, grind on, grind on
I don't wanna be broke no more

You ain't worthy, none of you niggas could stop me
And none of you niggas could hurt me
If worse come to worse, I'ma get down and dirty
Though the Ouija can't curse me, NWA
Eazy E, that's the nigga that birthed me, hey
Thug style motherfucker, live forget ends

Nigga we represent the planet get schizophrenic n

How do you manage? Paranoid, don't even trust my

I'm smokin in the alleyz with these ghetto guns and
erased my funds Watts, niggas in Cali take bullets to

Heaven'll move me right fo
sho deception weather my brethren but sunny days when
they parlay get killed when they get tah steppin

the ocean those frivolous thoughts but I'm brought up

mention I love my lady

And the palm trees lean
Been ballin', shot callin' since 83

Ain't ready for me
Or these ghetto fab queens
Already platlum in the streets
I even got them jail house niggas

Sendin' they cheese to me
Big Chan in japan
Bitch, I'm over seas

Watch me hidy flice these hoes
Leave 'em short changed
Take they fame and roll
Watch 'em all fall to the flo'

Don't hit me no mo'

I kill 'em with words
Serve 'em like them dealas
Do them birds, ya heard me

Can't a mothafucka serve me
I still hold the title
Repossessed it from some of my
Greatest idols

You punk ass, bitches is hollow
I cave yo whole fuckin' chest in

Hold it down, it's goin' down

And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in the touch
Instead of usin' my muscle
And everytime I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder

If it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam'
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man
Got a soul program
I'ma pump my fist

And you can put this on Wish

And when I needed a ride
You wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my cris

You wanna change ya life

Can you tell me why these niggas bleedin'
Needin' general assistance
Out here needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet
But see? so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See the real niggas ready out here taken control
See I'm screamin' out Mo'

Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' distrust to my spouse

So to all you bustas out there, beware

So it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen and I'm low on ends, fuck calm

I tried to stay thug, got flowin' skills but nigga
They bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the 44 Mag' plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag can't reveal when I glide
With the moneybag

Ride to the hide', count my flags
I be livin' on the dark side and I can't escape
Some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is
If I play with my gauge

It's a raid, put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets
Watches, jewels and you'll be safe

I snatched the clerk up by her neck
Put the gun in her mouth and said
"Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
If you wanna be killed try some stupid shit"

And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
L locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail, well, tickets
I'm out the door, hopped in the smug and I break fast

Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, locked out
As I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight, covered my tracks

Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine and if you stall then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid, I'll rob you
See a nigga creep on ah come up

Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

We're not against rap

Step up, hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin, straight buzzin, lovin yo peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring yo weapon, when steppin
Bring on that ammunition, trippin' on sip

But i gotta get mine, so scream out, mo, and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the bone, mo' thugs will follow
Chain gang, remains the same
Flamin my dank and drinkin brew
Thinkin about hangin, clockin my bank, and thuggin trues, foo's

And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin the dooehouse
Smoke jump outta me bong
So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge
I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay
Pullin' in the driveway, wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up
Buck, Buck, and a kaboom

Come and look deeply in my eyes (with Layzie: my eyes)

Told me if he should decease, "well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me."

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won’t budge
Grudge, because there’s no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?

You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be
Feeling similarily
And led to believe, I was okay
To just walk away
From the one thing that's unyielding
And sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalaunt about it
And I'm going to extremes, to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly loosing my mind
Underneath a guise of a smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel, and I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal, the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise, till I go home at night
And turn down the lights and then I breakdown and cry (cry cry cry)

So what do you do, when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain and rejection it's putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing "I Will Survive" (get control hold on, hold on)
Do you lash out and say (hold on, got to get control)
"How could you leave me this way" (hold on hold on)
Do you hold on in vain (hold on)
As they just slip away (got to get control hold on)

Burnin in my Benz, and I'm here, nigga
Don't you ride with me, you have to learn it

Hot child in the city
Walkin' round lookin' pretty
Playas call M Sidity, fuck pitty

Chitty, chitty, bang, bang
It's a west side thang
Bitches get banged on
And stole on

In the city where the grass is green
And the palm trees lean
Been ballin', shot callin' since 83
I know the mothafuckin' industry

Ain't ready for me
Or these ghetto fab queens
Already platlum in the streets
I even got them jail house niggas

Sendin' they cheese to me
Big Chan in japan
Bitch, I'm over seas
I'm pimpin' this gat

Watch me hidy flice these hoes
Leave 'em short changed
Take they fame and roll
Watch 'em all fall to the flo'

It's a T K O
All you heard was Big Chan
Don't hit me no mo'
Shit this ain't a game

Street niggas know the M O
I kill 'em with words
Serve 'em like them dealas
Do them birds, ya heard me

Can't a mothafucka serve me
I still hold the title
Repossessed it from some of my
Greatest idols

You punk ass, bitches is hollow
I cave yo whole fuckin' chest in
My nigga young Lay
Hold it down, it's goin' down

Like Holyfield and Tyson
This is for them bitch ass hatas
I'm signin' off, I'm kickin' ass
And takin' names, late, late, late

I'm still the greatest
I'm pretty, I'm still the greatest
And I'ma bad man

Or ridin' the hustle I gotta get mine, bottom line
Most of my time I'm out here puttin' in work
For all of my days that I run this earth
I'ma make it count for what it's worth
You never know about this life and the type of pain that it can bring
That's why you gotta get off of you're thing cuz it ain't no dream and it 
ain't no game
We so serious, dogg you know it don't stop
I know time is the devil's workshop

See I do it I did it
And y'all know that I'm wit it
I'll give anything for passin' and take to it back
A hustlin' little brother with crack
But now I grind a little bit harder
Harder my niggaz stories in order
See, it was hard for me momma
My mother dropped in the water
My sister was damn fast, Heather was right behind ya
Cassie, that's my little sister
My father loved you like the only child
Funny, he ain't never seen my smile

Thangs can get rough, when you live in the ghetto
You gotta survive, no matter the pain
Nigga be hurting, life'll be hurting
But nigga for certain, this is the game
Man don't let them win, never let the system think they got you
If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, went to throw it at em
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollas
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'ma live everyday
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory
What you thought I play for keeps
Put it down wicked in these streets
Heavily armored with the heat
Just in case a nigga want some beef
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on

Money money, the mighty dolla dolla
Got to get my grind on, grind on, grind on
I don't wanna be broke no more

You ain't worthy, none of you niggas could stop me
And none of you niggas could hurt me
If worse come to worse, I'ma get down and dirty
Though the Ouija can't curse me, NWA

The name is Krayzie "
Big Bad Ass" Bone, wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, along with some cash, even took the mayor's daughter.
Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it, so I brought her.
Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble, double-crossed by the law, so there's nobody to run to: yeah,
it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun.
Outlaw--call him Leather Face.
I'm headed for the West, heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet.
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown.
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown.
So, I continue my mission.
It's gettin' dark, so I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns--they like to catch ya, then they
rob and split.
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool,
protectin' my chips.
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes.
Stop my horse. "
Whoa, Nellie!
Who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out."
Who is this?
I hope this ain't the law.
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun.
C'mon out, right now.
I'm gettin' angry." Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot.
It's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer."

I been stuck in the struggle
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in the touch
Instead of usin' my muscle
And everytime I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
If a nigga pull my number
If it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam'
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man
Got a soul program
I'ma pump my fist
I'm stayin' ready for this
And you can put this on Wish
I never seen the abyss
And when I needed a ride
You wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my cris
You niggas all on my dick
I wanna change the world
You wanna change ya life
I wouldn't a put up a fight
If I knew it was trite
They say everything happin' for a reason
Can you tell me why these niggas bleedin'
Needin' general assistance
Out here needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet
But see? so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See the real niggas ready out here taken control
See I'm screamin' out Mo'
With my pockets on swoll
Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' distrust to my spouse
Casuse I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out

Been around the world like a rolling stone
Seen the whole world wide through my own eyes
Been a long time coming
A million miles and still running
Tryna find my way back
To my roots where the true thugs lay at
And I say that, "I'm tryna go home
Take me somewhere that
My mind mode is on free
And my time zone is on freeze"
Everything stop!
I'mma need a little bit of time to get myself together
In the mean time I turn best to better
And in between time trying to be blessed forever
I hear home calling back for me

I think it's time I take a flight
To elevate my mind and make it my life
Been tryna get right
The big lights blinding me, they bright
I've been in darkness most my life
So I fight with all of my might
To make it back one day
Nigga someday it'll all work out someway

Thinking you deserted, everybody say you ain't here

World ran by the Devil, I be yelling but they can't hear
Everything mixed up, need to be fixed up
And all the politicians say they got the answers
But every time they vote em' in it didn't matter
'Cause then it show em' once again it don't matter
I just wanna let you know before they tryna hold on
I already know you know it even though we may not show it

Or is that something I'm telling myself to sleep at night
Please say I'm worth it
Cause theses demons are not letting go of my crippled mind

Tryna stay alive and survive through this thunder storm
But what did I do, what did I do wrong?
And my bad, man?
Cause I tried to get the things I never had, man
Was dealt the bad hand
But I maintain my life and changed my life
Even with these cards, I play the game write

And you just what I need right now
As I breeze through the clouds
Ain't no need to fly down, c'mon

Lovely, love me long time
Come hop in my fly Mercedes, baby
Just for tonight I beg ya ma'am you're my lady

Feel like I'm losing my breath, My heart beating slow

But I just don't know why we did that

Wind Blow

[Layzie Bone:]
Bone Thugs n Harmony
A yo we aint always been accepted like this till (Listen to the wind blow)
A nigga got dat Grammy
Open the door nigga,

Bone Thugs got a story that's similar to Mike Jones
You can ask my homies
I'm memba back in the days they didn't want me
Now I blew up they all on me
They smiles phony
It's hard to determine who really is rich or which of these niggas is fake
They tryna eat out of yo plate
And you can't get a break
Now how much can you take
For heavens sake
I can't wait they gone be
(Listening to the wind blow)

[Krayzie Bone:]
Sittin back blowin on indo
Waving wit my middle finger hangin out the window lets roll
Get yo muthafuckin hand out my pocket
Now they wanna be wit a nigga
Feel like we partnas
Nigga we was lookin for a deal and you dodged us
Neva did call us
Where was yo promise
But now we ridin by
(Listening to the wind blow)

[Wish Bone:]
Nigga to the real to the sets
When it comes to the streets
Livin peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto
Give all peace won't let is go
Say we wouldn't make it
Now we some of the greatest
Bumpin through the trunk and yo ra yo radioooo

[Chorus: x2]
And if don't love me now
You'll never love me again
I can still here you sayin'
You must never
Break the chain

Krayzie:
Dedicate this to all the niggas on the streets; niggas
in the hood strugglin', doin' what the fuck they gotta
do to make their money; and all the thugs,
the hustlas, the gangstas,
the playas, pimps. Let's roll,
let's roll.[. . . ghetto love,
ghetto love. I can feel that ghetto love, ghetto love . . .]

Street people [people] All my people be them niggas
with an attitude. [We're ready for war.
] The street mentality: it's do what you gotta do [do what you gotta do].

I dedicate this to the niggas in the hood [Where they
at? Where they at? Where they at?
], keepin' it real on the street.
Niggas they practice what they preach,
stayin' true until they D-I-E.
Niggas still strong. We keep on bailin' through the
stress and all the rest of the shit that's goin' on.
Speakin' of violence, I see,
you got to keep a pistol, 'cause if niggas think you're
rich, you gon' be got, they out to pinch ya.
Bullshit you not--killin' because of the pump,
and it drives us to the point of no return,
especially when you 're gone off of the sherm.
You could give a fuck about a nigga flossin'.
While you walkin', he on sixteen switches.
Ain't that a bitch? But that's life.
This shit ain't nothin' nice,
and he'll take yours if his ain't right.
And I can't stop 'em or knock 'em,
but yo, I wouldn't even try,
though. 'Cause Bible say, "Hey,
either repent or you will die.
" So [so, so], choose one [just one]: either repent
and get saved, or put some food on your table for now.

Bury me by my grand, grand and when you can, come follow me

God bless you working on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, God is who we praise
Even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace

For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I'm guessing my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Oh, what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold?
We living our lives to eternal our soul, aye-oh-aye-oh

Pray and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray

And we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray
Still we laced, now follow me roll stroll

Whether is tell of his Heaven

The drama just goes on and on.
Drama be just part of my life,
life. It's been like that since I was born.
Yes, I can run, but I can't hide.
Gon' be like that until I'm gone,
gone. Drama always seems to find me, find me, find me.

Roll down-a my family tree with me.
Keep flippin' the page to page--see nothin' but strugglers.
I never knew no hustlas like my daddy and mama.
So I gotta drop my Pz, but I think way back in the
day now, when Moms and Pops had my back.
They stayed down and gave us a place to lay down.
But then, then when the wind blew in,
it threw in a crackpot. But lately,
it's keepin' my people up off the hinges.

Can I get a witness baby? And I'm out the door,
gots to go make me some money on my own.
Somebody tell me now where we went wrong.
God, bring my family back because they long gone.
It's on. Now Pops don't even come around,
but I know Pop's got problems.
That's why your little nigga's still down with ya.
But it hurts to see your family takin' a beatin'.
My sisters keep sayin' they hungry--gotta come up on

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

I'm tense, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see these gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen

Now ridin' with a new chick, she like "Hold up"
Next to the Play station controlla
It's a full clip and my pistolla
Send a jacker into a coma

Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Music turned up all the way to the maximum
I got speakers, some niggaz tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for um
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum, security cell

I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twins steady twistin' like "Hit this dough"
D's behind and it's in rethrowed

Windows down, gotta stop pollution
City change just like, "Who is that producin'?"
That's the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston, but I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin'
They hatin', patrollin and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Make sure you bring your Mary Jane, and personal lighter,

Make em fall, collapse, stumble, and fumble, just like drunk hoes.

I'm riding a caddy and daddy I'm rolling it sadly
But I don't mind, if they laughing at me
The movie I hardly think that they be singing singing
I never gave up on my lady, but she still ain't listening to me
Gotta let them 24's spin, chins ain't chipping or flipping
And let me get another victim again... gain-gain-gain-gain
And whether they don't gimme any hen or befriend them

You know what it is, you know what it was
So they wanna move dude, Watchu gotta do, who

You wanna hear some thug stories?

I knew this nigga that used to be large on the boulevard
This nigga was ballin y'all, big house driveway full of cars
This nigga would pull up in brand new Caddies, packed-up full of broads
Bossin, flossin, all his ghetto superstar
Until some young niggaz decided they was gon pull his card
And one night when he came home, they was in the bushes in his yard
As soon as he pulled up, they jumped out the bushes
And let out off they ammunation, but they didn't hit him, they missed him
(oh shit, hot damn!)
So homie ducked and rose backed up buckin off his shit
And hit one of them niggaz back off in the skillet, left him with his wig-split
And one of the niggaz, he dropped his GUN and started to RUN
As soon as he took one step, the nigga was DONE, DONE, he was DONE!
He took a shot to the abdomen, and as he blasted the last one
He'll survive it, but they wont be alive to tell that - thug story
Livin in the city is really, no nuts, no glory, no nuts, no glory, glory glory...

Thug Stories, you wanna hear some thug stories?
We got some real thug stories!

I jumped up, got my coat and walked right out of the door
Because she got a little bit crazy
I don't want no deranged lady
That'll have a nigga sleepin' under daisies.

I don't want another insane lover
Cuttin' on my rubber
Houndin' me just to tell her I love her
Gotta give it to them big butt girls
The ones that don't give a fuck
"Just-wanna-bust-nut" girls
When them feelings involved
Now you playin' with fire
Gotta let 'em know from the gate
Man, you ain't tellin' no lies
I just wanna (touch that)
I just wanna (couple times)
I just wanna (no ties)
Can a thugsta hit that there?
No need to blow me up one day, we right back here
Doin' what we do, I see you like that there
Baby girl, let me just keep this fair
You do you and I'll do me
Can we do it, do it like that?
Keep it creepin', creepin'
Yes they say it's better than sneakin', sneakin'
But when it's all over, it's just over
No knives or policemen

Ready be off 'em in a coffin, and a--all will be sprayed.
Follow the murderous gauge.
Follow me murderous ways.
Steadily pumpin' must my killas peel you.
Po-po was all I saw.
Pop-pop, outta the window.
We roll.
Little Ripsta realer off and better often swang, tossed off in a coffin with bangs.
Slang on the darkside, man.
Bang on the darkside, man.
Outta the thuggish ruggish city where all we bail, when I ran back to my lair with the twelve gauge Mossberg pumpin' shells.
You're bloody murder murdered.
Comin' to serve you, runnin' with gats and bats and more, and a fifth of Rose is how we roll.

:
Krayzie's on, and I crept and I came up.
Remember that killa, that nigga named Leathaface.
Now if you a thug, nigga pick up your pump and buck it.
Put the bitch up in the gutter, fuck it!
Nigga, we told ya.
Be fucked up and startin' this rap thang, now.
Never takin' no shorts or losses, man.
No way, no how, poppin' now.
I steady be thinkin' now that if I change my daily thang.
Nigga, don't hang with the phony busta niggas, only roll with thugstas, killas.
Beat 'em and gut 'em.
Me stick 'em.
Me stuck 'em.
We murdered them every time, now.
Bodies be drug off in dumpsters, execution double-nine style.
Hey!
Say, "
Give it up to the niggas who steady be slangin' that llello, bankroll." When the po-po roll, that's when you lay low.

We had to get 'em up with two guns, runnin' side by side with #1.
Bet I won't drop my gauge on when the po-po chase.
If they catch me barehanded, I'm done.
Rip's gripping the six-shot pump, so spill it.
Copper lettin' the lead off.
Copper thought that he had me caught.
Little Layzie blew his head off.
Get 'em up, and get up.
The bullets, they start to get lit up. #1 best start duckin' with a gun already buckin'.
We split up.
Bust a left on the double-glock and, where the fiends roll up for rocks, and this perfect getaway from the pigs when I peel, and I hit the fence and rippin' up the trench, and I'm bailin' while they trailin'.
Better in hell than in a cell, and ain't no tellin' where them copper be dwellin'.
One had spotted me, picked up a piece and shot at me, but I practice what I preach, so see the two slugs up in his body?--Got him!
Run with smoke comin' from the barrel of me gun.
Hit the bend.
Oh, what a dumb-dumb, I got yum-yummed on a dead end.
They set in then they lead in.
They wanted
me up in a coffin.
Cops from everywhere was yellin' and wailin'.

Now, dog, who ya gonna call?
Puttin' niggas in the coffin where they probably better off, and
Leathaface is not a punk-bitch
So a nigga just can't fuck me

Nigga better have me cash or I kill his whole family
When the twelve gauge pump blast
Now, test me
Never ever let a nigga ride
When he think he fin to slide, pump him in the spine
Get him for the money

Nigga tried to play me and dash
And that's why me thugs should put slugs in that ass
They telly and me never want to see no
Oh jealous muthafucka tried to keep a nigga's ends low

Gotta go whether fiends in the clique that's a no no
Gotta make that money, man

Even in the dummy game, niggas comin' up slain for collectin' they claim
Now, Leathaface, me pick up me gauge, grab the mask
And, nigga, me blast, so ya better respect us
When you see the bill collector rippin'
Killin' niggas for that mad money thang

Niggas steady payin' them dues, runnin' with trues
Nothin' to lose, everything to prove
Little thug from the C-Town, never caught sleepin'
Always on the come up creepin', runnin' this shit, now

They got my man from the Land. Never ran, I step with deadly men.
If ya come a little bit closer, I can turn you into sand.
Now follow me, now roll, stroll down to Cleveland.
We thuggin', we theivin', we put it in deep, and the blood is seepin'.

Me never knew one that could flow with the tongue. We comin' to shoot up your posse.

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely, so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend

But I predicted this endin', back in the day
'Cause I had visions of bad decisions knew niggaz would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still wanna make the loot

No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail, you play 'em wrong then you fail

It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
'Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw

And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We split up, we tied up, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin' the devil get in, to the pen, devils pretendin' to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass

Should of stuck the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin' snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

There's always something you got to give up

If you want everything you want

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want
There's always something you got to give up

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died all of my niggaz came to the church

And thanks for comin', I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin'
But I'm still rappin' get it all off my chest

So I came back to the action

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven follow the Lord all 24
7 days, God is who we praise even though the devil's all up in my face, but he keepin' me safe and in my place, say grace
And maybe you people should do to the same (The game) Recognize a good game man, tt's an everyday thang how we gotta maintain

Now follow me roll stroll whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone on their rest; Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
It's steadily creepin' up on the family
Exactly how many days we got lasting? While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away

Little Eazy's long gone, really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go bye bye, all a little thug could do was cry, cry

How many more day's on this old earth, can you see it's a crime to me
So we should get ready for Armageddon, 'cause I know God should be
Ready to roll, and do away with the wickedest shit like Mr. Policeman
And dog if you with it then pump up your fist in the air and pray for the politicians freely
Get an amen, the last days of the last days

[Bizzy]:
An' that's why I get high
An' that's why I get high

I'm holdin' on to my soul, but nobody knows and when it all unfolds
And then when I go, go, remember the days 'cause all that I get I get on my own with Bone
Bone, Bone, muggin', thuggin' through your door
Hoes speakin' of the last day, it's on when I'm past at trail, but what do you know
But I can't go wrong when I kick it with my song and turn it up
'Cause you love that thuggish, ruggish, bone, bone, bone

Crossroads, wanna rule the world, no I don't 'cause too many of us lost those

Fuck with the niggas with the guns and you might get shot, get shot
Get cha gun, get cha gun, did you kill 'em all?

You could be the first to feel the heat
to see how much we got, we got

I still be the thuggish ruggish nigga
Dressed in all black khakis, fatigues, and boots
Still don't give a fuck about the law
Still run with a pump in my car
And fuck who you are
You're fucking with a couple of niggas that's really insane
I'm talking loco, crazy as hell
It ain't just a name
It's the game
And we done loosened up a couple strings
And shook a couple of screws loose in my brain
Besides that, ain't nothin' changed
Look at me now I'm still a thug
Nigga I still smoke bud
You know I still represent St. Clair wig split shit, nigga what?
This is Bone Thugs niggas
Thinkin I told you but we put it down like that
And whoever we got to fuck up to prove that we do it
And keep on movin, guess who's back up in the house?
Original Cleveland Criminals
Niggas just send em subliminal messages like "murda, mo murder murder"
Never forgot where we come from
Watch how you move your tongue
Cause I got niggas that's ready to jump off in your ass
And smash and crash
Protect my niggas for combat
Leathaface at ya and on your ass like I was a heat seeker
Quickly the reaper peep you
Sweep you off your feet in Cleveland

[Layzie Bone:]
I be the smoothest little nigga you can meet me
But nigga you fuck with me then I'm a fuck with you
Introduce you to this heat
I sweep the street
When I draw down, let me hear you say "fuck the law now"
Rawest niggas in the town

like where was none for us.

back to the hood to the thugs and fiends.

And my Trophies
And my Plaques back to the hood.

Thuggish Ruggish from the 99

Check the record

give 'em something they can feel

Livin peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto
Give all peace won't let is go

You know don't nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder

I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man (a black man)
And I come from the dark side so I'm having a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back
Prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really im wrong and again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane
Chasing me dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me goin' craaaazzzy lately
I've been so faded
Tryin' to erase it

Jeremiah 10: 23, 24, we will know, oh Lord
That to earthly men, His way does not belong
It does not belong to man
Who must walk and even to direct his step

Correct me, oh Jehovah
However with judgment not in anger
That You may not reduce us to nothing

Order my steps in Your world

Order my steps in Your world, dear Lord
Lead me, guide me everyday
Send your anointing, Father, I pray
Order my steps in Your world

Why am I payin' this price for fame? Now with the shame
I'm to blame 'cause I'm solo empty
When I can stop and give it all to Christ
'Cause in His name no weapon should be formed against me

Simply know that the world gon' tempt me
Satan is the enemy, God please help us
I don't wanna be selfish
I don't wanna live my life tryin' to be rebellious

Who be checkin' when you know you doin' wrong, huh?
Got your steps, give your blessings
Know right from wrong, turn the lights on
All you gotta do is follow faith till they call us all home
But it's so hard, temptation is everywhere
Gotta hold my guard like, oh my God

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

But I'm tryin' to come back in the resurrection
Take my place in Paradise

Split the Swisher, quickly twist us up a fatty. 
Now, I've been smokin' out all day long, P.O.'d in the back of Krayzie's Caddy. 
How in the world did I manage to smoke this many? About a hundred, man. 
Feel it all in my stomach. 
To the brain severely blunted, and it ain't no shame off in my game. 
Hydroponics and Indonesia, even the stress sometimes be creeper, so pass me some reefer, want to receive, ah. 
Little Lay, givin' you what you need. 
Nothin' but the best green leaves with a pocket full of cheese, gettin' P.O.D.

My nigga, let's get P.O.D.'ded

The name is Krayzie "
Big Bad Ass" Bone, wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, along with some cash, even took the mayor's daughter.
Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it, so I brought her.

it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun.
Outlaw--call him Leather Face.
I'm headed for the West, heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet.
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown.
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown.
So, I continue my mission.
It's gettin' dark, so I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns--they like to catch ya, then they
rob and split.
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool,
protectin' my chips.
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes.
Stop my horse. "
Whoa, Nellie!
Who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out."
Who is this?
I hope this ain't the law.
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun.
C'mon out, right now.

Please don't shoot.

An' I'm thinkin' to my self that this might be a waste of my time
'Cause what if I don't even get high

Thirty minutes dun came by, I didn't even seem high
Until I stood up and looked at the ceiling for some reason
Now I'm tweakin', then I tried to walk but I was slow
I guess I'm floatin' in ecstasy
(Just like the nigga told me)

Step out the door and I'm rollin slow motion
I'm finna get down with my G's
Look 'round the crib and then pick up my keys
Hop in the Fo', then go so niggas don't know
I'm puffin on that... Reefer,
That chronic that grow from the trees
And now we smokin, throwin' up B's
And I got Bone Thugs on my team
You know we steadily drinkin' that liquor
Walk off in the club say wassup to my niggas and
I'm stumbilin' into that hydro
Look-at-me eyes low with a pyro
Smokin the same in Indonesia, and Cairo
I'm back to back in them blunts
Now where-did-me light go
Before I get psycho, lets get high bro
Sitting and choppin' with Krayzie
Stuffin that haze inside-a-me swisha man
Layzie, Flesh, Wish
And never forgetting my nigga Bizzy and
Aimin' slow on Mr. Ouija
Better know who the boss
You don't wanna get tossed in the river man,
East 99, on the grind, it's feel the same

(Put the purp in the blunt)

Got a call from Compton
Celebratin' real niggas so you know that I'm comin
Laced up
Little bit of sun, little bit of fun
They got love in Compton for Bone
Little Hennessy
A little Cali green
I'm floatin', chokin'
I'm gone
Look for something to poke on
I'm so high, got my Loc on
But I'm so real
Life is so chill
I'm a grown man
Nigga, fo' real
It's mine (mine)
Cuz I'm spendin'
Keep my hustle on so Ima get it
I'm in my own lane
Nigga pay tolls
Nigga no change, if anything
Betta have mine
Before the party stops
Nigga gun range...
Bop Bop Bop!!!

Well I'm in the back with a blunt
Steady get it in
First to the last of the month
Have 'em coming
Niggas think I don't smoke weed no mo'
Smell it, then I say pass the bong
We having a celebration
So gone I don't even know what the occasion is

Flow… round by the wind Ride with me.
Ride with me.
Who is that coming with the tongue
Like the double X ward?
talking out the neck
like we wouldn't push forward.
we murdered you niggas
and rap suckas
while you niggas
and we leave our competition
like where was none for us.
shit got board
back to the hood to the thugs and fiends.
sold crack in the hood
took my money
And my Trophies
And my Plaques back to the hood.
niggas weren't going out Hollywood not bone.
we keep it Gutta
Thuggish Ruggish from the 99
my paper hustle
been around the world a couple of times.
Check the record
you can see I am working double time
give 'em something they can feel
when I'm on the grind.
let the gangstas ride
In the summer time shine real bright.
if you wanna get down
let the top back slow
take a drag of the dro.
flipping hard time now
you can burn that now

Ride wit a G, everything will be perfect

'Til the wheels fall off, nigga, that's the purpose
Nothin' but the best 'cause we deserve it

They know when I'm comin'
'Cause niggas can hear me before they can see me
And they can't believe it 'cause I'm bumpin' Easy E
And they just seen me on TV

Navigatin' through the streets, dog
Keep it real to the beat, that ain't no secret
Jump outta the G car
Run up and them liquors store, hit the freezer

Grab a old gold like my 4-0
My flow so cold, I gotta have some
Turn the music back up to the maximum

A nigga got dat Grammy
Open the door nigga,

Bone Thugs got a story that's similar to Mike Jones
You can ask my homies
I'm memba back in the days they didn't want me
Now I blew up they all on me
They smiles phony
It's hard to determine who really is rich or which of these niggas is fake
They tryna eat out of yo plate
And you can't get a break
Now how much can you take
For heavens sake
I can't wait they gone be

Sittin back blowin on indo
Waving wit my middle finger hangin out the window lets roll
Get yo muthafuckin hand out my pocket
Now they wanna be wit a nigga
Feel like we partnas
Nigga we was lookin for a deal and you dodged us
Neva did call us
Where was yo promise
But now we ridin by
(Listening to the wind blow)

Nigga to the real to the sets
When it comes to the streets
Livin peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto
Give all peace won't let is go
Say we wouldn't make it
Now we some of the greatest
Bumpin through the trunk and yo ra yo radioooo

And if don't love me now
You'll never love me again
I can still here you sayin'
You must never
Break the chain

Bone Thugs... Akon, yeah

You know don't nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder

I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man (a black man)
And I come from the dark side so I'm having a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back
Prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really im wrong and again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane
Chasing me dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me goin' craaaazzzy lately
I've been so faded
Tryin' to erase it

Now you look from the jump and a nigga was thugged out,
But you bugged out, and start trippin
Flippin' on me all time, and it's been like this all my life,
no matter how I try
Guess it's the thug in me, got my mind on my money man
I'm spending my time on the grind tryna shine,
I'm concentrating on running thangs
I've been tryna hold it down, and you steady tellin' me it's over now
She always talk loud, she always leave me but always come back around
That's just what we go through, and you know it's so true
Every time I slip up she behind me, gon' be right there to remind me

Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
With lyrics more potent than a viper's venom
One bite could kill 'em

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards

Steppin' out the limos the bitch soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me his roll or loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to Hell, 'cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga

Change the World

Change the World
Young homie, think before you shoot, murderer
Where will our children go
When there's no place safe where they can go

(Bizzy Bone)
And trouble may come and sometimes
You'll get pulled over by one-time
And when the 1999 rewinds, you didn't even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world, it's nauseatin
Everybody's hatin everybody, overrated
Why everybody actin agitated, I thought we graduated
Back in the saddle waitin, aboard the battle station
Haitin is a birth defect and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains, close open up the door, no more

(-Big B)
See we loosin this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin won't end
So I'm reachin high up above
Lord, let your blessings begin

(-Big B) 4x
And let's change the world, and let's change the world

Ridin wit my Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls

There's always something you got to give up

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely, so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend

But I predicted this endin', back in the day
'Cause I had visions of bad decisions knew niggaz would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still wanna make the loot

No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail, you play 'em wrong then you fail

It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
'Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw

And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We split up, we tied up, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin' the devil get in, to the pen, devils pretendin' to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass

Should of stuck the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin' snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died all of my niggaz came to the church

And thanks for comin', I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin'
But I'm still rappin' get it all off my chest

So I came back to the action

"Ghetto Cowboy"

You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)

The name is Krayzie, big bad ass bone,
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole,
Along with some cash I even took the mayor's daughter,
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with us so I brought her.
Dun got myself into a whole heap of trouble,
Double-crossed by the law so it's nobody to run to,
Yeah it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun,
I dun now call him 'Leatherface'.
I'm headed for the west heard they got a couple banks in town
That ain't been held up yet, well uh, I ought to make it by sundown,
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown,
So I continue my mission, it's gettin' dark
So now I'm watching for them damn injuns,
They like to catch up then they rob -n- split.
I'll be a rootin' tootin' shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips.
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes, stopped my horse,
"Whoa nelly! Who in the bushes, you better speak up,
Or I'mma let my shotgun's song sing out."

Who's this? Hope this ain't the law, draw out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun.

"Come on out right now I'm gettin' angry."
Took a step back 'cause it could get dangerous.

"Please don't shoot it's just me Thug Queen Horse Stealer."

"Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes"

Devilish Eazy-E voice
Right about now, Thugs-N-Harmony is on a come up
So to all you bustas out there, beware

Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves

Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin'
A bank to get rich, ain't ate in days
So it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen and I'm low on ends, fuck calm

I tried to stay thug, got flowin' skills but nigga
They bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the 44 Mag' plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag can't reveal when I glide
With the moneybag

Ride to the hide', count my flags
I be livin' on the dark side and I can't escape
Some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is
If I play with my gauge

It's a raid, put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets
Watches, jewels and you'll be safe

I snatched the clerk up by her neck
Put the gun in her mouth and said
"Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
If you wanna be killed try some stupid shit"

And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
L locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail, well, tickets
I'm out the door, hopped in the smug and I break fast

Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, locked out
As I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight, covered my tracks

Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine and if you stall then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid, I'll rob you
See a nigga creep on ah come up

Bone Thugs Akon yeah

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard,
I tried hard... but I guess I
gotta try harder.

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,

But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later.

Bone Thugs... Akon, yeah

You know don't nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder

I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man (a black man)
And I come from the dark side so I'm having a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back
Prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really im wrong and again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane
Chasing me dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me goin' craaaazzzy lately
I've been so faded
Tryin' to erase it

Skull and crossbones, been Layzie when the Shop Boyz was babies
I was +Partyin Like a Rock Star+ in a hot car in the 80's
Can't play me, I'm crazy, I wish a nigga would
Snatch a nigga by his flesh and really represent the hood
Now the night is mine, I've been all around the globe
Chasin this money, doin them shows, playa I carry the whole load
See my family is my everythang, my money take care everythang
These nuts I let 'em hang, can't nobody do it better mayne
What's understood don't need to be explained, never
Ask Ronny to tell ya, I'm on a whole 'nother level
I do it cause I'm the shit-shit, you son of a bitch, I'm rich
How many times I got to tell these niggas to stay up off the dick?
We too big types for fist-fights, wanna start shit, how you been tight
My niggas is known to up pipe, squeeze on niggas like "Fuck life"
What I shine dawg, I'mma grind dawg, I remind y'all again
I don't do this to be famous, I do it for my kids

1 for the (shine) 2 for the (money!)
3 for my family cause my babies got to know

Devilish Eazy-E voice
Right about now, Thugs-N-Harmony is on a come up
So to all you bustas out there, beware

Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves

Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin'
A bank to get rich, ain't ate in days
So it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen and I'm low on ends, fuck calm

I tried to stay thug, got flowin' skills but nigga
They bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the 44 Mag' plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag can't reveal when I glide
With the moneybag

Ride to the hide', count my flags
I be livin' on the dark side and I can't escape
Some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is
If I play with my gauge

It's a raid, put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets
Watches, jewels and you'll be safe

I snatched the clerk up by her neck
Put the gun in her mouth and said
"Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
If you wanna be killed try some stupid shit"

And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
L locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail, well, tickets
I'm out the door, hopped in the smug and I break fast

Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, locked out
As I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight, covered my tracks

Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine and if you stall then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid, I'll rob you
See a nigga creep on ah come up

See no evil and I hear no lie, niggas don't wanna see me fly

Higher than a rocket ship, life is not rocket science

With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game
Imagine problems with crooked coppers
Why they wanna go there? Tried to pop me, lock me
But couldn't knock me off my square

I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see
Flesh stretched out without my thugs, one steady stressin' out
But we doin' our own thing, the Bone thing

Death has severed all my friendships
It's been hell ever since I've been here

All these fake niggas come to my funeral
Look at them sheddin' they dry tears
Look at my baby mamas and them trippin' out
Actin' a fool front of my kids

Then I got niggas puttin'
Drug paraphernalia in my casket
A spliff, a picture of me still livin'
And a bullet from a Magnum

Man, I feel bad for my family
But in death it's a safer place
Than bein' amongst these chumps and scavengers
Then one of my niggas say

He said, "I'll see you in the afterlife"
Don't he know that it's only G-O after life?"
My nigga been learned wrong
I don't plan on goin' to heaven

I'm tryin' to get ready for the resurrection
But until then I'm patiently restin'
Think of my sins, no need on me stressin'

So you wanna be a star, star
Never, never, never
So you wanna be a star, star
Never, never, never

I think you're gonna have to find who you are
Can't find your lane but you wanna be a star
A star, do you wanna be a star?
Can't find your lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star

I know the grind, she tryin' to be a star, she goin' hard
Doin' a hundred in the car but never could make it out the yard
'Cause you're stalled, how, when you can't even get it started?
It's probably 'cause you too naughty to get up in the party

She wanna make it so she'll sleep with him, late night creep with him
He'll tell her he can make her famous if she did him
Suck him, lick him, another victim of a bust and ditch 'em
Why must you suffer this when really love, what's the mission?

Because you still live in your daddy and your momma house
Shoulda knew homie was not about to go the dumber route
Left you with a lot of doubt, kinda like in a drought
Got no mo' integrity, slow flow, what you tellin' me?

There's jealousy goin' on, all because she wanna make it famous
And sip champagne with the greatest
So you wanna be a star, the ride you'll take is evident
You'll never get ahead so it's irrelevant

I think you're gonna have to find who you are
Can't find your lane but you wanna be a star
A star, do you wanna be a star?
Can't find your lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star

Baby girl can sing, she thick, man I think she got it
But they tellin' me to watch her, call her baby pockets
So I bring it to her straight, to a real knight
She got herself on protection, we all good all night

She said they only wanna cut, bustas never business

Hard times got my mind in bind.
I'll go crazy tryin to climb out the grime thats in my life (my life).
Im surprised I survived. It's amazin! (amazin) Im alive, I got by with my life!

Everytime I look around it seem like Im in trouble, pressured by the devil.
Lord I love You and I really trust You. Wish that I could hug You.
Disappear from the grain and the rubble and I'm tryin to keep from going under.
We ride, Eastside, blowin in the wind.
Each time I try, they lie, no lie! Judgin from the outside lookin in.
Never had a clue of what Id really do. The ghetto pushin through, but I'ma do it right.
Never buckle, never stop to struggle!
Layzie gotta muscle through the pressure, bust pipes, my life, highlights, bright lights, all right! Story of a warrior. My flight, final destination, thug motivation, time never wastin, pacin my stride.

Tryin to get it good! Feel the hustle and flow.
You know we are them mighty soldiers.
Had it been for all the shit we been through and doin whatever but God surely knows.

Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around

Everytime I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin' on a bad plan
Tryin' to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin' a thugsta

At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time

There's always somebody talkin' 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggas ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine

Everytime I turn around there's somebody straight trippin'
Hatin' on a mission, fakin' on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
Like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out

Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Everytime that I turn around
Somebody all up in my business

Actin' like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
Knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him

Everytime I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggas never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin' niggaz was weak but we showed 'em

We on top it ain't no stoppin' us, the suckas wishin' we would go away
So they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin' 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray
Kray, take action, Jackson

Everytime that I turn around
I'm duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Everytime that I turn around
Duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Everytime I turn around somebody doin' somethin' foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin' to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize but the clock
Is sayin' time don't wait for nothin', it don't stop

Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it
Like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop but y'all lucky
Eastside, front to back, we guard that
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat?

[Ricco Barrino]
Heyyy, wooo, ooooh
Hey yeah, ooh now

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
If I had one wish, that wish would be clear
That I would not have to go, that I could stay here
And although it hurts me, to leave you all alone
Just know I'll come back to you, for now I am gone

[Interlude: Krayzie Bone (Ricco Barrino)]
For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gooooooooooooooone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)
For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gooooooooooooooone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)

[Krayzie Bone]
When I'm dead and gone don't even worry
Don't mourn me too long, death'll get you discouraged
Keepin your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin
I know it for certain if I'm really restin in heaven
No need for you to fear, don't cry
Cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives
So I'ma be comin, be ready for the next shine
Cause I'm a believer that I'll see a resurrection
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin, no drippin, no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in piece 'til I prevail
It's just a temporary lay down, I won't forever stay down
So keep me in your memory, don't let me fade out
I'll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong, I'm gone gone, long gone

Put ya feet in the dirt, just push right through it

It's so many ways to die. Oh no! It's so many ways to fly.
Steady as we roll. It's so many ways to ride.
Cause life can't pass us by no more.

[Krayzie:]
Chillin on my mamas front porch,
I'm watchin. Sittin here reminiscing on how hot the
block gets. From right here I can truly see how crooked
the cops is. My vision gettin blurry as I look at my
options. I can just let em drop me,
or I can cock it and pop it.
The way they murdered Oscar was proposterous nonsense.
They talkin with they glocks,
conversation is violence, and they wonder why society
is criminal-minded. They never gon' change,
come around my way. Another one shot down,
slain, while the cop got praise.
It's hard to maintain when they supposed to protect
us. You or me could be the next one bleedin, injustice.

It's so many ways to die. Oh no! It's so many ways to fly.

you gotta keep it movin, gotta keep on steppin.
The Man Upstairs is our only protection.
It's very necessary you remember this is temporary.

Times tickin' all day, let me swoop up in your neck
of the woods. Everybody tend to they own hustle,

Steppin' out the limos the bitch soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me his roll or loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to Hell, 'cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck

Change the World
Young homie, think before you shoot, murderer
Where will our children go
When there's no place safe where they can go

(Bizzy Bone)
And trouble may come and sometimes
You'll get pulled over by one-time
And when the 1999 rewinds, you didn't even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world, it's nauseatin
Everybody's hatin everybody, overrated
Why everybody actin agitated, I thought we graduated
Back in the saddle waitin, aboard the battle station
Haitin is a birth defect and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains, close open up the door, no more

See we loosin this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin won't end
So I'm reachin high up above
Lord, let your blessings begin

There's always something you got to give up
(Yeah, I know)

(But shit I don't know, I don't know)

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely, so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend

But I predicted this endin', back in the day
'Cause I had visions of bad decisions knew niggaz would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still wanna make the loot

No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail, you play 'em wrong then you fail

It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
'Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw

And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We split up, we tied up, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin' the devil get in, to the pen, devils pretendin' to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass

Should of stuck the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin' snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died all of my niggaz came to the church

And thanks for comin', I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin'
But I'm still rappin' get it all off my chest

So I came back to the action

You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)

The name is Krayzie, big bad ass bone,
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole,
Along with some cash I even took the mayor's daughter,
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with us so I brought her.
Dun got myself into a whole heap of trouble,
Double-crossed by the law so it's nobody to run to,
Yeah it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun,
I dun now call him 'Leatherface'.
I'm headed for the west heard they got a couple banks in town
That ain't been held up yet, well uh, I ought to make it by sundown,
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown,
So I continue my mission, it's gettin' dark
So now I'm watching for them damn injuns,
They like to catch up then they rob -n- split.
I'll be a rootin' tootin' shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips.
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes, stopped my horse,
"Whoa nelly! Who in the bushes, you better speak up,
Or I'mma let my shotgun's song sing out."

Who's this? Hope this ain't the law, draw out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun.

"Come on out right now I'm gettin' angry."
Took a step back 'cause it could get dangerous.

"Please don't shoot it's just me Thug Queen Horse Stealer."

"Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes"

Split your fuckin' wig and leave you drippin', make you bled some

You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be
Feeling similarily
And led to believe, I was okay
To just walk away
From the one thing that's unyielding
And sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalaunt about it
And I'm going to extremes, to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly loosing my mind
Underneath a guise of a smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel, and I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal, the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise, till I go home at night
And turn down the lights and then I breakdown and cry (cry cry cry)

So what do you do, when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain and rejection it's putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing "I Will Survive" (get control hold on, hold on)
Do you lash out and say (hold on, got to get control)
"How could you leave me this way" (hold on hold on)
Do you hold on in vain (hold on)
As they just slip away (got to get control hold on)

We take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness
Surely livin' in the life it's for the thrills

Went through the whole drill

But there's nothin' they can do to the finest
Though they won't dare cross over the line for tryin'

Remain behind us, way behind

I never take my mission for granted
Since I'm cool they go and take it for weakness

Take it to the streets and let the pump, pump go “Pow!” 
Take my style, let me show you how I go wild. 
Now you playin' with a fully-grown man, with a fully-blown plan, with a fully-loaded clip. I’ma go up in your shit.
 I don't play with little kids, I spank that ass, boy you know who we is! 
(Bone, Bone, Bone!) My homies the greatest! 
I roll with the best, see? Who in the fuck wanna test these niggas from the S-C-T, C-L-E? We got heat! 
Y'all know what happened to the thief when the king catch him stealin’, got his hands in the cookie jar. 
Off with his hand! Fuck it, off with his head! 
Make him stand front and center, let me see what the rookie got?
Bet a nigga ain't got nothin', they bluffin'! 
Tryin’ to come up on somethin', 
bubblin'! I’ma say this really, really, really loud! 
Y'all wanna rumble, I’ll bust them, rush them! Trust him, never! 
On a whole 'nother level. If God The Creator, then y’all niggas’ devils. 
The fight won't end 'til the war get settled. 
And Bone gonna win ‘cause them Bone niggas' rebels. 
Playa!... Yeah!… Nigga!

Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
Everybody wanna rap like, rap like, rap like Bone, Bone, Bone! 
As we continue to pick up the pieces, they follow us Kings ‘til the sundown. 
Deadly issues of telekinesis, better show love or lay down.

They don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me fly
Don't wanna see me ride

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)

As long as I'm alive, no hater gon' never stop my drive
I get it and make it multiply, anything else is suicide
Enemy of the world, that's I energy of an eagle eye
See no evil and I hear no lie, niggas don't wanna see me fly

Higher than a rocket ship, life is not rocket science
Every day is documented, all of my time is occupied
I'm gon' grind and I'm gon' shine, ballin' 'til the end of time
Hate on me and it's all fine, you just ain't no friend of mine

I'm tryin' to focus on bigger and better things
With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game
Imagine problems with crooked coppers
Why they wanna go there? Tried to pop me, lock me
But couldn't knock me off my square

I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see
Flesh stretched out without my thugs, one steady stressin' out
But we doin' our own thing, the Bone thing
You suckas fail every time tryin' to stop my shine

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)

Stay away, fade away, playa hater
Stay away, fade away, playa hater

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bone, it's goin' down, man
Yo, this how we do it

Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me

Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me

Now that I'm dead and gone
I finally got these niggaz up out of my business
Death has severed all my friendships
It's been hell ever since I've been here

All these fake niggas come to my funeral
Look at them sheddin' they dry tears
Look at my baby mamas and them trippin' out
Actin' a fool front of my kids

Then I got niggas puttin'
Drug paraphernalia in my casket
A spliff, a picture of me still livin'
And a bullet from a Magnum

Man, I feel bad for my family
But in death it's a safer place
Than bein' amongst these chumps and scavengers
Then one of my niggas say

He said, "I'll see you in the afterlife"
Don't he know that it's only G-O after life?"
My nigga been learned wrong
I don't plan on goin' to heaven

I'm tryin' to get ready for the resurrection
But until then I'm patiently restin'
Think of my sins, no need on me stressin'

Now that I'm gone

So you wanna be a star, star
Never, never, never
So you wanna be a star, star
Never, never, never

I think you're gonna have to find who you are
Can't find your lane but you wanna be a star
A star, do you wanna be a star?
Can't find your lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star

I know the grind, she tryin' to be a star, she goin' hard
Doin' a hundred in the car but never could make it out the yard
'Cause you're stalled, how, when you can't even get it started?
It's probably 'cause you too naughty to get up in the party

She wanna make it so she'll sleep with him, late night creep with him
He'll tell her he can make her famous if she did him
Suck him, lick him, another victim of a bust and ditch 'em
Why must you suffer this when really love, what's the mission?

Because you still live in your daddy and your momma house
Shoulda knew homie was not about to go the dumber route
Left you with a lot of doubt, kinda like in a drought
Got no mo' integrity, slow flow, what you tellin' me?

There's jealousy goin' on, all because she wanna make it famous
And sip champagne with the greatest
So you wanna be a star, the ride you'll take is evident
You'll never get ahead so it's irrelevant

I think you're gonna have to find who you are
Can't find your lane but you wanna be a star
A star, do you wanna be a star?
Can't find your lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star

Baby girl can sing, she thick, man I think she got it
But they tellin' me to watch her, call her baby pockets
So I bring it to her straight, to a real knight
She got herself on protection, we all good all night

She said they only wanna cut, bustas never business

Hard times got my mind in bind.
I'll go crazy tryin to climb out the grime thats in my life (my life).
Im surprised I survived. It's amazin! (amazin) Im alive, I got by with my life!

Everytime I look around it seem like Im in trouble, pressured by the devil.
Lord I love You and I really trust You. Wish that I could hug You.
Disappear from the grain and the rubble and I'm tryin to keep from going under.
We ride, Eastside, blowin in the wind.
Each time I try, they lie, no lie! Judgin from the outside lookin in.
Never had a clue of what Id really do. The ghetto pushin through, but I'ma do it right.
Never buckle, never stop to struggle!
Layzie gotta muscle through the pressure, bust pipes, my life, highlights, bright lights, all right! Story of a warrior. My flight, final destination, thug motivation, time never wastin, pacin my stride.

Tryin to get it good! Feel the hustle and flow.
You know we are them mighty soldiers.
Had it been for all the shit we been through and doin whatever but God surely knows.

Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around

Everytime I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin' on a bad plan
Tryin' to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin' a thugsta

At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time

There's always somebody talkin' 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggas ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine

Everytime I turn around there's somebody straight trippin'
Hatin' on a mission, fakin' on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
Like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out

Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Everytime that I turn around
Somebody all up in my business

Actin' like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
Knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him

Everytime I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggas never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin' niggaz was weak but we showed 'em

We on top it ain't no stoppin' us, the suckas wishin' we would go away
So they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin' 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray
Kray, take action, Jackson

Everytime that I turn around
I'm duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Everytime that I turn around
Duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Everytime I turn around somebody doin' somethin' foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin' to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize but the clock
Is sayin' time don't wait for nothin', it don't stop

Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it
Like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop but y'all lucky
Eastside, front to back, we guard that
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat?

Heyyy, wooo, ooooh
Hey yeah, ooh now

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
If I had one wish, that wish would be clear
That I would not have to go, that I could stay here
And although it hurts me, to leave you all alone
Just know I'll come back to you, for now I am gone

For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gooooooooooooooone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)
For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gooooooooooooooone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)

When I'm dead and gone don't even worry
Don't mourn me too long, death'll get you discouraged
Keepin your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin
I know it for certain if I'm really restin in heaven
No need for you to fear, don't cry
Cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives
So I'ma be comin, be ready for the next shine
Cause I'm a believer that I'll see a resurrection
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin, no drippin, no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in piece 'til I prevail
It's just a temporary lay down, I won't forever stay down
So keep me in your memory, don't let me fade out
I'll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong, I'm gone gone, long gone

Picking me up when I'm flat on the ground
Lifting me up through the dirt that I found
Taking me well beyond leaps and bounds
Sold to the mound? soul to the clown
Little window

It don't get no better when I get a little Henny kinfolk some Indo
Dead in my tracks like Kimbo, slam back another 6'4
Sip slow, got? on my mind, flipping I'm fine
Back to that ghetto smhetto
Back to the basics back to the missions

I'm second to none, seconds to win
Seconds to run
First to lose it, worst to come
Sippin on booze
Forever young
That's real talk, come at you young
You can hear my real heart

Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Oh what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold
We living our lives to eternal our soul aye-oh-aye-oh

Prayyyyyyy, and we pray and we pray, and we pray, and we pray

Still we laced, now follow me roll stroll
Whether is tell of his Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone

Every time I, turn arouuuund Every time I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin on a bad plan
Tryin to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin a Thugsta
At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time
There's always somebody talkin 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggaz ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine
Every time I turn around there's somebody straight trippin
Hatin on a mission, fakin on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out
Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Every time that I turn arouuuund
Somebody all up in my business
Actin like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him
Every time I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggaz never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin niggaz was weak but we showed 'em
We on top it ain't no stoppin us, the suckas wishin we would go away
so they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray
Kray "Take Action" Jackson

Every time that I turn arouuuuund
I'm duckin haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere
Every time that I turn arouuuuund
Duckin haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Every time I turn around somebody doin somethin foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize, but the clock
is sayin time don't wait for nothin, it don't stop
Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it
Like pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, but y'all lucky
Eastside, front to back, we guard that
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat
Yeah nigga all that, we livin in a cruel world
It's rough in the ghetto but we put family first
When friends turn to foes and the enemy's exposed
That's when you gotta move on and kick dirt

Hear me u know I hear you, I feel you heavenly father
Time goes time flows, real water
Well baby just shine for me, send a bunch of angels to your rescue
(E the elo hinds?) it's him trough the sins
Never dismiss you, god is the realest love that I've lorded
I came back from a walk like (daddyyyyyy) u will be known
U will be owed to the ozone layer
Could u take me to the strip club, my cup, cause baby u a player
U tell em that I love em, n I need em, let's stick together
When hell tries to break the love, say a prayer
Making it better
In or out of, this is the way that we talk
This is the way that we walk
Baby war that I got

I give her that thug love for doing my stuff
Girl, everything 100
I'ma keep it 100
Everything 100, everything 100, everything 100

You know I keep it true to my brain
Girl, I always stay one in me, I kept it real for 20 years, I ain't changed
Be careful when you cruising in my lane
Watch me creep out through your rearview as I gas right past these lames
We did it how we did it ‘cause we did it for the money
Living on, living this, you really, really love this
You want a thug nigga like me
Yeah, you know they all love niggas like me

She ain't complaining mainly ‘cause everything I do is entertaining
hangin swagin body banging, she in trainin, to be famous
Yeah, she speak the language, baby know just where the lane is
She with me, she'd never named the stranger, know we are armed & dangerous
This ain't your deal, this still the thugs shit but this for them playas

Heyyy, wooo, ooooh
Hey yeah, ooh now

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
If I had one wish, that wish would be clear
That I would not have to go, that I could stay here
And although it hurts me, to leave you all alone
Just know I'll come back to you, for now I am gone

[Interlude: Krayzie Bone (Ricco Barrino)]
For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gooooooooooooooone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)
For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gooooooooooooooone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)

[Krayzie Bone]
When I'm dead and gone don't even worry
Don't mourn me too long, death'll get you discouraged
Keepin your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin
I know it for certain if I'm really restin in heaven
No need for you to fear, don't cry
Cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives
So I'ma be comin, be ready for the next shine
Cause I'm a believer that I'll see a resurrection
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin, no drippin, no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in piece 'til I prevail
It's just a temporary lay down, I won't forever stay down
So keep me in your memory, don't let me fade out
I'll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong, I'm gone gone, long gone

You'll never find a thuggish bunch of niggas like us
Don't be so quick to test us I'll be annoyed and might bust
I'ma have to talk to Eazy through the ouija, so I can see
If maybe he can tell me why you hatin' on me
Bitin' on me, why you want me
To show a nigga leatherface in me
Don't fuck around nigga he's a real buck 'em down nigga
Motherfuck rappin' how bout fuckin' with me now nigga
Niggas get your checks from your broads get high
Then your broads sneak your keys from your niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party even the niggas with a problem
Hey nigga we can solve em, 'cause bitch we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all Mo T.
See me rappin' on your tv actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person think we gon' flex or show you
no action
Down for mine, gotta show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I feel with so much anger and pain
And if I drop then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm time to ring the alarm
Break the niggas out of prison killin' all the guards, woo!
Power to the people givin' people the power to put it down in your city
And fuck them hillbillies
Nigga I can't stand no mothafuckin' po-po
When will we start killin' these bitches and takin' no more
Mo thug the only clique that I claim
Although we all beyond the bangin'
You could say I roll with a gang
And then some chin checkers in the makin'

Oh, well, if ya snooze ya loose
Stop bringin' that pistol and fetch ya
Shoot it and catch ya, shit, pap
Stay packin' that gat in yo lap away

So if ya can't roll strapped
Now how about that
Dat pistol go tap at niggas, who
Go fuckin' wit one of my own

No no, wrong, any place where my chrome
Left devils at they home
Double bang, execution, we mo murda, stupid trick
You, bitch that asked me

We don't play wit me game that be remainin' mine and little man ran
To disaster, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began

But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggaz thugin' off in the Claire
It's still the pen
Can't fuck wit these Cleveland Claire, playas

So as long as ya betta be workin'
'Cause the Bone and mo' thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way hoe

Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna separate from the previous, baby
Or maybe
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
And God's name, I pray

The devil, he be bringin' me down
I can feel him 'cause he pullin' me now
I've been blessed wit an incredible style
When there's pushin', it's just try to separate
And to break this all down, now ain't that foul

So I asked the Lord to help me
Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?
When we livin' in hell
But we chill most every day like we in heaven

Oh, well
But time will tell
Singin, "This is for the ringin' of the bell, the bell, the bell"
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful

If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you
Defeat you, deceive you, evil
He will never leave you alone
I've been lookin' for a better day

But they don't ever seem to want to come, my way

Yeah, this for all you non-believers, especially out in the C-O. Man,

Nigga, this Mo Thug and we can get fucked-up even if I'm under
surveillance, I watch out, wanna win, and fuck 'em up daily, throwin' up

this will get crazy and blow .

Got your mind blown, vocal tones keep it sewn, blastin' out your steroes
or your headphones. The roots exploited clones; therefore, it's my job to
describe the loudness, the habitat of rap survival kit. Artistic skin
abrasion, so when 'em fadin' my worldly reflections, it's magnified to
new levels of elevation.

Seven sign, seven, seven sign, seven, seventh sign seal.
Yeah, now y'all know, yeah.
Yeah, I'm (tatted) so when I die, you can see what's deep in my eye .

Yeah, got my niggas from St. Clair up in this muthafucka, nigga

Fin to put this shit down like this, nigga
(We off to the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

What if we slowed it down?
Then, nigga, you would hear me
I know niggas would fuck around
And say we tried to steal your style

Come on to funky town, that's where we gets the rawest
Thuggish ruggish Bone, so sho' nuff, that's what they call us
My niggas is older, now, so they know when to unload
So, when them funky, funky jump me

Gon' be ready to roll
(Ready to roll)
It's part of no static, see, we just out to get paid
But, oh no, niggas heard the flow
And wanted a piece of the cake

It kinda pissed me off that [unverified] figured they could get skills
But when kept on disrespectin'
Make 'em think we shit's real, nigga
I'm from the Land where every niggas plan

And schemin' for the money, man, so we packin'
And they don't understand them niggas rappin'
But still they actin' like criminals
[Unverified] reciprocal

They don't know it, even though
Oh, no, no, can't let you go
When I pop, pop, pop
(Pop, pop)

That funk 'll gon' blow you away
Playa hation strikes a nerve everyday
Oh, gotta say, fuck all, y'all, all y'all
Wasteland warriors, we stressed, we stressed, we stressed

Warriors ride
(Bloody murder, bloody mo' murder)
(Murder, murder, murder, play, play)
Wasteland warriors ride
(Bloody murder, bloody mo' murder)

And these Mo Thug roll the sword from the front and back

1: Bizzy Bone
I'm sending a message to warn you imposters
All hating in my business
When I see you I'm a drop you
Get slugged and get drugged
My niggas I'll hustle to pay the judge
Got you when I spot you I should pop you
Even the boss was telling me not to
But I won't stop until they get shot
When they get out the hospital
They gonna get shot, too
The fast one bringing that AK
Better walk, then we even
When I leave and flees to Cleveland
Now, murder 'em and rest in peace
So goodbye. We're shutting it down
And now we're prowling niggas from alleys
Cloning our sound, we found your town
Now is you ready for the war?
Cry loud and go
Many if all niggas 'll fall off in they sleep
And even oppose and order them hoes
Gonna flee with me?
Bitch, fuck with me then see that
My little aliens, yeah
We come to your city. Can they really
Put it on down with the pistol?
Can you feel me, feel me?

2: Layzie Bone
They beat biters, dope-style takers
When I see you face-to-face
My nigga, I'm a treat you like a hater
You niggas ain't Bone, you clone
You wrong. What the fuck?
You niggas ain't thinking
What's the consequence?
Now I'm 'bout to get
Real deadly. Ready for the war
When we just start bombing shit
Trying to cop my click?
Hell no! Real raw. Y'all niggas thought this was a game?
Now it's time to make you feel the pain
Wanna test my everyday thang?
I aim straight for your temple
It's really that simple when I seen it splatter
Had I even killed one of you clones
Then the rest of y'all wouldn't even matter
Scattered. Run for the border
Your career is getting shorter
Nigga, better hide 'cause I already warned ya

Better not be so quick test us,
'cause we'll come to kill ya, now.
We'll kill ya, now.
Aw, triple-platinum, nigga, digga, and still thuggin' with the roughest muthafuckas in my city, and a nigga wonder, "
How they still chillin' like that?
Ain't you scared of a nigga that's tryin' to jack ya paper, snatch ya?" No.
I really wish a nigga would turn and wanna take what's mine, 'cause I got an AK-47 shootin' trey-O times.
You didn't think I'm willing to find a way to say, "
Oh, my!" but check it out, though.
I done made enough money to buy my ghetto a lot of weapons, y'all.
And I made it, takin' out my weed.
Here, stay high, nigga, so paranoia is factor when a nigga wanna act up.
Nigga figure I'm quiet, then he 1ook at my sawed-offs, and they figure they can try me, like a muthafucka won't swang back or somethin', or even pull a nine out my jacket, and start dumpin'.
Fuck 'em.
I think a nigga see us on the video and playa hate and say that we ain't true to what we say, but, then again, when you see us on the street and playa hate, we bang them fuckin' brains .
But then, we switch subject, and fuck with them clones that suck the thug dick.
Run around foul, tellin' people we stole your style.
Muthafucka, we ain't never been in your town.
It's all original when it's comin' from the Cleveland criminals, so here we go.
Got a gun--should I buck 'em on down?
Or should I kill 'em when I put the instrumental on?
Why they wanna sound like Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh?
I'm so full anguish.
Gotta style so cold everybody and their mama wanna claim it, but they can't get the hang of it.
Yeah.

Coffins open, dump 'em all in

You're feelin' me kill 'em, 'cause I go with plenty artillery
Come and get showed, there'll be gauges and uzis
Let us begin with bullets
Can't none of ya break off a niggas from prison
And let 'em come with us - retaliation
We come and blast 'em with leather masks on
Let loose

You need beware when your rollin' down the Clair
These niggas is killas, try to feel us
Thuggish ruggish niggas from Cleveland
We steadily creepin' on ya
And you better believe that we bring that pap-pap to your doorstep
Ho-check, you don't wanna fuck with Bone
Let loose

Nigga, bulletproof, if a muthafucka pull it
Then he better shoot
Nigga never no 9-1-1 to your rescue
Never repsect you, blowin' your chest through
Labelled as a menace, but I'm feelin' it again
And I'm in it to the finish, better check my manuscript
Killa, for realer, drugdealer, little nigga, cap peeler
Bailin' through the Land equipped
When I grips the grip, pump, shot it, shot it

It's East 1999 time

I promise that I'll hunt you bastards
Zip 'em in casket, here to get drastic, fast in a hurry
Is you ready for me magic?
Let 'em blast, and nigga, better burn
Then move, true to the murder mo, gladly
'Cause the haters never had to have me
Want to follow fools through alleys
'Cause ready to lose and daddy
who raised me like Layzie, Krayzie
Probably St. Clair babies, so hate me
But I handle my business
So lately I can handle my shady
Kill 'em, but we think I'm a bomb again
No leavin' as they put me in prison and give me time
I'm ready for the gun to go get'em
And I'm a fill 'em with eleven of mine and one die
Is he ready to lie if I decide
Lookin' at my killin's in his eyes and boom to go bye
I'm gonna fly (fly)
Whom die they lie

Whom die they lie

No mo' mercy

Whom die they lie (Shot)

Now, who want to go snitch?
Talk shit about real trues, still be payin' dues
Saw them sneakin'
And a nigga gettin' sick of all the players, they hatin'
Why so many fakers runnin' they mouth about shit and they lose
Lookin' so deep eyes, and tell it when they lyin'
Stop tryin', but they never convince none
Got hundreds runnin' up with gauges
Still I'm sure they sure they fryin' us, but I buck
Sometimes I save it, for me kill 'em off late at night
So, what if it got too late for me to get 'em?
Then gotta switch to testin' G's
In this game I aim to keep away from every crazy steady
we're too quick to pull petty bullshit

Quickly the reaper peep you
Sweep you off your feet in Cleveland

Grab a shot of liquor and pop pop popped it in my mouth
An' I'm thinking to my self that this might be a waste of my time,
'cause what if I don't even get high
Thirty minutes dun came by, I didn't even seem high,
until I stood up and looked at the ceiling for some reason
Now I'm tweaking, then I tried to walk but I was slow
I guess I'm floating in ecstasy (just like the nigga told me)

I fell so realish realish realish, 'cause we floating in ecstasy
I fell so realish realish realish, 'cause we floating in ecstasy
I fell so realish realish realish, 'cause we floating in ecstasy

We in the last five days of these trials and tribulations
And I'm waiting for the Lord oh please don't leave me forsaken
Caught up in the doom prepare for Satan
We facing a situation while I'm drunk and scared
Heavily sedated wonder will I make it to the pearly gates
Or will I burn off in that lake now,
Could you feel the earthquake shaking the dead awake
How many wait it's too late it's over now
Niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable,
Having a little trouble a day wid ah fiend or somethin'
Betta plead to bloody Jesus
Watch how the majesty control it
Don't let it go slow down hold on
Now can I get a witness shout Hallelujah, Amen
I'm feeling the Holy Ghost makin' moves through ya
Smooth, I made it to free your mind to the rhythm
I got designed when the world drop dimes
This world you'll fine there's no other like my kind

If the world should end today!
Fully automatic gunning through it
Gunning thangs, red rummed when strumming pain
Mo murda, I heard 'em holla holla, clock dollas
Swallow me baby cause we balling hollow point tips to the CI
Enemies keep rolling, get 'em off that flaunted fluid
Making me nauseous cautious these niggas is flossing
My Nina Ross tossed out I'm slaucing
It's for the auction rapper bop the copper got gospel on 'em
Who wanna magnum?
Who wanna tag 'em?
Bag 'em up ain't no problem, baby(bitch)
Smoked out in high school
Sleeping the fifth grade selling chicken

Boy boy don't fuck around and get me paranoid

Unstoppable relentless rolling in Benzes

Proceed wid the lead and completed it's on
Feel my bombs motherfucker, undisputed round for round
Putting it down, town ta town tearing da roof of this mother-fucker
When I'm in your city get wit me fuck wit your nigga
When I'm in Maui hoes around me still come fuck wid your niggas

While I'm in the county I can die
Flipped up my style-y as we came at the same time
Baby tempted, in the tension
Ouija shit got you demented
Crash the Benz and ending your sentence
Born for criminal defendants
Critical breaking in the ghetto bar thinking
Millenium shit like pestilence war and famine
Animals move animals reputed
Every daily grades let it be the reason
My Cleveland niggas revolve like dead bodies
In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump
But I doubt it if I have ta pop the trunk
I'ma get 'em when they thinking they miss me what
Nigga that thuggish ruggish fuck them up
Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit
All of my dogs all of we lie
Nigga you touched and stuck on murda
Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts

Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me

There's always something you got to give up (Yeah, I know)
If you want everything you want (But shit I don't know, I don't know)

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely - so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend
But I predicted this endin, back in the day
Cuz I had visions of bad decisions knew niggaz would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still wanna make the loot
No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain;
just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail - you play 'em wrong then you fail
It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved - everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw
And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We split up, we tied up, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin the devil get in, to the pen
Devils pretendin to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass
Should of stuck the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

There's always something you got to give up.
If you want everything you want.

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died
all of my niggaz came to the church
And thanks for comin, I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin

You got to keep your mind on money (T-H-U-G)
Don't let the snakes ever short you for ya change
Nigga, let 'em know how much you want it

(Krayzie)
Nigga 1993, hooked up with Eazy E
1994, rushin through the door with the Bone flow
Nigga was creepin on a come up, doin it for the love of money
1995 we really let 'em know, Cleveland is the city where we come from
Brought styles muthafuckas never heard before
But we never got our props
'til we dropped that said song, see you at the crossroad
But the man know, Eazy runnin with the lost souls, rest in peace
That was 1996, we back in the mix
I guess they thought that we'd gon' quit but we got love for this shit
But everything started changin, business rearangin
Then the time when Bone and Ruthless wasn't vibin
Tried to keep my mind together through that industry shit
Somehow I'm feelin like what I deserve I didn't get
But I'ma stick it out, believe I'ma keep my head up
And show my loyalty for Eazy E, even though I'm fed up
1997 hey, everybody grab ya weapon, its the art of war
It don't stop, it won't stop until we drop, body rott
Not to mention when we venture through the family scriptures
1999 nigga, still strugglin
Tryna get some money with this mastermind I'm jugglin
Sharpen up ya thug mentality
And by the year 2000 I'll be thuggin, but so I'm???
I gotta get some money, blast if I get hungry
So if you read that I done flipped, then you know the story, about me

Could you tell me where you run to

When it ain't nowhere to turn to

Could you tell me where you run to

Verse 1: Layzie Bone

I'm stuck in this penetentiary called life
Deciphering wrong from right
Dodging these institutions these niggas shooting
Puttin' the oldest far from life,
Facing a brick wall at a stand still
Was it a dream or was it reality
Now it's a nightmare hunting my sanity
Thank the Lord up in heaven ain't mad at me
It's sad to see I be bustin' my ass
I'm down for my grind getting nowhere fast
I'ma thug so you know ah nigga built to last
To the point ah no return tryna' get the cash
Feel mo' wrath, murda on the government
War for the niggas on the streets
It'll be no peace till the top dog eat
Tryna' stop my meal you can catch this steel
6 feet deep is where you be layin'
Worms and maggots is where you be stayin'
Deaperado 2000 all about the money murda 'n mayhem
I look at the niggas I went to school wid
Shot pool wid was always cool wid
Same niggas I just can't fool wid
Niggas got guns and ready to use it
So I'm trapped up against the wall
Watchin' y'all niggas plottin' on me
Tryin' ah catch me up in that robbery
Put they mob on me and do ah job on me
But I'm proud to be that nigga in the ghetto that just can't stay out
Ain't nowhere to run ain't nowhere to hide
And it ain't no way out

[Flesh N Bone & Bizzy Bone]

Could you tell where you run to
[When you duckin' the po-po dodging these killas]
[And leaving yo family at yo people dog]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When you stuck shit outta luck
[And ain't got no hustle to make that buck dog]
Could you tell me where you run to
[When the road you on is a dead end left wid borrowing and begging]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When all this music shit play out and you trapped wid no way out]

All hating in my business
When I see you I'm a drop you
Get slugged and get drugged
My niggas I'll hustle to pay the judge
Got you when I spot you I should pop you
Even the boss was telling me not to
But I won't stop until they get shot
When they get out the hospital
They gonna get shot, too
The fast one bringing that AK
Better walk, then we even
When I leave and flees to Cleveland
Now, murder 'em and rest in peace
So goodbye. We're shutting it down
And now we're prowling niggas from alleys
Cloning our sound, we found your town
Now is you ready for the war?
Cry loud and go
Many if all niggas 'll fall off in they sleep
And even oppose and order them hoes
Gonna flee with me?
Bitch, fuck with me then see that

Better not be so quick test us,
'cause we'll come to kill ya, now.
We'll kill ya, now.
Aw, triple-platinum, nigga, digga, and still thuggin' with the roughest muthafuckas in my city, and a nigga wonder, "
How they still chillin' like that?
Ain't you scared of a nigga that's tryin' to jack ya paper, snatch ya?" No.
I really wish a nigga would turn and wanna take what's mine, 'cause I got an AK-47 shootin' trey-O times.
You didn't think I'm willing to find a way to say, "
Oh, my!" but check it out, though.
I done made enough money to buy my ghetto a lot of weapons, y'all.
And I made it, takin' out my weed.
Here, stay high, nigga, so paranoia is factor when a nigga wanna act up.
Nigga figure I'm quiet, then he 1ook at my sawed-offs, and they figure they can try me, like a muthafucka won't swang back or somethin', or even pull a nine out my jacket, and start dumpin'.
Fuck 'em.
I think a nigga see us on the video and playa hate and say that we ain't true to what we say, but, then again, when you see us on the street and playa hate, we bang them fuckin' brains .
But then, we switch subject, and fuck with them clones that suck the thug dick.
Run around foul, tellin' people we stole your style.
Muthafucka, we ain't never been in your town.
It's all original when it's comin' from the Cleveland criminals, so here we go.
Got a gun--should I buck 'em on down?
Or should I kill 'em when I put the instrumental on?
Why they wanna sound like Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh?
I'm so full anguish.
Gotta style so cold everybody and their mama wanna claim it, but they can't get the hang of it.
Yeah.

Fuck 'em, let the law end
'Cause we simply get the raw end
Coffins open, dump 'em all in

Nine millimeters, three-eighty's
You're feelin' me kill 'em, 'cause I go with plenty artillery
Come and get showed, there'll be gauges and uzis
Let us begin with bullets
Can't none of ya break off a niggas from prison
And let 'em come with us - retaliation
We come and blast 'em with leather masks on
Let loose

You need beware when your rollin' down the Clair
These niggas is killas, try to feel us
Thuggish ruggish niggas from Cleveland
We steadily creepin' on ya
And you better believe that we bring that pap-pap to your doorstep
Ho-check, you don't wanna fuck with Bone
Let loose

Nigga, bulletproof, if a muthafucka pull it
Then he better shoot
Nigga never no 9-1-1 to your rescue
Never repsect you, blowin' your chest through
Labelled as a menace, but I'm feelin' it again
And I'm in it to the finish, better check my manuscript
Killa, for realer, drugdealer, little nigga, cap peeler
Bailin' through the Land equipped
When I grips the grip, pump, shot it, shot it

It's East 1999 time

I promise that I'll hunt you bastards
Zip 'em in casket, here to get drastic, fast in a hurry
Is you ready for me magic?
Let 'em blast, and nigga, better burn
Then move, true to the murder mo, gladly
'Cause the haters never had to have me
Want to follow fools through alleys
'Cause ready to lose and daddy
who raised me like Layzie, Krayzie
Probably St. Clair babies, so hate me
But I handle my business
So lately I can handle my shady
Kill 'em, but we think I'm a bomb again
No leavin' as they put me in prison and give me time
I'm ready for the gun to go get'em
And I'm a fill 'em with eleven of mine and one die
Is he ready to lie if I decide
Lookin' at my killin's in his eyes and boom to go bye
I'm gonna fly (fly)
Whom die they lie

Whom die they lie

No mo' mercy

Whom die they lie (Shot)

Now, who want to go snitch?
Talk shit about real trues, still be payin' dues
Saw them sneakin'
And a nigga gettin' sick of all the players, they hatin'
Why so many fakers runnin' they mouth about shit and they lose
Lookin' so deep eyes, and tell it when they lyin'
Stop tryin', but they never convince none
Got hundreds runnin' up with gauges
Still I'm sure they sure they fryin' us, but I buck
Sometimes I save it, for me kill 'em off late at night
So, what if it got too late for me to get 'em?
Then gotta switch to testin' G's
In this game I aim to keep away from every crazy steady
we're too quick to pull petty bullshit

So to all you bustas out there, beware

So it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen and I'm low on ends, fuck calm

I tried to stay thug, got flowin' skills but nigga
They bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the 44 Mag' plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag can't reveal when I glide
With the moneybag

Ride to the hide', count my flags
I be livin' on the dark side and I can't escape
Some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is
If I play with my gauge

It's a raid, put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets
Watches, jewels and you'll be safe

I snatched the clerk up by her neck
Put the gun in her mouth and said
"Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
If you wanna be killed try some stupid shit"

And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
L locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail, well, tickets
I'm out the door, hopped in the smug and I break fast

Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, locked out
As I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight, covered my tracks

Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine and if you stall then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid, I'll rob you
See a nigga creep on ah come up

Bout to hit this corner, livin' like a thug on the real
Who's stronger when I put it on ya, on ya, all playa haters goners

Murder, mo murder, mo murder, mo murder them all
They fall, they fall buck buck, oh yeah
Niggas they get it then pissed off
And ah, and ah to fuck with the wrong motherfuckers
They fall (quick) when we buck, bitch, ooh
We got something to put you back into your truck quick
Hey, that four-four magnum, gon' handle em'
Ain't no nigga badder, .357 put that ass on the mat
Execution, I'll be shootin' while you runnin' off at your mouth
You plot me cause you watch me, watch me, watch me
My nigga, we know what ya thinkin'

I'm comin' up outta my shit with some shit
That be keepin' you runnin' and wonderin'

Bone, Bone, Bone
Wasteland soldiers
These are the days of our lives (of our lives, of our lives)

I've been strugglin', hustlin', thuggin' it forever
Come and look deeply in my eyes (with Layzie: my eyes)
I've been strugglin', hustlin', thuggin' it forever, and ever

Bone, Bone, Bone
We gotta prepare, gotta prepare, gotta prepare for eternal warfare

Only time will tell who dies
These are the days of our lives
(Layzie: Only time will tell)
Come look deeply in my eyes
These are the days of our lives
See the murder mold our lives
(Layzie: See the murder mold)
These are the days of our lives
(Layzie: These are the days of our lives)
These are the days of our lives

Now come into my world, and you can see that we are more than thugs
(with Layzie: We're more than thugs, we're more than thugs, we're more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, we're smokin' lethal warriors
(with Layzie: We're warriors, we're warriors, we're warriors)

Now come into my world, and you can see that we are more than thugs

With just a little twist of harmony, we're smokin' lethal warriors
(with Layzie: We're warriors, we're warriors, we're warriors)

Eternal your thugs, here I come, tellin' 'em soldier stories
Been daily collectin' my lesson, went out on a quest and without any question, stressin', no restin', we journey
This blessin' shiftin' the game, rearrangin' thangs, 'cause most the world was bringin' me down
Mesmerized, controlled by the other side, and the devil was in my town, looking for me

But he won't get me in time, fuckin with Bone, and he's likin' these rhymes
We rhyme, better believe, it's all the time, nigga, we 'live

Break break down
Steady breakin' me on down
Break break down
Steady breakin' me on down

Break break down
Steady breakin' me on down
Break break down
Steady breakin' me on down

You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love

Immediately, I pretended to be
Feeling similarily
And led to believe, I was okay
To just walk away
From the one thing that's unyielding
And sacred to me
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalaunt about it
And I'm going to extremes, to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly loosing my mind
Underneath a guise of a smile, gradually I'm dying inside

Friends ask me how I feel, and I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal, the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise, till I go home at night
And turn down the lights and then I breakdown and cry (cry cry cry)
So what do you do, when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain and rejection it's putting you through

Do you cling to your pride
And sing "I Will Survive" (get control hold on, hold on)
Do you lash out and say (hold on, got to get control)

Eazy-E:
Black nigga killa, killa, killa, killa

Eazy-E:
Black nigga killa. Hate brought death around the block as a hollow point bust through the punk's back. Raisin' Cain, feel no
pain as I penetrate. Nigga five deep as I strike at a quick pace. I got the evil of my dead nigga trapped in my mind so my soul
is a threat to all mankind. Born to kill, I'm wicked by nature, 'cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hellraisers. A
30.06 with the scope I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast. Muthaf**kas catchin' heat as I bring anger, and
release more danger from my chamber. The evil in my blood is possessed, so I creep low from the back slow and push lead
through that nigga's flesh. Ain't no hope when every nigga wants to be the nine-milla, on the trigger, the black nigga killa.

Krayzie:
We be the mighty warrior. Black nigga killa, what's up? You ready to die? You think you can f**k with them thug niggas?
Come on, tell me the truth, nigga. Look in my eyes. Bitch, we get live. Bone thugs-n-harmony, nigga--Cleveland's thuggish
ruggish niggas still down with the thug shit. Buck, buck, bust. Let 'em know we still run this bitch just like an assassin. Say,
nigga, we nice but can get nasty. Get into war, what else can it be? Nigga, you know what we came here for. You know,
when we shot through the door, my niggas was serious, playin no jokes. Just 'cause I'm a rapper, you thought it's for show?
Okay nigga let's see if this a real fo'-fo'. You thought we was studio, saw us on video, seen us in person so here we go [here
we go]. What is your problem? Here come the bullets, better dodge 'em. I sneaks up behind, so I'm f**kin' with killas.

No! Why my nigga took a fall?
Saw my nigga try to swing them dums, (in the war) so we lost him
But, damn, why did ya have to kill 'um?
I never did think it'd be one of my trues to get caught up in redrum
I sit and I pray everyday: God, don't let me get smoked
Oh no, a nigga ain't scared to go, but I still got a lot to live for

I'ma have to talk to Eazy through the ouija, so I can see
If maybe he can tell me why you hatin' on me
Bitin' on me, why you want me

Don't fuck around nigga he's a real buck 'em down nigga
Motherfuck rappin' how bout fuckin' with me now nigga

Then your broads sneak your keys from your niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party even the niggas with a problem
Hey nigga we can solve em, 'cause bitch we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all Mo T.
See me rappin' on your tv actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person think we gon' flex or show you
no action
Down for mine, gotta show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I feel with so much anger and pain
And if I drop then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm time to ring the alarm
Break the niggas out of prison killin' all the guards, woo!
Power to the people givin' people the power to put it down in your city
And fuck them hillbillies

When will we start killin' these bitches and takin' no more
Mo thug the only clique that I claim
Although we all beyond the bangin'

Yo, fuck the police, comin' straight from the underground.
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown and not the other color.
Some police think they have the authority to kill a minority,
but muthafucka mad, 'cause I ain't the one for a punk muthafucka
with a badge and a gun to be beatin' on and thrown in jail. But we
can go toe to toe in the middle of the cell. Fuckin' with a
nigga, 'cause a nigga turned major, and got a little bit of money
and they play us, search a nigga car, lookin' for a product,
thinkin' every thug nigga sellin' narcotics. They'd rather see
me in the pen, than me blowin' indo rollin' in my Benz-o. I send the
police to the grave, and when I'm finished, nigga, bring the
yellow tape to tape off the scene of the slaughter, still gettin' swoll
off bread and water. I don't know if they fags or what--search a nigga
down and grab on his nuts. And on the other hand, without
a gun they can't get none, but don't let it be a black and a white one,
'cause they'll slam ya down to the street top. Black police
showin' out for the white cop, but Krayzie Bone will swarm on

Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Could you tell me what you see?
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago.
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit.
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, and don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy.
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that, but a y'all fin to get stomped.

It's all mo thug, it's all mo', mo' thug
It's all mo thug, it's all mo', mo' thug

Oh, well, if ya snooze ya loose
Stop bringin' that pistol and fetch ya
Shoot it and catch ya, shit, pap
Stay packin' that gat in yo lap away

So if ya can't roll strapped
Now how about that
Dat pistol go tap at niggas, who
Go fuckin' wit one of my own

No no, wrong, any place where my chrome
Left devils at they home
Double bang, execution, we mo murda, stupid trick
You, bitch that asked me

We don't play wit me game that be remainin' mine and little man ran
To disaster, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began

But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggaz thugin' off in the Claire
It's still the pen
Can't fuck wit these Cleveland Claire, playas

So as long as ya betta be workin'
'Cause the Bone and mo' thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way hoe

Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna separate from the previous, baby
Or maybe
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
And God's name, I pray

The devil, he be bringin' me down
I can feel him 'cause he pullin' me now
I've been blessed wit an incredible style
When there's pushin', it's just try to separate
And to break this all down, now ain't that foul

So I asked the Lord to help me
Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?
When we livin' in hell
But we chill most every day like we in heaven

Oh, well
But time will tell
Singin, "This is for the ringin' of the bell, the bell, the bell"
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful

If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you
Defeat you, deceive you, evil
He will never leave you alone
I've been lookin' for a better day

But they don't ever seem to want to come, my way

Gotta have another bill, y'all Dog, I need all my change

Better act like yo know I'm rolling with Mo posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs we must doin our best to obey god violent in these times

Do or die, (that died to Boo--he go bye) whom die they lie in the face of our society.
Try at of every attempt to quiet me, I got a nation that's down to ride with me.
Here's the deal, can I get a witness?
It's deeper than survival.
Who am I?
My brother's keeper?
Yeah, I be clutchin' on my Bible, willing to die.
The wicked is near me, dearly departed, but nobody hears me.
Is we all gon' fall in misery?
It's so serious, it bring tears to me.
Ears to the street, like a drum to the beat, creepin' up my block.
I'm already knowin' a nigga wanna do me, so I stay strapped. (Don't pose for the cop), crooked cops, they gonna harass me, ask me the same ol' bullshit questions, knowin' I'm a thug with bud for days, keepin'
a pistol in my possession, but a thuggish ruggish soldier like myself gon' move on, and prevail, avoid jail, collect my mill with my Bones, splittin' domes.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, don't make me hurt ya.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, all about that bloody murder.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, make a move and I'll have to hurt ya.

And do away with all of the wicked shit like Mr. Police-man
And dog if you with it then pump ya fist in tha air
And pray for the politicians freely; get a amen?

Thats why I get high, that's why I get high

But nobody knows when it all unfolds
Then when I don't go
Remember the days cause all I got

If you want everything you want
(But shit I don't know, I don't know)

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely, so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend

But I predicted this endin', back in the day
'Cause I had visions of bad decisions knew niggaz would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still wanna make the loot

No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail, you play 'em wrong then you fail

It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
'Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw

And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We split up, we tied up, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin' the devil get in, to the pen, devils pretendin' to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass

Should of stuck the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin' snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died all of my niggaz came to the church

And thanks for comin', I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin'
But I'm still rappin' get it all off my chest

So I came back to the action

You better count your money x7
Ghetto cowboy
The name is Krayzie "
Big Bad Ass" Bone, wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, along with some cash, even took the mayor's daughter.
Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it, so I brought her.
Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble, double-crossed by the law, so there's nobody to run to: yeah,
it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun.
Outlaw--call him Leather Face.
I'm headed for the West, heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet.
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown.
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown.
So, I continue my mission.
It's gettin' dark, so I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns--they like to catch ya, then they
rob and split.
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool,
protectin' my chips.
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes.
Stop my horse. "
Whoa, Nellie!
Who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out."
Who is this?
I hope this ain't the law.
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun.
C'mon out, right now.
I'm gettin' angry." Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot.
It's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer."

The Ghetto would always gon' hold me down
Picking me up when I'm flat on the ground
Lifting me up through the dirt that I found

Taking me well beyond leaps and bounds
Sold to the mound? soul to the clown
Little window

It don't get no better when I get a little Henny kinfolk some Indo
Dead in my tracks like Kimbo, slam back another 6'4

Sip slow, got? on my mind, flipping I'm fine
Back to that ghetto smhetto
Back to the basics back to the missions
My niggas no kidding I get on this plane and I'm going insane and I'm sharing my rhythm been working on second winds
I'm second to none, seconds to win
Seconds to run
First to lose it, worst to come
Sippin on booze
Forever young
That's real talk, come at you young
You can hear my real heart
It's real dark
Back where I'm from
That's cause they'll kill ya
Mamma told me get money but don't be no dummy but she was so caught up I thought I was nothing I'm probably something method is complex

Somebody's schemin on a bad plan
Tryin to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin a Thugsta
At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time
There's always somebody talkin 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggaz ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine
Every time I turn around there's somebody straight trippin
Hatin on a mission, fakin on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out
Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Every time that I turn arouuuund
Somebody all up in my business
Actin like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him
Every time I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggaz never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin niggaz was weak but we showed 'em
We on top it ain't no stoppin us, the suckas wishin we would go away
so they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray

I can't turn my back without these haters tryin to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize, but the clock

Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it

Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat

There they go, take the shot!

When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme
And I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do?
You ain't knowin that I'm comin to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit'cha
With a little bit of killa
Better know that you can never-never
See me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP
I will never STOP
When a nigga POP
See the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang
Bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit
Motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action
See the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him
How a nigga smash 'em
See the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY!
Now you gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a get'cha gimmick
And I hope a lot of niggas live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me
Cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin you the final chapter
With a lot of laughter
See the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that the beat up in the buildin
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children

Goin' through the struggles every day on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same
There's a lot of haters that don't want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me (forget me)
So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh
So that you'll never forget me (forget me)
So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh

When I'm dead and gone
They gon' remember me as bein' one of the livest
Genuine ghetto survivors, when they think terror
Inside I pop in they mind, a silent killer
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
With lyrics more potent than a viper's venom
One bite could kill 'em
When I get in 'em niggas never knew what'd hit 'em
Legends, for what we done did on the streets
And what we done spit on these records
Blessings, we take 'em and put 'em on beats
And we give 'em back, no question

Granddaddy of the Midwest, Krayzie Jackson
The lyrical serial killer, I feel I'm the illest
Of niggas that's askin' about the mind I master
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster
Than half of these niggas rappin'
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin'
No time for second chances
When it all goes down (down)
When they put me in my grave
It's "Fuck 'Em All" across my tombstone
And bury me with my gauge (gauge)

Goin' through the struggles every day on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same

Nigga thought I told ya, (told ya) that the war ain't over (over)
You can roll (you can roll) you can get rolled over
My nigga we the frontline warriors

Whoever wanna bring the noise, talkin bout me and my boys
Disrespected on a regular like a nigga got caught
Well it's all about his Mo Thug music
Put my name in your mouth and a nigga gon' do you
Who the fuck them niggas tryin to play?

Change the World

Change the World
Young homie, think before you shoot, murderer
Where will our children go
When there's no place safe where they can go

(Bizzy Bone)
And trouble may come and sometimes
You'll get pulled over by one-time
And when the 1999 rewinds, you didn't even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world, it's nauseatin
Everybody's hatin everybody, overrated
Why everybody actin agitated, I thought we graduated
Back in the saddle waitin, aboard the battle station
Haitin is a birth defect and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains, close open up the door, no more

(-Big B)
See we loosin this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin won't end
So I'm reachin high up above
Lord, let your blessings begin

(-Big B) 4x
And let's change the world, and let's change the world

(Flesh Bone)
It got me ready to set off the riot
Ridin wit my Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls
Here we go, roll up some more Phillies

There's always something you got to give up

If you want everything you want

There's always something you got to give up

There's always something you got to give up
(Yeah, I know)
If you want everything you want
(But shit I don't know, I don't know)

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely, so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend

But I predicted this endin', back in the day
'Cause I had visions of bad decisions knew niggaz would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still wanna make the loot

No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail, you play 'em wrong then you fail

It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
'Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw

And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We split up, we tied up, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin' the devil get in, to the pen, devils pretendin' to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass

Should of stuck the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin' snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want
There's always something you got to give up
If you want everything you want

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died all of my niggaz came to the church

And thanks for comin', I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin'
But I'm still rappin' get it all off my chest

So I came back to the action

You better count your money, ghetto cowboy

The name is Krayzie Big Bad Ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
Now, that there's kidnappin' but she was with it, so I brought her

Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double-crossed by the law, so there's nobody to run to
Yeah, it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face

I'm headed for the West, heard they got
A couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure thats enough time for me to get the whole rundown

So, I continue my mission, it's gettin' dark
So I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns
They like to catch ya, then they rob and split
I be a rootin' tootin' shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips

All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse, whoa, Nellie, who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out
Thug Queen, the horse stealer?

Who is this? I hope this ain't the law
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun
C'mon out, right now I'm gettin' angry
Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous

Please don't shoot, it's just me
Then, why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes
I'm wanted in four counties for armed robbery
Killed to two sheriffs, six of his best men with my hand
Stole two horses

Thought you was the law, that's why I jumped in the bushes
Goodness now, she was hotter than the barrel on fire

And do away with all of the wicked shit like Mr. Police-man
And dog if you with it then pump ya fist in tha air
And pray for the politicians freely; get a amen?
The last days of the last days

Thats why I get high, that's why I get high
I'm holdin on to my soul
But nobody knows when it all unfolds
Then when I don't go
Remember the days cause all I got
I go on my own with bone
Bone bone muggin runnin through your door
Hoes speakin of the last day its on with the plastic trial
What do you know but I can't go wrong
When I kick it wit my song

Foe the love of money
Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now

Gotta get on the grind
Pop in the clip of my nine
And bitch if you slip
You hit the chalk and fall in the night time
Gotta get mine
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses
Hop on the phone
Callin' my nigga sin at home
Polishin' that MAC-10 chrome
Gotta a lick so bring yo shit
'cause once again it's on
To the dome with a fifth of burb
we wig to the curb so we swerve
And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin the dooehouse
Smoke jump outta me bong
So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge
I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay
Pullin' in the driveway, wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up
Buck, Buck, and a kaboom
Me blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed
And gotta move fast, why?
The po-po's comin'
Snatch up me yummy
So nigga don't think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quat
'cause flesh be lovin' this money

I'm given you love to the hustlers
All them St.Clair thugstas makin' that money stayin' on your feet
And you better believe gotta have that cheese
For the green leaves, never catch me sleep
Stay on the grind, get mine

East 1999 my niggas!
Think about back in the days when the year was '89.
Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine, doin' my crime with 2 in here, steady stackin' my ends, put my serve down on the Clair 9-9.
Hittin' up the Graveyard Shift with Real, Little Will, Big Wally, and Wish Bone.
Little Wally highrollers, and he wonder why niggas so strong.
Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod J--much love, kept a nigga on his toes in the game.
It's an everyday thang, when you let your nuts hang, gotta make a grand at least daily, man.
Them Cleveland hustlas, never no bustas.
Thug to the heartbeat of niggas from the Land fool, and the old school.
Just serve out your sentence and be cool.
Fuckin' with trues.
Rest In Peace, little nigga Ripsta, stressed that Bone love.
Smokin' on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug callin' all my niggas when it's time to nut 'em.
In the 9-9, haters gonna drop to the #1 with the gun, so run run.
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from, slangin' them dum-dums.
Krayzie
Niggas it's goin' down, up in the C-Town.
Get 'em up with the thug (thug) and that nigga with the bud (bud).
Get the fifth of Rose, but the liquor store closed and I'm all out the forty.
Raise up, nigga.
Burn up the buddah, smoke it all up.
Nigga, don't stiff on the reefer.
Mo!
runnin' up outta the cut with this fresh sack of hydro, and this shit is creeper.
Peep the street, bust again on Double Glock-glock with-ah-me rocks.
Cops sweatin' me block.
Copper better drop when the gunshot pop, blood, dumpin' the body and the bullshit stop.
Whenever the trouble knocks with the po-po, niggas roll solo, split up, and swerve.
Krayzie take caution.

Don't fuck around nigga he's a real buck 'em down nigga

See me rappin' on your tv actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person think we gon' flex or show you

Down for mine, gotta show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I feel with so much anger and pain
And if I drop then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm time to ring the alarm
Break the niggas out of prison killin' all the guards, woo!

Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet

See the real niggas ready out here taken control
See I'm screamin' out Mo'

Quit bringin' distrust to my spouse

Everyday it was almost the same thang
'Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

What you are about to hear will portray
The image of a young black male living everyday life
In the ghetto today
So Bone, drop dat

[Bizzy]
(You know what?) Live like a hustla
'Cause I ain't with bein' broke
I'm rollin' dope, and I'm bound to let the gun smoke
I'm gettin' richer everyday because
I'm selling crack, and, yo, police ain't jack
So I just wait to pull the trigger back
I sell a twenty, a ten, and I won't let you slide
I need all ten, and I ain't takin' nine ninety-nine
So how you figure you're gettin' up around the Bone?
You try to gank, you catch some blows to your damn dome
Don't take no shorts, that's why I'm climbin' to the top
And everyday I sell a thousand dollars worth of rocks
Yo, ain't it funny the way the Bone will make his money
And won't get caught because the cops
To me ain't nothin' but dummies?
So what you need? I'm servin'
Everything is straight. I mean it's great
And now I'm rollin' heavyweight
And coppers hate to see me come up off the 'cane
And makin' ends to Biz is like (just) an everyday thang

Everyday it was almost the same thang
'Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

I hit the floor
And now I'm lookin' for my khaki pants
I looked around and couldn't find 'em
So I put on Stan's
And then I headed to the closet for my Fila shoes

From the biggy-blues (siren)
That's when I headed out the hizzy
And jumped in the smug

So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh
So that you'll never forget me (forget me)
So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh

When I'm dead and gone
They gon' remember me as bein' one of the livest
Genuine ghetto survivors, when they think terror
Inside I pop in they mind, a silent killer
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
With lyrics more potent than a viper's venom
One bite could kill 'em
When I get in 'em niggas never knew what'd hit 'em
Legends, for what we done did on the streets
And what we done spit on these records
Blessings, we take 'em and put 'em on beats
And we give 'em back, no question

Granddaddy of the Midwest, Krayzie Jackson
The lyrical serial killer, I feel I'm the illest
Of niggas that's askin' about the mind I master
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster
Than half of these niggas rappin'
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin'
No time for second chances
When it all goes down (down)
When they put me in my grave
It's "Fuck 'Em All" across my tombstone
And bury me with my gauge (gauge)

Goin' through the struggles every day on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same

Bone Thugs... Akon, yeah

You know don't nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder

I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man (a black man)
And I come from the dark side so I'm having a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back
Prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really im wrong and again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane
Chasing me dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me goin' craaaazzzy lately
I've been so faded
Tryin' to erase it

Tell 'em they don't want none with' them Bone Thug boys.
We don't give a fuck about your 'hood, fuck ya'll. From the cradle to the grave I was brought up as a menace to society. A boy in the 'hood, I never let a nigga quiet me. Hopin' that the world don't see the wrong side of me. But that's what they get when a nigga wanna try me. Slide me the work, let me hit the corner quick. That's how we get our money on them nigga's that I'm runnin' with. Start buyin' chops; borrow me a glock. Set up shop and told the fiends, "Come get it! "

And we don't give a fuck about the po-po, when they trippin' we get with 'em: Any opposition try'na block a nigga mission. Cuttin' up our victim, listen this ain't scripted. Ain't no lights and cameras when it's time to get to wig-split. Nigga's chitta-chatta, don't matta. Them bitches whisper. But, when they slip up drunk, we gon' get'cha. When ya see the sawed-off pump, it's the Mr. If I gotta pop my trunk, ya'll got issues.

Stop bringin' that pistol and fetch ya
Shoot it and catch ya, shit, pap

Go fuckin' wit one of my own

No no, wrong, any place where my chrome
Left devils at they home
Double bang, execution, we mo murda, stupid trick
You, bitch that asked me

We don't play wit me game that be remainin' mine and little man ran
To disaster, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began

But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggaz thugin' off in the Claire
It's still the pen
Can't fuck wit these Cleveland Claire, playas

So as long as ya betta be workin'
'Cause the Bone and mo' thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way hoe

Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna separate from the previous, baby
Or maybe
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
And God's name, I pray

The devil, he be bringin' me down
I can feel him 'cause he pullin' me now
I've been blessed wit an incredible style
When there's pushin', it's just try to separate
And to break this all down, now ain't that foul

So I asked the Lord to help me
Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?
When we livin' in hell
But we chill most every day like we in heaven

Oh, well
But time will tell
Singin, "This is for the ringin' of the bell, the bell, the bell"
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful

If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you
Defeat you, deceive you, evil
He will never leave you alone
I've been lookin' for a better day

But they don't ever seem to want to come, my way

If maybe he can tell me why you hatin' on me
Bitin' on me, why you want me
To show a nigga leatherface in me
Don't fuck around nigga he's a real buck 'em down nigga
Motherfuck rappin' how bout fuckin' with me now nigga
Niggas get your checks from your broads get high
Then your broads sneak your keys from your niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party even the niggas with a problem
Hey nigga we can solve em, 'cause bitch we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all Mo T.
See me rappin' on your tv actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person think we gon' flex or show you
no action
Down for mine, gotta show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I feel with so much anger and pain
And if I drop then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm time to ring the alarm
Break the niggas out of prison killin' all the guards, woo!
Power to the people givin' people the power to put it down in your city
And fuck them hillbillies
Nigga I can't stand no mothafuckin' po-po
When will we start killin' these bitches and takin' no more
Mo thug the only clique that I claim
Although we all beyond the bangin'
You could say I roll with a gang
And then some chin checkers in the makin'
So nigga continue with the rotation

I say the war shouldn't stop until these playa hatin' niggas body rott [body

I'm gonna make sure you never forget me

Konvict

Goin through these struggles everyday on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin the same
There's a lotta haters that dont want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me

When I'm dead and gone they're gonna remember me as bein one of the livest
Genuine ghetto survivors when they gain terror inside
I pop in their mind, a silent killer
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
With lyrics more potent than a viper's venom
One bite could kill 'em, when I get in 'em
Niggas never knew what'd hit em
Legends
For what we done did on these streets
And what we done spit on these records
Blessings
We take em and put em on beats
n we give em back no question
Grandaddy of the mid-west
Crazy Jackson
The lyrical serial killer
I fell em, the innocent niggaz is askin' about the mind I mastered
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster than half of these niggas rappin
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin
No time for second chances
N when it all goes down and they put me in my grave
"Fuck em all" across my tombstone and bury me with my guage

Goin through these struggles everyday on this pavement

Bone Thugs Akon yeah

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard,
I tried hard... but I guess I
gotta try harder.

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin crazyyyy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later.

I try so hard

We don't give a fuck about your 'hood, fuck ya'll. From the cradle to the grave I was brought up as a menace to society. A boy in the 'hood, I never let a nigga quiet me. Hopin' that the world don't see the wrong side of me. But that's what they get when a nigga wanna try me. Slide me the work, let me hit the corner quick. That's how we get our money on them nigga's that I'm runnin' with. Start buyin' chops; borrow me a glock. Set up shop and told the fiends, "Come get it! "

And we don't give a fuck about the po-po, when they trippin' we get with 'em: Any opposition try'na block a nigga mission. Cuttin' up our victim, listen this ain't scripted. Ain't no lights and cameras when it's time to get to wig-split. Nigga's chitta-chatta, don't matta. Them bitches whisper. But, when they slip up drunk, we gon' get'cha.

Don't wanna see me fly
Don't wanna see me ride

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side

I get it and make it multiply, anything else is suicide
Enemy of the world, that's I energy of an eagle eye
See no evil and I hear no lie, niggas don't wanna see me fly

Higher than a rocket ship, life is not rocket science
Every day is documented, all of my time is occupied
I'm gon' grind and I'm gon' shine, ballin' 'til the end of time
Hate on me and it's all fine, you just ain't no friend of mine

I'm tryin' to focus on bigger and better things
With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game
Imagine problems with crooked coppers
Why they wanna go there? Tried to pop me, lock me
But couldn't knock me off my square

I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see
Flesh stretched out without my thugs, one steady stressin' out
But we doin' our own thing, the Bone thing
You suckas fail every time tryin' to stop my shine

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine

Hmm be ready to d-lo these plz rest in peace

Smoke another blunt, roll another up
You know that weed can really ease your mind
Every time I smoke good reefer that indo high makes me fly
If everybody smoked a blunt, relieve the mind, the world could be a better place
If everybody took a break and we all just got wasted
Toked out (out, out out), smoked out (out, out, out)
Choked out (out, out, out), pull another O (out, out, out)
Let's get P-O-D-ded (P-O-D-ded, P-O-D-ded)

The weed can't get no better (no better baby)

20 dollar hollars, all day, everyday
Come around my way, you gone want to stay
Weed makes me hungry, happy, and all I can say
Sure I need some more
Don't make we wait, stay awake, fake sleep
got the weed between the sheets
Catch me, Mary J. blessed me
Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt

And, Wally, even though you're gone, you've still got love from Bone.
My nigga, just rest your soul, and I'll see you at the Crossroad.

I'll never get over what some nigga told me: "Did you know that you're nigga, Wally, got pap pap at put in a coffin?" No! Why my nigga took a fall? Saw my nigga tryin' to swang them dums, (in the war) so we lost him. But, damn, why did ya have to kill 'em? I never did think it'd be one of my trues to get caught up in redrum. I sit and I pray everyday: God, don't let me get smoked; oh no, a nigga ain't scared to go, but I still got a lot to live for. But so did my nigga, my nigga--he's gone, and all he left was his memories. But when I die, you gon' see me. One, two, three, Wally rest in peace, please.

Slide me the work, let me hit the corner quick.
That's how we get our money on them nigga's that I'm runnin' with.

And we don't give a fuck about the po-po, when they trippin' we get with 'em: Any opposition try'na block a nigga mission.

Think about back in the days when the year was '89.
Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine, doin' my crime with 2 in here, steady stackin' my ends, put my serve down on the Clair 9-9.
Hittin' up the Graveyard Shift with Real, Little Will, Big Wally, and Wish Bone.
Little Wally highrollers, and he wonder why niggas so strong.
Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod J--much love, kept a nigga on his toes in the game.
It's an everyday thang, when you let your nuts hang, gotta make a grand at least daily, man.
Them Cleveland hustlas, never no bustas.
Thug to the heartbeat of niggas from the Land fool, and the old school.
Just serve out your sentence and be cool.
Fuckin' with trues.
Rest In Peace, little nigga Ripsta, stressed that Bone love.
Smokin' on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug callin' all my niggas when it's time to nut 'em.
In the 9-9, haters gonna drop to the #1 with the gun, so run run.
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from, slangin' them dum-dums.
Krayzie
Niggas it's goin' down, up in the C-Town.
Get 'em up with the thug (thug) and that nigga with the bud (bud).
Get the fifth of Rose, but the liquor store closed and I'm all out the forty.
Raise up, nigga.
Burn up the buddah, smoke it all up.
Nigga, don't stiff on the reefer.
Mo!
runnin' up outta the cut with this fresh sack of hydro, and this shit is creeper.
Peep the street, bust again on Double Glock-glock with-ah-me rocks.
Cops sweatin' me block.
Copper better drop when the gunshot pop, blood, dumpin' the body and the bullshit stop.
Whenever the trouble knocks with the po-po, niggas roll solo, split up, and swerve.
Krayzie take caution.

Let's get pumped for the peeps in Egypt, spread 400 years of oppression
Spread the message I ain't finishes, diminished you so-called critics
So fuck them billboards and the billboard status can kick it
You fucked up for a while for today, but that was a trial
Man, and I don't know how, style through with them crowds

We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always, and ready to bring the war if you hate, if you hate.
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Could you tell me what you see?
Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards, my niggas is stone cold killas, peelas, dippin' out the limos and bitch, y'all just maintain, givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'.
My gang, you know me.
Homies got mo' love, and the Biz follow all of my senses, pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders, Jesus sent me his roll and (?) soul but load a revolver, hold up, now, buck 'em all to Hell, 'cause I'm showin' 'em.
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck, ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out.
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up.
Hold up, and wait a minute.
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga.
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Could you tell me what you see?
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago.
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit.
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, and don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy.
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that, but a y'all fin to get stomped.

You'll never find a thuggish bunch of niggas like us
Don't be so quick to test us I'll be annoyed and might bust
I'ma have to talk to Eazy through the ouija, so I can see
If maybe he can tell me why you hatin' on me
Bitin' on me, why you want me
To show a nigga leatherface in me
Don't fuck around nigga he's a real buck 'em down nigga
Motherfuck rappin' how bout fuckin' with me now nigga
Niggas get your checks from your broads get high
Then your broads sneak your keys from your niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party even the niggas with a problem
Hey nigga we can solve em, 'cause bitch we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all Mo T.
See me rappin' on your tv actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person think we gon' flex or show you
no action
Down for mine, gotta show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I feel with so much anger and pain
And if I drop then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm time to ring the alarm
Break the niggas out of prison killin' all the guards, woo!
Power to the people givin' people the power to put it down in your city
And fuck them hillbillies
Nigga I can't stand no mothafuckin' po-po
When will we start killin' these bitches and takin' no more
Mo thug the only clique that I claim
Although we all beyond the bangin'
You could say I roll with a gang

Oh, well, if ya snooze ya loose
Stop bringin' that pistol and fetch ya
Shoot it and catch ya, shit, pap

Dat pistol go tap at niggas, who
Go fuckin' wit one of my own

No no, wrong, any place where my chrome
Left devils at they home
Double bang, execution, we mo murda, stupid trick
You, bitch that asked me

We don't play wit me game that be remainin' mine and little man ran
To disaster, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began

But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggaz thugin' off in the Claire
It's still the pen
Can't fuck wit these Cleveland Claire, playas

So as long as ya betta be workin'
'Cause the Bone and mo' thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way hoe

Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna separate from the previous, baby
Or maybe
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
And God's name, I pray

The devil, he be bringin' me down
I can feel him 'cause he pullin' me now
I've been blessed wit an incredible style
When there's pushin', it's just try to separate
And to break this all down, now ain't that foul

So I asked the Lord to help me
Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?
When we livin' in hell
But we chill most every day like we in heaven

Oh, well
But time will tell
Singin, "This is for the ringin' of the bell, the bell, the bell"
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful

If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you
Defeat you, deceive you, evil
He will never leave you alone
I've been lookin' for a better day

But they don't ever seem to want to come, my way

Destroy ya paranoia will make me blow you away but hey

Better act like yo know I'm rolling with Mo posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs we must doin our best to obey god violent in these times
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine
Slim nigga gotta get up and go and get it if it's really coming

Everybody by now should know my label, my thugsta, these things guidin' your struggles.

Do or die, (that died to Boo--he go bye) whom die they lie in the face of our society.
Try at of every attempt to quiet me, I got a nation that's down to ride with me.
Here's the deal, can I get a witness?
It's deeper than survival.
Who am I?
My brother's keeper?
Yeah, I be clutchin' on my Bible, willing to die.
The wicked is near me, dearly departed, but nobody hears me.
Is we all gon' fall in misery?
It's so serious, it bring tears to me.
Ears to the street, like a drum to the beat, creepin' up my block.
I'm already knowin' a nigga wanna do me, so I stay strapped. (Don't pose for the cop), crooked cops, they gonna harass me, ask me the same ol' bullshit questions, knowin' I'm a thug with bud for days, keepin'
a pistol in my possession, but a thuggish ruggish soldier like myself gon' move on, and prevail, avoid jail, collect my mill with my Bones, splittin' domes.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, don't make me hurt ya.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, all about that bloody murder.

Everytime I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin' on a bad plan
Tryin' to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin' a thugsta

At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time

There's always somebody talkin' 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggas ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine

Everytime I turn around there's somebody straight trippin'
Hatin' on a mission, fakin' on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
Like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out

Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Everytime that I turn around
Somebody all up in my business

Actin' like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
Knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him

Everytime I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggas never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin' niggaz was weak but we showed 'em

We on top it ain't no stoppin' us, the suckas wishin' we would go away
So they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin' 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray

I'm duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Everytime that I turn around
Duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Everytime I turn around somebody doin' somethin' foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin' to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize but the clock
Is sayin' time don't wait for nothin', it don't stop

Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it

Tryna find my way back
To my roots where the true thugs lay at
And I say that, "I'm tryna go home

And my time zone is on freeze"

In the mean time I turn best to better
And in between time trying to be blessed forever

Stabbin' at me like gravity, tryna trap me, snatchin' at me
The Devil is laughing at me, evil happenin, jealousy be the reason, bitches scandalous
Money's another reason niggas savages
They want what I got, I tell them, "Not happening"
And I make sure the haters stay so far from back of me
But they always come after me
Everybody wanna pull a nigga down
They wanna live it when a nigga down
Wait, but chasing this paper, ya'll niggas fake and Krayzie's gon' shake ya, straight out the game
We tryna make major, never let a nigga never think they can fade us
Yes, I can feel your gravity on me cause I get way too high
Way too high

Pressure on me
With your love
Nothing weighs me down
Rise above onto our feet

We just tryna fly through the sky, come lets float
We tryna stay high, rise way higher than most
We just tryna fly through the sky, come lets float
We tryna stay high, rise way higher than most

Rise way higher than most

Rise way higher than most

Step in the party, I'm tryna get me some liquor in me
I got the feeling that I'm finna go over my limit
And never underestimate me cause I got it in me
I know how high I can go
I usually get it started after sundown
Forget about my problems 'til the sunrise
And let me live the life at least one time
I'm like how I high can flow
I got money in the bank
So I can still get high

We was partners from the start
Hurt my heart that you're not here
And it's all cause you my dog
This one thought brought me to tears
Anytime I squad I call
We show balls and how to fear
Now your name highlights the wall
There they reach rest in peace yes deceased
I can't believe you're really here no more
Because in my mind, at any second you'll come through the door
It's all in my mind
I see you waiting on this merry go
Cause I know in time
I meet you, greet you in the physical
So I take flight
And we stay high
I take flight
And we stay high

There's no good explanation why your time had to run out
I can't believe that you're gone now
I think of you like you're still around
I call your name but there's no sound
Stop, look, listen
There's no sound
Hope God will make it clear one day, why he took you away from me
I wish I could rewrite the way

I wish there was a way to change the story
I wish there was a way to change the story
I wish there was a way to change the story
I wish there was a way to change the story
I wish there was a way to change the story
It's crazy

Little Eazy's last niggas
New wave for the golden age
That's when it was 'Pac and Big
And a lot just had to change
That's when if you popped your shit
Better defend the home plate
Had to be tough
Survival was the one, it was willing to catch the case
The bible was San Augustus waters
Like the trials was
Who keep the files cause
Time will travel miles cuz
Keep my love, keep my blood
But I think my smile was
Rest in peace Eazy

When the world has you cornered
And you can't make a way
As time is growing shorter
Not much more you can take
And all when I got it with you on my side

I'll be your fighter
I'll be ruthless for you
I'll be your fighter
I'll be ruthless for you

When the world is on your shoulder
I'll be there I'm your soldier
A friend like I'm supposed to be
To the end I rise, so row for me
I'ma be right by your side while everybody else is runnin' and hidin'
I'll be frontline
I'll be your light, be ready to guide ya, hide ya

No no, wrong, any place where my chrome
Left devils at they home
Double bang, execution, we mo murda, stupid trick
You, bitch that asked me

We don't play wit me game that be remainin' mine and little man ran
To disaster, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began

But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggaz thugin' off in the Claire
It's still the pen
Can't fuck wit these Cleveland Claire, playas

So as long as ya betta be workin'
'Cause the Bone and mo' thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way hoe

Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna separate from the previous, baby
Or maybe
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
And God's name, I pray

The devil, he be bringin' me down
I can feel him 'cause he pullin' me now
I've been blessed wit an incredible style
When there's pushin', it's just try to separate
And to break this all down, now ain't that foul

So I asked the Lord to help me
Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?
When we livin' in hell
But we chill most every day like we in heaven

Oh, well
But time will tell
Singin, "This is for the ringin' of the bell, the bell, the bell"
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful

If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you
Defeat you, deceive you, evil
He will never leave you alone

But they don't ever seem to want to come, my way

And every time I extend my heart to my mother

They say everything happin' for a reason
Can you tell me why these niggas bleedin'
Needin' general assistance?
Out here needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet
But see brain so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See the real niggas ready out here taken control
See I'm screamin' out Mo'
With my pockets on swoll
Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' this stress to my spouse
'cause I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out
If you niggas try to run up on the Bone
I'm gonna show you like this I'm gonna pull out my chrome
I don't wanna have to send a nigga home
Lord please take me home
Come and take me home

Take, take me home

Now tell me whatcha gonna do when there ain't no where to run
When judgment comes for you, when judgment comes for you
Tell me whatcha gonna do when there ain't no where to hide
When judgment comes for you 'coz it's gonna come for you

Let's all bring it in for Wally, Eazy sees uncle Charlie
Little Boo, God's got him and I'm gonna miss everybody
I only roll with Bone my gang look to where they lay
When playing with destiny, play too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease well then please
Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me

God bless you, working on a plan to heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, God is who we praise
Even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I guess my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Oh, what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We living our lives to eternal our soul

Hey, and we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
And we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray

Soon I'll be coming home

Been around the world like a rolling stone
Seen the whole world wide through my own eyes
Been a long time coming
A million miles and still running
Tryna find my way back
To my roots where the true thugs lay at
And I say that, "I'm tryna go home
Take me somewhere that
My mind mode is on free
And my time zone is on freeze"
Everything stop!
I'mma need a little bit of time to get myself together
In the mean time I turn best to better
And in between time trying to be blessed forever
I hear home calling back for me

I think it's time I take a flight
To elevate my mind and make it my life
Been tryna get right
The big lights blinding me, they bright
I've been in darkness most my life
So I fight with all of my might
To make it back one day
Nigga someday it'll all work out someway

Sun up to sundown we going

Thought they could get rid a' da twist of the tounge,
They thought we was finished, but we just beginning,
They want me committed, to the murder, onneee
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, competition, ready to die,
Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin my rhyme,
Imma criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm,

With a couple of my cats in the hood, smokin' weed and up to no good
Red Dog in the trunk, and we rollin' that
Bang or slang, now bail on over to your thugs
So me and the rest of these thugs can marinade, marinade

These niggas wanna take my health and wealth
Check yourself, tryin' to contend, but they couldn't win
You took it to the head with a fifth of Hen
Now we in a red 500 Benz-o, we roll, roll
Drop the top, and lock the locks, cock the glock
Bout to hit this corner, livin' like a thug on the real

Got your mind blown, vocal tones keep it sewn
Blastin' out your steroes or your headphones
The roots exploited clones; therefore
It's my job to describe the loudness, the habitat of rap survival kit
Artistic skin abrasion, so when 'em fadin' my worldly reflections
It's magnified to new levels of elevation

What if we slowed it down?

So, when them funky, funky jump me
Gon' be ready to roll (ready to roll)

But, oh no, niggas heard the flow
And wanted a piece of the cake

But when kept on disrespectin'
Make 'em think we shit's real, nigga

And schemin' for the money, man, so we packin'

I'm sending a message to warn you imposters
All hating in my business
When I see you I'm a drop you
Get slugged and get drugged
My niggas I'll hustle to pay the judge
Got you when I spot you I should pop you
Even the boss was telling me not to
But I won't stop until they get shot
When they get out the hospital
They gonna get shot, too
The fast one bringing that AK
Better walk, then we even
When I leave and flees to Cleveland
Now, murder 'em and rest in peace
So goodbye. We're shutting it down
And now we're prowling niggas from alleys
Cloning our sound, we found your town
Now is you ready for the war?
Cry loud and go
Many if all niggas 'll fall off in they sleep
And even oppose and order them hoes
Gonna flee with me?
Bitch, fuck with me then see that
My little aliens, yeah
We come to your city. Can they really
Put it on down with the pistol?
Can you feel me, feel me?

What's the consequence?
Now I'm 'bout to get
Real deadly. Ready for the war
When we just start bombing shit
Trying to cop my click?
Hell no! Real raw. Y'all niggas thought this was a game?
Now it's time to make you feel the pain
Wanna test my everyday thang?
I aim straight for your temple
It's really that simple when I seen it splatter
Had I even killed one of you clones
Then the rest of y'all wouldn't even matter
Scattered. Run for the border

Aw, triple-platinum, nigga, digga, and still thuggin' with the roughest muthafuckas in my city, and a nigga wonder, "
How they still chillin' like that?
Ain't you scared of a nigga that's tryin' to jack ya paper, snatch ya?" No.
I really wish a nigga would turn and wanna take what's mine, 'cause I got an AK-47 shootin' trey-O times.
You didn't think I'm willing to find a way to say, "
Oh, my!" but check it out, though.
I done made enough money to buy my ghetto a lot of weapons, y'all.
And I made it, takin' out my weed.
Here, stay high, nigga, so paranoia is factor when a nigga wanna act up.
Nigga figure I'm quiet, then he 1ook at my sawed-offs, and they figure they can try me, like a muthafucka won't swang back or somethin', or even pull a nine out my jacket, and start dumpin'.
Fuck 'em.
I think a nigga see us on the video and playa hate and say that we ain't true to what we say, but, then again, when you see us on the street and playa hate, we bang them fuckin' brains .
But then, we switch subject, and fuck with them clones that suck the thug dick.
Run around foul, tellin' people we stole your style.
Muthafucka, we ain't never been in your town.
It's all original when it's comin' from the Cleveland criminals, so here we go.
Got a gun--should I buck 'em on down?
Or should I kill 'em when I put the instrumental on?

Lookin' so deep eyes, and tell it when they lyin'
Stop tryin', but they never convince none

Still I'm sure they sure they fryin' us, but I buck

I never turn my back on y'all
I got my halo cocked, goin' out with y'all, ya'll

Come look at this world that's ever so cruel
But the good Lord blessed us
Gave me true family I can depend on
500 Benz with the Synchro rims on
Now I can get off when the wind blow
But I'd like to thank you, Jesus Christ
For givin' for givin' up Your life for us
Now, I can think twice, 'fore roll the dice
Advice from a thug, tell mommy I love her everyday, think of her
Take a look at your thugs to the front of the line
Hear the thunder grind off in my mind
We done partied overtime
Destruction, terror, oh what an era!
Let's get it together 'fore it's over
Be a soldier like my Mo Thug family

Now who was the nigga that came back ridin' dirty, stylin' murda
With a weapon up under my seat, you creep, indeed you'll meet the burner
Burn baby, burn burn burn, set em on fire
And I'm really not near with a nigga but see it's whatever, whatever, I'm wired
Feel the 12 gauge eruption - Playa hata dead now
No more discussion - Swimmin' in his all red now
Empty out yo pockets, if it's blinging, nigga drop it
Is it pistols, means it's nonsense - That mean murda if I cock it
Mo murda, mo murda redrum
Catch you niggas slippin' and I hit you with this lead son
Split your fuckin' wig and leave you drippin', make you bled some
I'm here to battle if you don't come with a weapon
A lyrical monster - My niggas are comin' to bomb yah
My niggas'll critically calm ya
The bullets, they enter, they calm ya
We steady be ready for drama - I'm willing to bet on my momma
Before we leave this bitch I betcha show me nuff respect

(Flesh:)
Hard dog from the hall of fame, Thor
That's for they know the real me in the pain
I wish I could do this plain
But that's impossible when there's too many lame...
Ho's running around, calling they self hot
We sure that you need is the fake and fraugulent in out of Pac

You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be
Feeling similarily
And led to believe, I was okay
To just walk away
From the one thing that's unyielding
And sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalaunt about it
And I'm going to extremes, to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly loosing my mind
Underneath a guise of a smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel, and I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal, the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise, till I go home at night
And turn down the lights and then I breakdown and cry (cry cry cry)

So what do you do, when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain and rejection it's putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing "I Will Survive" (get control hold on, hold on)
Do you lash out and say (hold on, got to get control)
"How could you leave me this way" (hold on hold on)
Do you hold on in vain (hold on)
As they just slip away (got to get control hold on)

It's probably 'cause you been naughty to get up in the party.
She wanna make it so she'll sleep with him, late-night creep with him.
He'll tell her he can make her famous if she did him.
Suck 'em, lick 'em.
Another victim of a busta intention.
Why must you suffer this?
Really, love?, what's the mission?
Because you still should be in ya daddy and ya momma house.
Shoulda knew homie was not about to go the dumber route.

I'm not that nigga trickin dough just to stick dick to a hoe

Now what? Not the nigga to bow down to the law
I'm not that nigga to snitch, and I'm not that nigga you saw
I'm not that nigga to switch, I keep it hard to the core

But without you boy, I'd be bored all the time

But see that's what the Hennessey & gin will do
And I've been scoping
You already know I'm feeling you
Visualizing, fantasizing
Different ways to get into you
And I don't mean to come off cynical

Let's skip all the subliminals
I'm the nigga you want
And you just what I need right now
As I breeze through the clouds
Ain't no need to fly down, c'mon
We should flee to my house
Lovely, love me long time
Come hop in my fly Mercedes, baby
Just for tonight I beg ya ma'am you're my lady
I know she sneaky with it

So let's cut off the lights
And me and you can get it
See I got my own lil nasty girl
To come in play in Bone Bone's nasty world

Hands up high, let em' stay there

And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin the dooehouse
Smoke jump outta me bong
So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge
I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay
Pullin' in the driveway, wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up
Buck, Buck, and a kaboom
Me blew all them bodies all over the room

And gotta move fast, why?

Snatch up me yummy
So nigga don't think it's funny

Eazy-E:
Black nigga killa, killa, killa, killa

Eazy-E:
Black nigga killa. Hate brought death around the block as a hollow point bust through the punk's back. Raisin' Cain, feel no
pain as I penetrate. Nigga five deep as I strike at a quick pace. I got the evil of my dead nigga trapped in my mind so my soul
is a threat to all mankind. Born to kill, I'm wicked by nature, 'cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hellraisers. A
30.06 with the scope I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast. Muthaf**kas catchin' heat as I bring anger, and
release more danger from my chamber. The evil in my blood is possessed, so I creep low from the back slow and push lead
through that nigga's flesh. Ain't no hope when every nigga wants to be the nine-milla, on the trigger, the black nigga killa.

Krayzie:
We be the mighty warrior. Black nigga killa, what's up? You ready to die? You think you can f**k with them thug niggas?
Come on, tell me the truth, nigga. Look in my eyes. Bitch, we get live. Bone thugs-n-harmony, nigga--Cleveland's thuggish
ruggish niggas still down with the thug shit. Buck, buck, bust. Let 'em know we still run this bitch just like an assassin. Say,
nigga, we nice but can get nasty. Get into war, what else can it be? Nigga, you know what we came here for. You know,
when we shot through the door, my niggas was serious, playin no jokes. Just 'cause I'm a rapper, you thought it's for show?
Okay nigga let's see if this a real fo'-fo'. You thought we was studio, saw us on video, seen us in person so here we go [here
we go]. What is your problem? Here come the bullets, better dodge 'em. I sneaks up behind, so I'm f**kin' with killas.

I'll never get over what some nigga told me:
"Did you know your nigga Wally got pap pap and put in a coffin?"
No! Why my nigga took a fall?
Saw my nigga try to swing them dums, (in the war) so we lost him
But, damn, why did ya have to kill 'um?
I never did think it'd be one of my trues to get caught up in redrum
I sit and I pray everyday: God, don't let me get smoked
Oh no, a nigga ain't scared to go, but I still got a lot to live for
But so did my nigga, my nigga--he gone
And all that he left are his memories
But when I die, you gon' see me

Don't fuck around nigga he's a real buck 'em down nigga
Motherfuck rappin' how bout fuckin' with me now nigga
Niggas get your checks from your broads get high
Then your broads sneak your keys from your niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party even the niggas with a problem
Hey nigga we can solve em, 'cause bitch we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all Mo T.
See me rappin' on your tv actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person think we gon' flex or show you
no action
Down for mine, gotta show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I feel with so much anger and pain
And if I drop then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm time to ring the alarm
Break the niggas out of prison killin' all the guards, woo!
Power to the people givin' people the power to put it down in your city
And fuck them hillbillies
Nigga I can't stand no mothafuckin' po-po
When will we start killin' these bitches and takin' no more
Mo thug the only clique that I claim
Although we all beyond the bangin'
You could say I roll with a gang

Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Fuck 'em(X2)

Surprise.
You're muthafuckin' right.

Krayzie:
Yo, fuck the police, comin' straight from the underground.
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown and not the other color.
Some police think they have the authority to kill a minority,
but muthafucka mad, 'cause I ain't the one for a punk muthafucka
with a badge and a gun to be beatin' on and thrown in jail. But we
can go toe to toe in the middle of the cell. Fuckin' with a
nigga, 'cause a nigga turned major, and got a little bit of money
and they play us, search a nigga car, lookin' for a product,
thinkin' every thug nigga sellin' narcotics. They'd rather see
me in the pen, than me blowin' indo rollin' in my Benz-o. I send the
police to the grave, and when I'm finished, nigga, bring the
yellow tape to tape off the scene of the slaughter, still gettin' swoll
off bread and water. I don't know if they fags or what--search a nigga
down and grab on his nuts. And on the other hand, without
a gun they can't get none, but don't let it be a black and a white one,
'cause they'll slam ya down to the street top. Black police
showin' out for the white cop, but Krayzie Bone will swarm on
any muthafucka in a blue uniform. Just 'cause I'm from the
C-L-E, the punk muthafuckas are afraid of me, huh. A young nigga

Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, to my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside
the solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim

Lifting me up through the dirt that I found
Taking me well beyond leaps and bounds

Seconds to run

At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe

There's always somebody talkin 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggaz ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine
Every time I turn around there's somebody straight trippin
Hatin on a mission, fakin on a nigga

Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest

I give her that thug love for doing my stuff
Girl, everything 100
I'ma keep it 100
Everything 100, everything 100, everything 100

You know I keep it true to my brain
Girl, I always stay one in me, I kept it real for 20 years, I ain't changed
Be careful when you cruising in my lane
Watch me creep out through your rearview as I gas right past these lames
We did it how we did it ‘cause we did it for the money
Living on, living this, you really, really love this
You want a thug nigga like me
Yeah, you know they all love niggas like me

She ain't complaining mainly ‘cause everything I do is entertaining
hangin swagin body banging, she in trainin, to be famous
Yeah, she speak the language, baby know just where the lane is
She with me, she'd never named the stranger, know we are armed & dangerous
This ain't your deal, this still the thugs shit but this for them playas
This for the ones that's putting the smoke up in the air

We're not against rap
We're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs (thugs thugs)

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone Your feelin' the strength of the rump
Step up, hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin, straight buzzin, lovin yo peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring yo weapon, when steppin
Bring on that ammunition, trippin' on sip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But i gotta get mine, so scream out, mo, and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the bone, mo' thugs will follow
Chain gang, remains the same
Flamin my dank and drinkin brew
Thinkin about hangin, clockin my bank, and thuggin trues, foo's

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone Get ready for the bone and the mo thug, bustas
You know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat, maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straight jackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now, livin in my black trench vest
You gotta be down there bang bang

So can I get a witness

Fuck the po po pow
Startin' to kick this
Gonna get my shit
And then you fucked up

Niggas ain't talkin' 'bout them thangs.
Thugs remain
Hang, swang with a click tight claim
Come again, now
They drop down
When I'm off the block
Fuck them cops
Me and Krayzie
Runnin' through the Boneyard, daily
Gotta give 'em up to the glock-glock, so I can serve me thugs and maintain To the brain, and thugs remain to slang thangs
Long live the dope game
And it won't end ya, as long as my niggas remember: no pretender
Get right up off the Clair, nigga, Fuck it
No surrender

Not wantin' the copper to hit me a lick up
Found me a victim to stick up
Pick up, rollin' the nine-ball
Slippin' that's why me trippin' bloody victim
Get him when the time calls, dog

Creepin' up outta the woods, gotta give love to my hood
Smoke, and I choke, and I creep on a come up
Niggas be tryin run up, but I bust, and they drop to their death
Now they done up. Gun up, hunt my blunt up
Creepin' 'til sun up, feelin' slightly shady
Call me lightweight crazy, number one nigga little Layzie
Nigga don't wanna fight
Runnin' deadly thugsta soldiers, droppin' them thangs
Bone done told ya. Testin' nuts, so a nigga gonna have to show ya
Faded a nigga that stepped up. Let's slip in some shit
See 'em alls just stood up then put a foot up that ass
Had to blast that click-click
Sprayed the gauge, all cocked, and ready to spray down to the pave
Puttin' them souls up off in them graves
Dwell in Hell, they'll all lay slayed
Amazed, must I blaze. It's insane when I take that bud to the brain
Toke, choke, holdin' me smoke until-a me strained, feelin' no pain
Better be packin' your weapon, cause my shit is kept
And I'm ready to let loose sawed-off hangin'
Danglin' up under the trench, fin to blow that chest
But you shoulda wore a vest, fool, cause the Bone don't front
Nigga check or get wrecked
Got Flesh on the set, with his finger on a TEC
Loc'd out with the khakis and high techs
Respect them St. Clair thugs hustlin' drugs, gotta make that money, man
Rap be the thang, and the fact remains that we owns that rap gameBang, bang, gotta get down for my thang
Bone be me gang

We runnin' with no hoes, and the bigger Bone that's
Known for gettin' his swerve on and kickin' it on the stage

Right about now, Thugs-n-harmony is on a come up
So to all you busters out there, beware

Stalkin' (gat fools), walkin' jack moves

Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin' a bank to get rich
Ain't ate in days so it ain't no thing to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen, and I'm low on ends, fuck calm, I tried to stay thug
Got flowin' skills, but niggas, they bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the forty-four mag plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag, can't reveal when I glide with the moneybag
ride to the hide, count my flags. I be livin' on the darkside
And I can't escape, some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is if I play with my gauge
It's a raid. Put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets, watches, jewels, and you'll be safe
I snatched the clerk up by her neck, put the gun in her mouth and said
"Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
if you wanna be killed try some stupid shit
And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell"
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
Locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail
Well, tickets I'm out the door
hopped in the smug, and I break fast
Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, loc'd out as I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good, and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight. Covered my tracks
Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine, and if you stall, then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid. I'll rob ya
See, a nigga creep on a come up

Gotta make that money man

Gotta make that money man

Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money man

Gotta get on the grind
Pop in the clip of my nine
And bitch if you slip
You hit the chalk and fall in the night time
Gotta get mine
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses
Hop on the phone
Callin' my nigga sin at home
Polishin' that MAC-10 chrome
Gotta a lick so bring yo shit
'cause once again it's on
To the dome with a fifth of burb
we wig to the curb so we swerve
And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin the dooehouse
Smoke jump outta me bong
So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge
I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay
Pullin' in the driveway, wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up
Buck, Buck, and a kaboom
Me blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed
And gotta move fast, why?
The po-po's comin'
Snatch up me yummy
So nigga don't think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quat
'cause flesh be lovin' this money

I'm given you love to the hustlers
All them St.Clair thugstas makin' that money stayin' on your feet
And you better believe gotta have that cheese
For the green leaves, never catch me sleep
Stay on the grind, get mine

I been stuck in the struggle
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in the touch
Instead of usin' my muscle
And everytime I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
If a nigga pull my number
If it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam'
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man
Got a soul program
I'ma pump my fist
I'm stayin' ready for this
And you can put this on Wish
I never seen the abyss
And when I needed a ride
You wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my cris
You niggas all on my dick
I wanna change the world
You wanna change ya life
I wouldn't a put up a fight
If I knew it was trite
They say everything happin' for a reason
Can you tell me why these niggas bleedin'
Needin' general assistance
Out here needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet
But see? so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See the real niggas ready out here taken control
See I'm screamin' out Mo'
With my pockets on swoll
Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' distrust to my spouse
Casuse I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out
If you niggas try to run up on the Bone
I'ma show you like this I'ma pull out my chrome
I don't wanna have to send a nigga home
Lord please take me home
Come and take me home

(What about us?) What about my partners doin' time?
(What about us?) What about this harassment from the police?
(What about us?) What about my young thugstaz?

Its for my, incarcerated niggaz
That stuck in the pin they coming home
Gotta stay strong cause you aint alone
Remember you always got love from home
They steal this pain and may not know it
I'm a boy and I gotta show it
I hear them cries from the babies
I wish they had a chance don't wanna blow it
But unemployed for all the little girls and boys
You got'sa, love your mom and daddy
And make them wonder why you give them ploys
Oh boy, its getting deep but more expensive then ever cheap
But what about that little nigga running the streets
Making a living through his beats
What about these whack ass politicians
They don't care if we live or die
What about that elderly barely breathing, gotta survive on SSI
They say America, it's the land of the free and home of the brave
Its mass hysteria, so bring your knees and hope we can fight
And if bury us, at least we can live as we believe
Dog aint ever gonna break our pride
Aint nothing you can do to keep us weak
And all of my soldiers come together
Get on your feet and get ready to bust
What about this war against terrorism (fuck that)
And what about this war against us

Most of my time I'm out here puttin' in work
For all of my days that I run this earth

You never know about this life and the type of pain that it can bring
That's why you gotta get off of you're thing cuz it ain't no dream and it

But now I grind a little bit harder
Harder my niggaz stories in order

If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, went to throw it at em
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollas
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'ma live everyday
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory
What you thought I play for keeps
Put it down wicked in these streets
Heavily armored with the heat
Just in case a nigga want some beef
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on

Money money, the mighty dolla dolla
Got to get my grind on, grind on, grind on

Its bone thugs, mighty bone thugs
Bone thug, bone, bone thug

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]I told em imma get up, get out and get something,
But I was a little bitty nothin, in the city thuggin,
Neva been a nigga that's eta fucked none less than a hundred percent,
The hustle that's in me, my thug mentality
Show me what to do to improve my salary,
Don't nobody move cause you could be a casualty,
One a dem, maybe dey crossed paths with me
One nigga left and they thought we was done,
Thought they could get rid a' da twist of the tounge,
They thought we was finished, but we just beginning,
They want me committed, to the murder, onneee
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, competition, ready to die,
Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin my rhyme,
Imma criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm,
Did I mention my fast flowin,
lately its got my cash growin wit'an ass showin,
These niggas cant see Bone, they already know,
Came down with a style unfamiliar sound,
That's how we kicked in the doo-oo-oor

Right off the jump, ooh, now I gots to let you know
When you see me runnin' rollin' with them big shotguns,
And we deep when we creep, never sleepin'

And we droppin' them whamies on fools who wanna get dumb and numb
Now, that you know like that
These niggas come around, they don't know how to act
In fact, I'm at the track in the back
With a couple of my cats in the hood, smokin' weed and up to no good
Red Dog in the trunk, and we rollin' that
Bang or slang, now bail on over to your thugs
So me and the rest of these thugs can marinade, marinade
We straight, get high, so high,
That's how my mental,
that's how my mental state is like parlay, parlay
Like everyday, don't think I don't pin playa hation
But ya better pinnin' yourself, or contend with the M-11,
.357 Automatic weapons from my shelf
These niggas wanna take my health and wealth
Check yourself, tryin' to contend, but they couldn't win
You took it to the head with a fifth of Hen
Now we in a red 500 Benz-o, we roll, roll
Drop the top, and lock the locks, cock the glock
Bout to hit this corner, livin' like a thug on the real
Who's stronger when I put it on ya, on ya, all playa haters goners

Murder, mo murder, mo murder, mo murder them all

They fall, they fall buck buck, oh yeah

Bone Thugs... Akon, yeah

You know don't nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder

I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man (a black man)
And I come from the dark side so I'm having a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back
Prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really im wrong and again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane
Chasing me dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me goin' craaaazzzy lately
I've been so faded
Tryin' to erase it

My nigga, just rest your soul, and I'll see you at the Crossroad.

I'll never get over what some nigga told me: "Did you know that you're nigga, Wally, got pap pap at put in a coffin?" No! Why my nigga took a fall? Saw my nigga tryin' to swang them dums, (in the war) so we lost him. But, damn, why did ya have to kill 'em? I never did think it'd be one of my trues to get caught up in redrum. I sit and I pray everyday: God, don't let me get smoked; oh no, a nigga ain't scared to go, but I still got a lot to live for. But so did my nigga, my nigga--he's gone, and all he left was his memories. But when I die, you gon' see me. One, two, three, Wally rest in peace, please.

Enemy of the world, that's I energy of an eagle eye
See no evil and I hear no lie, niggas don't wanna see me fly

Higher than a rocket ship, life is not rocket science
Every day is documented, all of my time is occupied
I'm gon' grind and I'm gon' shine, ballin' 'til the end of time
Hate on me and it's all fine, you just ain't no friend of mine

I'm tryin' to focus on bigger and better things
With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game
Imagine problems with crooked coppers
Why they wanna go there? Tried to pop me, lock me
But couldn't knock me off my square

I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see
Flesh stretched out without my thugs, one steady stressin' out
But we doin' our own thing, the Bone thing
You suckas fail every time tryin' to stop my shine

Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side

Come and get showed, there'll be gauges and uzis

Can't none of ya break off a niggas from prison
And let 'em come with us - retaliation
We come and blast 'em with leather masks on
Let loose

You need beware when your rollin' down the Clair
These niggas is killas, try to feel us
Thuggish ruggish niggas from Cleveland
We steadily creepin' on ya
And you better believe that we bring that pap-pap to your doorstep
Ho-check, you don't wanna fuck with Bone
Let loose

Nigga, bulletproof, if a muthafucka pull it
Then he better shoot
Nigga never no 9-1-1 to your rescue
Never repsect you, blowin' your chest through
Labelled as a menace, but I'm feelin' it again
And I'm in it to the finish, better check my manuscript
Killa, for realer, drugdealer, little nigga, cap peeler
Bailin' through the Land equipped
When I grips the grip, pump, shot it, shot it

Say you shoot me and I'm not dead, forgive me Lord, you just went out the side or you die in the ward
If you're mad, saw Itola, don't mean shit to me
In the struggle all I'm worried bout is victory

For all of my days that I run this earth

You never know about this life and the type of pain that it can bring
That's why you gotta get off of you're thing cuz it ain't no dream and it

I know time is the devil's workshop

So come on ride the train, you should ride it
Make sure you bring your Mary Jane, and personal lighter
We keep that fire, fire baby, baby
Krayzie, faded, we blaze shit all day
When we rumble, uh oh
We just like animals out the jungle
Make em fall, collapse, stumble, and fumble, just like drunk hoes

Biz got the extra green and nicotine and Krayzie off that sin
Me and Wish just got to the club
And man they better let us in
Cause we got cheese to spend

That's believin' that you bitches is thugs

I'm not that nigga
To floss, baggin' up what my shit costs

Trickin' dough just to stick dick to a hoe

You catch slippin' at the bar or the club
I'll prolly got my glock off safety
Cocked then pop it, now what? Now what?

Not the nigga
To bow down to the law
I'm not that nigga
To snitch and I'm not that nigga you saw

I'm not that nigga
To switch, I keep it hard to the core
I'm not that nigga
They say they saw deep down at the store

I'm not that nigga
Takin' shorts or losses all for my profit
I'm not that nigga
That's gon' give it up 'til somebody stop me

Lockin' these groupie hoes all up in my fangs

So don't ask if I wanna battle with rappin'

Shit, we done come up a long way
We crept and we came, we did our thing, just like the song say
Nigga's been talkin about us like it's Bone Day
They say "them nigga's my nigga's ain't kickin it no more."
They say we all went solo, "nigga's ain't even speakin no more"... You sure?
Nigga don't they know y'all been my dogs since back in the day. (Yep)
We been through some rough times, but never enough to make us break up
Besides, Bone is a business. Even if we didn't kick it, nigga this is business
So quit all that beef and come get this cheese
Nobody really been knowin the drama we done seen
Like my nigga Flesh in jail, stressin in that cell
And we been strugglin nigga, so we might spot ya with some bling bling, and pull a glock
Thuggish, ruggish nigga's, probably heard about us runnin up, checkin these busta's
Actin like they ain't gonna respect the Thugs, muthafuckas
We ain't givin a fuck no more, we get smashed and play with the dough
Kickin ass just so that you know, for the money we goin for broke

(Krayzie)
I don't waste my time without no dollar sign
If you ain't talkin 'bout no paper would you stay outta mine
And don't be tryin to test my patience cause I do pack a nine

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard,

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery

tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin crazyyyy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later.

If they bring me down
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done

You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame

Hey, wooo, ooooh, hey yeah, oooh now
If I had one wish
That wish would be clear
That I would not have to go
That I could stay here
And although it hurts me
To leave you all alone
Just know I'll come back to you
For now I am gone
Gone, for now I am gone (For now I am gone, for now I am gone,
for now I am gone, for now I am.gone )

When I'm dead and gone don't even worry
Don't mourn me too long death-a get ya discouraged
Keepin' your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin'
I know it for certain if I'm really restin' in heaven
No need for you to fear don't cry
‘Cause death won't forever have a grip on our life
So I'm-a be coming big?(bet) ready for the last shine
‘Cause I am a believer that I'll see a resurrection
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin', no drippin', no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in peace 'til I prevail
It's just a temporary lay down I won't forever stay down
So keep me in your memory don't let me fade out
I'll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong I'm gone, gone, long gone

If I had one wish
That wish would be clear

I steady be thinkin' now that if I change my daily thang.
Nigga, don't hang with the phony busta niggas, only roll with thugstas, killas.
Beat 'em and gut 'em.
Me stick 'em.
Me stuck 'em.
We murdered them every time, now.
Bodies be drug off in dumpsters, execution double-nine style.
Hey!
Say, "
Give it up to the niggas who steady be slangin' that llello, bankroll." When the po-po roll, that's when you lay low.

We had to get 'em up with two guns, runnin' side by side with #1.
Bet I won't drop my gauge on when the po-po chase.
If they catch me barehanded, I'm done.
Rip's gripping the six-shot pump, so spill it.
Copper lettin' the lead off.
Copper thought that he had me caught.
Little Layzie blew his head off.
Get 'em up, and get up.
The bullets, they start to get lit up. #1 best start duckin' with a gun already buckin'.
We split up.
Bust a left on the double-glock and, where the fiends roll up for rocks, and this perfect getaway from the pigs when I peel, and I hit the fence and rippin' up the trench, and I'm bailin' while they trailin'.
Better in hell than in a cell, and ain't no tellin' where them copper be dwellin'.
One had spotted me, picked up a piece and shot at me, but I practice what I preach, so see the two slugs up in his body?--Got him!
Run with smoke comin' from the barrel of me gun.
Hit the bend.
Oh, what a dumb-dumb, I got yum-yummed on a dead end.
They set in then they lead in.
They wanted
me up in a coffin.
Cops from everywhere was yellin' and wailin'.

Needin' me money, know he's up tonight
See niggas can't stand us
So they label us scandalous

And if them runnin' off with-a-me cash

Nigga muthafucka po po
Gotta hit 'em with the fo' fo'

Don't be fuckin' with my money
Nigga, no
See when Krayzie pull the pump, then I kill 'em all
Pump slugs

When blood hit the wall, watch 'em fall
Now, dog, who ya gonna call?
Puttin' niggas in the coffin where they probably better off, and
Leathaface is not a punk-bitch
So a nigga just can't fuck me

Nigga better have me cash or I kill his whole family
When the twelve gauge pump blast
Now, test me
Never ever let a nigga ride
When he think he fin to slide, pump him in the spine
Get him for the money

Nigga tried to play me and dash
And that's why me thugs should put slugs in that ass
They telly and me never want to see no
Oh jealous muthafucka tried to keep a nigga's ends low

If he scared to smoke a primo
Gotta go whether fiends in the clique that's a no no
Gotta make that money, man
Gimme all my change

It's a murder thang, now
Even in the dummy game, niggas comin' up slain for collectin' they claim
Now, Leathaface, me pick up me gauge, grab the mask
And, nigga, me blast, so ya better respect us
When you see the bill collector rippin'
Killin' niggas for that mad money thang

Niggas steady payin' them dues, runnin' with trues
Nothin' to lose, everything to prove
Little thug from the C-Town, never caught sleepin'
Always on the come up creepin', runnin' this shit, now

Puttin' that Bone down
Gotta let a nigga know for the love of cheese, movin' thangs in the '95
Rollin' with Ruthless, thuggin' with my niggas from the Clair

Looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, "well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me."

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won’t budge
Grudge, because there’s no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo

And we pray and we pray

A nigga that always at my city with me, now, who was that nigga they put in the plastic?
Nigga that thought he could bang. That nigga's stuck. That nigga's blasted
They got my man from the Land. Never ran, I step with deadly men.
If ya come a little bit closer, I can turn you into sand.
Now follow me, now roll, stroll down to Cleveland.
We thuggin', we theivin', we put it in deep, and the blood is seepin'.
Got niggas in alleys, fuck niggas in badges. We say bang!
Eighty-eight through ten-five—my clique. St. Clair ain't shit to fuck with.
Pumpin', Krayzie be bumpin', dumpin' the bloody body.
Me never knew one that could flow with the tongue. We comin' to shoot up your posse.
My niggas, they comin' up out the woods, to get the goods.
Krayzie be thug, and want to die, that's from comin' up in my hood.
We killas. Get a gat, pap, pap, clack back me gun, bust one, they done.
Cleveland is where we from. Hearts, thugs have none.

High techs and khakis when jackin', sawed-off, there's really no place to run.
Niggas get vicious with my clique is. Even the bitches carry guns. [*2]

Tryin' to blood some souls, with that nine shot

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was O.K.
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry

So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
