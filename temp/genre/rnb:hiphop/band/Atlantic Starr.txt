I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless
There's nothing I can do

Cupid, he must have
Shot me with his arrow
When I first saw your face
Cause I, I been floating
On a cloud ever since
Girl, I'm just a hopeless case

The first time that I held you
I knew that it was just
A matter of time before
I did what comes naturally when
A pretty girl blows your mind

I think about you
In the middle of the day
Thinking how much I love you
And if everything's okay

Can't wait to hug you
And squeeze you, oh, so tight
Then make such good love to you
You'll be hanging on for dear life

I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless and

You hit the spot that turn me on
Boy you turn me on, full power
My wheels are turnin' fast and strong
And there's no way to turn me off

What have you done to my body
Where have you taken my mind
I feel so different
I'm a brand new girl
Uh... boy, your love is "on time"
You have created a monster in me

She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, “She's hot”
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

I've gotta go, and it's not because I don't love you

But the reason is just plain and simple
You see, girl, I'm not in love with you
I never had it and I guess I never will
Because you see, I can't get over my first love

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love

You'll meet someone that will pay
Attention to you everyday
And I might as well be true to myself
'Cause I'll never get used to no one else

You've been so kind to treat me so fine

You say you got to get away, to find yourself

Now lady can't you tell
(It's written all over my face)

My days and nights would be a living hell
(If you go away)

So think about the misery
(That you gonna put me through)

Goodbye, doesn't mean a thing with you and I
Or love has stood through all the test of time (yes it has)
If you're planning to leave me behind
Let me put one more thing on your mind

If you ever need me baby
Send for me
I'm just a telephone call away

Here we are, just the two of us together
Takin' this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let 'em know, no, no, no
We can't leave a trace

Hey, there mister
So it seems again we meet
The first time we met it was crazy
You swept me off my feet

I still imagine your lips, boy
Kissin' me here and there
Ooh, and if my hands could touch your body
They'd caress you everywhere

I want you to love me down, oh
Let's go for what we know
Hold me so tight
Then love me some more

Fine, fine fella
Where do I begin
I guess I should start by tellin' you, sugar
That you're the perfect 10

She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, “She's hot”
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

And something's come between us
To turn the fire cold
Thoughts that chase you in the night

Silently the storm
The life from in your eyes
And I remain alone, no matter
Who may try and take your place

And I'll remember you
The dreams we could of dreamed
The tears I should have seen
We used to say forever

But I'll remember you
Your pure and simple heart
Your shadows painted dark
I will always love you
I'll remember you

Wonderin' if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me

Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

There's nothing I can do

Cupid, he must have
Shot me with his arrow
When I first saw your face
Cause I, I been floating
On a cloud ever since
Girl, I'm just a hopeless case

The first time that I held you
I knew that it was just
A matter of time before
I did what comes naturally when
A pretty girl blows your mind

I think about you
In the middle of the day
Thinking how much I love you
And if everything's okay

Can't wait to hug you
And squeeze you, oh, so tight
Then make such good love to you
You'll be hanging on for dear life

I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you

Or anything like that
But the reason is just plain and simple
You see, girl, I'm not in love with you
I never had it and I guess I never will
Because you see, I can't get over my first love

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love

You'll meet someone that will pay
Attention to you everyday
And I might as well be true to myself
'Cause I'll never get used to no one else

We both know that we should not be together

Both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah

We can't let 'em know, no, no, no

There was something special
Inside of you
You awakened my passion,
And my curiosity
You were so sincere
I knew you'd be there for me

You gave me joy
That I never knew
You were sent here to love me
Cause I needed you
You help me get through
The worst times in my life
You shared my sadness,
My pain, my strive

Whenever I dreamed
The impossible dreams
You assured me that
They would come true
(they would come true)
You stayed in my corner
No matter what life would bring
And I pledged my love to you____oo

She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, “She's hot”
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

This song is just a simple little message
There's no heavy thing
It's just a mere reminder for those of us who
Sometimes forget just how good we are

Life is something we pretend to take for granted
We've gotta it so good that we're hard to satisfy
It would be so nice if we lead towards appreciation
It's not hard if just we try

You should tell the child that only has bread and butter
That some folks have no bread at all
And the man that has no fortune
That hasn't still found someone to love
He should stand just as tall

That's why I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky

Didn't fulfil my needs

I know everyone's got their needs
Oh but somehow what I wanted
Overruled my needs I was living
In a fantasy
All I needed was to see

Baby, you know the nights are forever without you
And I'm plannin' to make up for lost time

So hold me don't let go of me
Let your love flow like never before
Seemed it's been a lifetime
But you are worth waiting for
Even after you give me your love

Give me more and more and more
And more and more I'll take all that you have
Give me more and more and more
And more and more
'Cos I never get enough of your love
Yeah, yeah

She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, “She's hot”
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

I remember gazing on this quiet night
The stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me

Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

I've gotta go, and it's not because I don't love you
Or anything like that
But the reason is just plain and simple
You see, girl, I'm not in love with you
I never had it and I guess I never will
Because you see, I can't get over my first love

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love

You'll meet someone that will pay
Attention to you everyday
And I might as well be true to myself
'Cause I'll never get used to no one else

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
...

Oh what a wonderful world this could be
If we all opened up our eyes to see
That love is what we all need right now
Then we all could come together some way somehow

My door is open wide, no matter who you are
You can come get warm inside
Cuz I need you, just as you need me,
And there's a way to show it, oh love is the key

It may take some time, but we can start by being kind,
To our neighbors in each and every land
And hope that in return they would be concerned

Anything you want I'll give it to you
Cos all my love your entitled to
All my love and nothing less
You deserve the best…
If you dream of a castle I'll build it for you
Work day and night till you say I'm through
I'll fill your life with happiness
You deserve the best…
Darling you deserve the best

My heart is filled with so much love
And I need someone I can call my own
To fall in love, that's what everyones dreaming of
I hold this feeling oh so strong

Life is too short to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you, you will care for me
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love

You know I wont forget the times we shared together
Holding hands and walking in the park
Sometimes well have to do it all again
We were so happy then, I have no regrets
Cant you tell from the look on my face
That I love you more today

The first time I looked into your eyes, I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away

Now lady can't you tell

My days and nights would be a living hell

So think about the misery

Goodbye, doesn't mean a thing with you and I
Or love has stood through all the test of time (yes it has)
If you're planning to leave me behind
Let me put one more thing on your mind

If you ever need me baby
Send for me
I'm just a telephone call away

She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, “She's hot”
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

I remember gazing on this quiet night
The stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me

Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

Can't believe this mess I'm in
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Got my heart spread too thin
Lately the strain has been showing

I need a new direction
Don't wanna share my affection

One lover, one lover at a time
That's enough for me
One lover, one lover at a time
You're all I need

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

My phone is ringing off the wall
Get confused which lover is calling
I can't take this anymore
I saw you and I started falling

You are my new direction

I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless
There's nothing I can do

Cupid, he must have
Shot me with his arrow
When I first saw your face
Cause I, I been floating
On a cloud ever since
Girl, I'm just a hopeless case

The first time that I held you
I knew that it was just
A matter of time before
I did what comes naturally when
A pretty girl blows your mind

I think about you
In the middle of the day
Thinking how much I love you
And if everything's okay

Can't wait to hug you
And squeeze you, oh, so tight
Then make such good love to you
You'll be hanging on for dear life

I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless and

She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, “She's hot”
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

Closer than close
Let's get closer
Closer than most, well, yeah

Totally involved, well
You make my whole world revolve, yeah
Well, it feels so right
And I know I'm hooked for life
Infinite, endlessly, yeah

If you wanna know how long our love will last

And after we've been through

If my heart isn't in it,

If my heart wasn't in it,

The stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me

Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

Thank you for all the love you've given
I'll be in debt to you forever

I was down and out, nowhere to turn to
No one to tell about my fears
Lovesick, ready to lose my mind
And about to drown in my own tears

In my life, I've always gone through changes
Every love I had would never last
Then you came along and you changed my situation
Now all my pain is in the past

Then I want to thank you for all the love you've given
Just when I needed it so bad
I'll be in debt to you forever
You're the greatest love I ever had

Love was just a game as far as I was concerned
I never could hold it in my hands
Ooh, just when I would think that it was for real
It was a mirage in the burning sand, oh

I saw you and I started falling

You are my new direction

I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless
There's nothing I can do

Cupid, he must have
Shot me with his arrow
When I first saw your face
Cause I, I been floating
On a cloud ever since
Girl, I'm just a hopeless case

The first time that I held you
I knew that it was just
A matter of time before
I did what comes naturally when
A pretty girl blows your mind

I think about you
In the middle of the day
Thinking how much I love you
And if everything's okay

Can't wait to hug you
And squeeze you, oh, so tight
Then make such good love to you
You'll be hanging on for dear life

I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless and

I've gotta go, and it's not because I don't love you
Or anything like that
But the reason is just plain and simple
You see, girl, I'm not in love with you
I never had it and I guess I never will
Because you see, I can't get over my first love

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love

You'll meet someone that will pay
Attention to you everyday
And I might as well be true to myself
'Cause I'll never get used to no one else

You've been so kind to treat me so fine

It's a fragile situation
It could fall apart at any time
And none would be the wiser
'Cept you and I

It seems that we stopped talking
like we're afraid to disagree
And after we've been through
Can we still be that naive

CHORUS
If my heart isn't in it,
why can't you tell me so
If my heart wasn't in it,
I'd have gone long ago
If your heart isn't in it

Here we are, just the two of us together
Takin' this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes
(HIM)
I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let 'em know, no, no, no
We can't leave a trace
(BOTH)

Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let go, no, no
'Cause we love each other so

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

You're taking too much time to make up your mind
Either you love me or you don't
And all the other girls in your crazy mixed up world
You said you'd drop them, but you know you won't

Sometimes I think about forgetting you
But it's so, so hard to make that choice
'Cuz boy with you, I go to to seventh heaven
Just by the sound of your voice

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

Can't believe this mess I'm in
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Got my heart spread too thin
Lately the strain has been showing

I need a new direction
Don't wanna share my affection

One lover, one lover at a time
That's enough for me
One lover, one lover at a time
You're all I need

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

My phone is ringing off the wall
Get confused which lover is calling
I can't take this anymore
I saw you and I started falling

You are my new direction

(Ooh... hoo...) Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over (Yeah)
Try and luck might come your way (Your way)

Here I am on a cloud
If you want me, take the chance, cry "Love" out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting Cupid's loving arrow, you just might try

But don't miss me
Take your time and aim
‘Cause you've only got one chance
I think you better touch

Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover
And luck might get you over (Ooh)
Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over
Try and luck might come your way

Like the wind, I am free

Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see

(Verse 1:)
I remember gazing on this quiet night
The stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me

Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

(Chorus:)
Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see

(Verse 2:)

Girl you are to me
All that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life
To you always

A love like yours is rare
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way
For always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever
It will be you and me

Ooh, your like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one

A simple touch of your hand,
And everything is right.
The gentle way you look at me,
When we kiss goodnight.
You've given me the freedom no other love has known
And now I thank you girl, thank you girl

The countless ways you've touched my heart
Is more than I can say
The beauty that you've shown to me
takes my breath away
A picture perfect painting, that's what our love is
And yes I need you so, and now I know

ooooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
a work of art it's true
