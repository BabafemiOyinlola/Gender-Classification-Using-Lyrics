I'm gonna put it out there.
Lay it on the line. And even if it breaks my heart.
I'm giving it a try.
Not waiting fot tomorrow confessing it today
So baby here it goes I'm out of time.
It's do or die.

I wanna be your baby
Won't you be my man?
I wanna be you soldier
When you're too weak to stand.
I wanna be your baby,

Since I've been gone, I wonder who
Who's been lovin' you
Been so long, just tell me
If romance is still the same

Now if you feel lonely, it's a mutual feelin'
I know what's on your mind
Don't let temptation get next to you
Girl, think before you move

You know I care
But there's one thing
I really want to know

Who's lovin' you?
I really want to know

Put all your men in a average city
Had a share of problems don't you know
Just the same the city had too

Time after time, my mama told
? There's a lotta things that you know
But there's a whole lot more you need to know?

? Money, have your own
Friends, just for fun
Drugs, don't indulge
Sex with the right person?

? Work all your day
Crime does not pay
Love don't apply

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Got myself a roommate, and Walter was his name
He liked to play strange games
He had a certain hobby, he always liked to do
He thought it was so cool
He started making money, but couldn't pay the rent
It didn't make too much sense
So I tried to ask him nicely, when he planned to pay
He said, "I doubt it'll be today"

Hey little Walter

Pain, how I wish that things had never to change
Playing with hearts is such a hazardous game
Hoping we can work things out back the same
Come back and love the pain away

Tried my best not to call for you, babe
It only makes things worse
You seem to think whenever I come around
There's something on my mind

Well, if you ever really took some time, girl
And try and figure me out
Girl, if I had a dime for every time
That you tried to love me back
I think I'd be rich

But I can't stand the pain

Always thought I had a little sexy way
Of picking women up, fellas
But she was kinda different, guess you'd say risky
And that's what caught my attention

These sights on prying eyes, strong mind
She came onto me
How was I to know that she was only fifteen?
Cute smile, style and grace, sure looked right to me
Now I fell a victim of a 261.5

Hanging out in B-Town, thought I'd chill out
And find myself a legal judger
I'm in a position, must get worked out
Now I fell a victim of a 261.5

Girl, I'm sick and tired of crying over you
You know sometimes
I run outta tears from my eyes crying over you
I know you may not believe that
See but I swear that I do

There's been other times you had some other guys
And all the guys before had the same things in mind
It wasn't they had dear love, was a temporary love
Girl, what I had for you was a thing from above

But, I'm not gonna cry for you
I'm not gonna cry for you, oh no
I'm not gonna cry for you
I'm not gonna cry for you, oh no

I'm not gonna cry for you
 (I've been crying for much too long)
I'm not gonna cry for you
I'm not gonna cry for you
I'm not gonna cry for you

All alone on Sunday night, I try to hold it in

It never rains in southern California

Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side

For us to be together

Oh it may be cold on the east coast

Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind
And so, you call me your friend but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

Something for the dance floor

It's going down like this forever
And a day

Now what you hear is not a drag
'Cause Mr. DJ Quik got a brand new bag
But first I gotta bang bang
A boogie for the boogie
To the rhythm of the ghettoey streets
Check it out now
You trying to give me some Eight Ball
But no way
I'd rather have a Mimosa
With Crystal and O.J., yeah
Just a little something bubbly and tingly
To have me walking around naked
But wait a second

The function's on
Around midnight
What time is it
Are you inside
Available
To come and play
Give me a clue
So I don't have to
Look for you

Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down
In my black Chevrolet
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down

Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was meant for you)
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was made to groove)
Here we are in the room together

Holding hands and it's gonna get better
And I know that you're in the mood
So put your purse down and take off your jacket
Oh girl it's about to get nasty

And DJ Quik
You didn't think we could flip it on yo ass, huh?
Something for the dance floor
In a real way
It's going down like this forever
And a day

Now what you hear is not a drag
'Cause Mr. DJ Quik got a brand new bag
But first I gotta bang bang
A boogie for the boogie
To the rhythm of the ghettoey streets
Check it out now
You trying to give me some Eight Ball
But no way
I'd rather have a Mimosa
With Crystal and O.J., yeah
Just a little something bubbly and tingly
To have me walking around naked
But wait a second

The function's on
Around midnight
What time is it
Are you inside
Available
To come and play
Give me a clue
So I don't have to
Look for you

Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down
In my black Chevrolet
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down

Spendin' all my time trying to show how I feel when there is so much I can do.
Oh, I wanna please you. (Yeah.)
You say you care for me, but you don't act that way.

I've been penalized too
Working with some fools
Everyday from 9 to 5

Now it's time to break the rules
Wear the fancy shoes
About to hit the town tonight

I don't care about the price
If the place is nice
And has a lotta food and drinks

Of course you can't forget about the babes
And if you all behave
About to rock your house tonight

Let's have a good time
Let's break out in the house
Let's have a good time
Turn the whole dull place alive

Let's have a good time
Gotta be at work the next day
Let's have a good time
Party all night anyway

It feels good to break the rules
Forget about the fools
I had to see the next few days

No one cares about the times
They ought to fill the wine

I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait till I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
Girl you know the rest 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...

Oh it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

Hey, I think it's time for me to meet a new friend.
And it's just so strange, I've been seeing you everyday now
Well, not actually "seeing" you
But I wish I could be with you
And I know that time waits for no one
And I feel today is a very special day
So today, I think I'll walk over to you and say these words.

Hey baby, what's your name and number?
Do you think that I can come over?
Or maybe we can meet at the corner store?
Any time of the day is alright,
I believe in love at first sight
I hope we can become the best of friends

I care
I care for you, girl
I care
And I know that I care
You know I care
I care for you, girl
I care
I care
I care
You know I care
I care wooooo

Let's touch and see if this can work out
I feel a movement without a doubt
I can see it in your eyes, you can feel it too

Sky is the limit

Hey fellas, wait a minute
And let me tell you a story
About this girl of mine

To tell you all the truth
Nothing I wouldn't do
She's just my natural high

Are you sure that she's your type?
Would you want her by your side?
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told you she's the one

What you told me, that's the truth
Are you sure you're not confused?
 (No fellas, no)
I'll never hold back on her 'coz

Sky is the limit
And if you really want it
You put your heart in it
Sky is the limit

Look way up in the sky
Heaven's missing an angel
'Coz I got her here with me now

And yet to say the least
I just want God's leads
And I'm never letting go

I had a girl that I used to see
She's precious and so sweet
Like Velcro she was attached to me

20 hours outta 24
She's always knocking at my door
So I said,? Hey baby, I need some room to breathe?

Please believe, we'll go our seperate ways
Then like the critics, she had something to say

Talk about good times
Talk about bad times
Don't talk about me

Girl, talk about the good times
Talk about the bad times
Don't talk about me

Funny how you accuse me of something
That I know nothing about
Never said I was engaged to you

I never promised you a rose garden
Only said that we could go out
Now you're telling your friends I'm hard on you

Please believe, we'll go our seperate ways
And just like the critics, she always had something to say

Jo-Jo
Jo-Jo
Jo-Jo

Now here's the situation, it's not very clear
Why so many seem to disappear today
There must be an answer, we must find a way
Before we lose another Jo-Jo

Now funny how no one seems to know a thing
Every time somebody comes a missing
Now just like Jo-Jo, if you can hear me
Please give me a sign, let me know you're alright

Are you lonely Jo-Jo out there on your own?
You can always come back, Jo-Jo
Are you lonely Jo-Jo? You're running outta time
Such a crazy world, Jo-Jo

Family situation, it stands very clear
Why so many children choose to leave their homes today

Talkin' 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be lookin' for somebody else
But as time went on I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind
And so, you call me your friend but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Friends and enemies around me everyday
I can't believe half the things they say
Takin' me for granted givin' no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncin' like a bouncin' ball

Got myself a roommate, and Walter was his name
He liked to play strange games
He had a certain hobby, he always liked to do
He thought it was so cool
He started making money, but couldn't pay the rent
It didn't make too much sense
So I tried to ask him nicely, when he planned to pay
He said, "I doubt it'll be today"

Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was meant for you)
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was made to groove)
Here we are in the room together

Holding hands and it's gonna get better
And I know that you're in the mood
So put your purse down and take off your jacket
Oh girl it's about to get nasty

I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait till I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
Girl you know the rest 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...

Oh it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

Talkin' 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be lookin' for somebody else
But as time went on I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind
And so, you call me your friend but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Friends and enemies around me everyday
I can't believe half the things they say
Takin' me for granted givin' no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncin' like a bouncin' ball

Got myself a roommate, and Walter was his name
He liked to play strange games
He had a certain hobby, he always liked to do
He thought it was so cool
He started making money, but couldn't pay the rent
It didn't make too much sense
So I tried to ask him nicely, when he planned to pay
He said, "I doubt it'll be today"

You know what fellas? What?
I wanna get this beat. Pull out them drums loud.
I wanna hear them kickin'.
Kick it so loud they kick 'em way back in Mississippi.
Like that? Aw, yeah, like that.
All you ever give me is the blues.
C' mon fellas, let's do this.

Spendin' all my time trying to show how I feel when there is so much I can do.
Oh, I wanna please you. (Yeah.)
You say you care for me, but you don't act that way.
C'mon, girl, who you trying to fool.
Tell, Dwayne.
Just when I try to fill you what I can do for you, I feel like I'm wasting my time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't see myself without you.
That's why I hang around.
All you ever give me is the blues.

Girl, you know I'm spending all my time pleasing you.

Talkin' 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be lookin' for somebody else
But as time went on I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind
And so, you call me your friend but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Friends and enemies around me everyday
I can't believe half the things they say
Takin' me for granted givin' no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncin' like a bouncin' ball

Lovin' you makes my heart sing a song
Knowin' you makes all my pain go away
Lovin' you makes my heart sing a song
Knowin' you lets me know things are gone

I feel responsible when it comes to you
That means I think that I'm addicted to you
I feel like life has just begun for us, yeah
See, there's no one else in this world
That I would'nt wanna trust

When beauty touches the world
I mean each boy and girl
That means our hearts must grow
Girl, let your feelin's show

Your life will soon come to pass
Our souls will always last
I know my self esteem just tells me

I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait till I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
Girl you know the rest 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...

Oh it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

You're the love of my life
Why do you need to see other guys?
Woman, you're the air that I breathe
When it's cold outside you make me freeze
Playing with my soul is what you do
Guess I've been such a silly fool
I guess I'm losing my mind everyday
Oh, sometimes I can't remember my name

Girl, I know I've got to let go
But I still, still love you so

When I met you, I couldn't believe my eyes
Now I'm with you, life is full of surprise
Never thought we would be holding hands
Tell me something, was this part of your plans

I can't believe how good it felt
I tried to keep it to myself
I know I said I wouldn't tell my friends

Had to tell somebody

El Raton:
Yo no aguanto la gente que me jusga
que el chisme siempre busca (busca)
que estoy acostumbrado si nada te mereces
con estupideces no te quedas en pie
dame una razon para ritirarme para yo callarme
para que acontentarme
camino en las paredes flow parkor
en medio de la jungla like betankour
lejos da los michos vivo a lado a bichos
entre los llantos de viejas y mijos
desde pequeñito mi nombre calladito viaja por los barrios y sus gritos
vuelve a tu cama y prende una un luz yo soy
el demonio que voltea tu cruz mas speed que en speed flow
panico como una bomba dentro bus bus

ti hanno detto che la scena era defunta
ma nell'acciaio batte ancora un cuore come gundam
come Cassano a questa scena do una giunta
il flow miete, come un machete nella giungla
si allunga come Dalsim
la lista degli scazzi, è proporzionale ai traguardi
e se mi chiedi "fra quanti, anni farai, il salto avanti"
so che forse non lo farò mai
ma sto fra i mostri come frankenstein, mister
la mia banda suona live al titty twister
vieni stasera sister, con i tuoi amici hipster
le ossa gli faranno crock come i cipster
ho mille, rime che ti incollano alla sedia tipo un thriller
rap frank miller, tu fai ridere ben stiller,

Since I've been gone, I wonder who
Who's been lovin' you
Been so long, just tell me
If romance is still the same

Now if you feel lonely, it's a mutual feelin'
I know what's on your mind
Don't let temptation get next to you
Girl, think before you move

You know I care
But there's one thing
I really want to know

Who's lovin' you?

Had a share of problems don't you know

Time after time, my mama told
? There's a lotta things that you know
But there's a whole lot more you need to know?

Friends, just for fun
Drugs, don't indulge
Sex with the right person?

Got myself a roommate, and Walter was his name
He liked to play strange games
He had a certain hobby, he always liked to do
He thought it was so cool
He started making money, but couldn't pay the rent
It didn't make too much sense
So I tried to ask him nicely, when he planned to pay
He said, "I doubt it'll be today"

Pain, how I wish that things had never to change
Playing with hearts is such a hazardous game
Hoping we can work things out back the same
Come back and love the pain away

Tried my best not to call for you, babe
It only makes things worse
You seem to think whenever I come around
There's something on my mind

Well, if you ever really took some time, girl
And try and figure me out
Girl, if I had a dime for every time
That you tried to love me back
I think I'd be rich

But I can't stand the pain

Always thought I had a little sexy way
Of picking women up, fellas
But she was kinda different, guess you'd say risky
And that's what caught my attention

These sights on prying eyes, strong mind
She came onto me
How was I to know that she was only fifteen?
Cute smile, style and grace, sure looked right to me
Now I fell a victim of a 261.5

Hanging out in B-Town, thought I'd chill out
And find myself a legal judger
I'm in a position, must get worked out
Now I fell a victim of a 261.5

I run outta tears from my eyes crying over you

See but I swear that I do

There's been other times you had some other guys
And all the guys before had the same things in mind
It wasn't they had dear love, was a temporary love
Girl, what I had for you was a thing from above

But, I'm not gonna cry for you

Just a little something bubbly and tingly
To have me walking around naked
But wait a second

Around midnight
What time is it
Are you inside
Available
To come and play
Give me a clue
So I don't have to
Look for you

Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
