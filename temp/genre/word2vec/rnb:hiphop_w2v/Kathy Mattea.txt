A song for you this evening, and it's not to make you sad, Or for adding to the sorrow of a troubled Northern land. But lately I've been thinking, and it just won't leave my mind. I'll tell you now of two good friends. They were both good friends of Mine. Isaac Scott from Derry, he lived just across the fields. A great man for the music and the dancing and the reels. MacDonald came from South Armagh to court young Agnes fair. It was then we'd meet on Ryan Road, and laughter filled the air. Now, Isaac, he was Protestant and Sean was Catholic born. But it never made a difference, for their friendship it was strong. And sometimes in the evening when we heard the sound of drums, We said "War won't divide us, we will always be as one. For the land our fathers plow in, the soil it is the same. And the places where we say our prayers have just got different Names." ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
