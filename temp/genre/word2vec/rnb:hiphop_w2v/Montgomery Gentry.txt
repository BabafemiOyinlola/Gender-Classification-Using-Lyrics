Sometimes I think what turned her on, Was my old broke down boots. She wanted her a real cowboy, It was a phase she was goin' through. Not one week after she moved in, I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue. Brought home a bottle of pink chablis, Poured out my best home brew. I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls, As she packed her things to leave. She changed her mind when she couldn't change me. She changed direction, headed out west. Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess. Her dark brown hair went to blonde, And her pretty blue eyes went to green. She changed everything when she couldn't change me.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Wanna know what Uncle Joe thinks? We oughta take them tanks and guns and bombs And load them planes and get them boys and girls on home  That gets my dad mad, boiling red Revved up vein poppin' outta his head Sayin' you pull out now, you shame the ones Who fought and bled and came home dead  For your right to gripe, left to right Then momma shouts, boys hush your mouth Grab a plate and bow your heads And be thankful when the grace is said 'cause...  That's the thing about America You can dream or do or say what you wanna You can run it down if you can back it up You can burn the flag or be the man Who takes a stand, says I'll be damned ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I've spent my whole life Somewhere on the other side Of that line You ain't ever s'posed to cross Running with my demons chasing What they said was freedom Swore I'd never leave 'em No matter what the cost  I've got a wild side Forged by the wild fires of hell Yeah that old devil knew me well  Till I heard you call my name Saw you reaching through the flames With one touch you broke these chains That's been dragging me down God knows I'm no beginner When it comes to being a sinner ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
My old man's backhand used to land Hard on the side of my head I just learned to stay out of his way There been street fights, blue lights, long nights With the world sittin' on my chest It just showed me how much I can take Hard times, bad luck Sometimes life sucks  That's alright I'm okay It ain't nothin' but another day But only God knows where I'd be If you ever stop lovin' me  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You don't have to holler, And we don't have to fight. We can settle all this, right here Right now, tonight  No need to call no lawyer You don't have to pack no bags It's obvious, all you want is Half more than your half  I see here on this paper You wrote what you want down Want me to sign over What was ours is all yours now  Take the house that my sweat built ya' Here's the keys to both the cars I'll do you up the title to my ole Harley in the barn  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
