Well, I came in late again last night Really, it was this morning I had my alibi down pat I was gonna be charming  But the locks were all changed I was stuck outside With a key that no longer fit There was a note on the door That said, adios, sayonara Goodbye, this is it  I don't think she's in love anymore She's hanging up her telephone And locking her door I don't think she wants to Hear anymore of my lying  I don't think she's in love anymore ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Burgers and fries and cherry pies, it was simple and good back then Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end Making our love with the moon above at the drive in picture show And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know  Changes come and go we've had our share I know Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore All the things we used to say, little things we did each day ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I've taken down all of her pictures I've cleaned out all of her drawers I've painted over the scratches From all of our little wars  I've put away every gift That she ever gave to me Now everything is in its place Except for her memory  And where do I put her memory When it haunts me night and day ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I’m no stranger to loving arms I'm accustomed to lady’s charms You know I didn't just arrive into town You might say I've been around  I've seen the fighter in lover’s eyes I've seen the lost pay in my time I didn't think that there was much I’d missed But let me tell you this  I've never been so loved in all my love I've never felt the way I feel tonight You came along and made my world turn bright ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Walking along, whistling a song, Barefoot and fancy free, A big riverboat, passing us by, she's headed for New Orleans There she goes, disappearing around the bend. Roll on Mississippi; you make me feel like a child again.  A cool river breeze, like peppermint leaves, The taste of it takes me back, Chewin on a straw, torn overalls, A cane pole and old straw hat and muddy river. Just like a long lost friend. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Mountain Of Love Standing on a mountain looking down on a city The way I feel is a dog-gone pity Teardrops are fallin' down the mountainside Many times I've been here and many times I cried We used to be so happy, when we were in love High on a mountain of love Night after night I been standing here alone ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
