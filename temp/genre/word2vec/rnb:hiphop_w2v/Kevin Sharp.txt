(Bob Regan/George Teren)  There's a little voice inside your head That's getting hard to ignore Your pulse is racing and your heart is set What are you waiting for?

(Chris Farren/Gary Burr)  I wrote it down when I was only A young boy of seventeen, a long list of what true love means Now I'm here on the wrong side of lonely 'Cause I never really knew what really matters to me  She don't have to be rich She don't have to be wild She don't have to be seen in the latest style I don't care if she's tough, of just a little bit shy Either one will be fine She just has to be mine  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
We don't talk much, anymore Though I'm dying to call You say it's over, now for sure But for me it isn't over at all I lie awake and struggle every night Though it's less than what it was it's more than I can fight  It's still love And it still has awesome power inside and over me Look inside my heart, it's still love Even though we're not together there's a part of me  That's never gonna change, that's still burning with the flame Even though it's not the same as it was It's still love, to me Still love  I don't know quite who's to blame ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She said I'm not pointing fingers And he said yes you are Cause you wouldn't bring it up if you weren't If I told you I'd be walking Out in the dark night thinking Would you take as truth this alcoholics word I can't change what's done is done But I can tell you this Not a day goes by that I don't curses my self and all my sins And I need you to hold on to while this part of me is dying Though I haven't kicked the demons that haunt me I'm trying, I'm trying She sat down on the floor ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

At the Praire View Motel They've got a swimming pool shaped like the state of Texas And a room with a view On our honeymoon we were learning new dances  I remember my hands were shaking I didn't know what to do and you had to show me And the world just seemed to stand still In that road-side adobe  Two hearts, beating as one Lost in the moon, found by the sun Too soon to know for sure but too late to run  I wanna be scared like that again Feel the wave of emotion come rushing in My trembling lips, the taste of your kiss The touch of our skin ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

It's five o'clock At the Sad Cafe Dinner for one, a table for two Another lonely day She tries to hide the pain But her strong will is just a weak disguise It's there in her eyes She wants to be somebody's baby She wants to be somebody's friend She just needs a choulder to lean on now and then She's no stranger to danger ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
