A bright array of city lights,  As far as I can see,  There great white wave shines through the night,  On lonely guys like me.  The cabaret's and honky tonks,  The flashing signs and lights,  The broken heart to lose itself,  In the glow of city lights.  Lights that say forgive her now,  In a glass of sherry wine,  The lights that offer other girls,  For empty hearts like mine.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
