I thought I'd died and gone to heaven First time she smiled at me She was sittin' there eating watermelon Spitting out the seeds  She's got this thing 'bout roller skatin' Mint chocolate chip ice-cream She's always overdecorating Loves to cause a scene  She's like sunshine, moonshine, Lemon-lime Doritos Snoop Dogg, hot dogs, chili on her fritos More features than a movie theater More sugar than a sweet potato The more I find, the more I discover Sometimes I think she gets it from her mother She's got the gift, but she ain't givin' She's the well & I keep a wishin' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Well the day it ends when the sun comes up And it starts when the sun goes down Out on the backroads and on the back streets Of every farm and factory town There in the world of weekly wage There's always a place out there And the names and the faces are the same everywhere  Well the room is full it's a Friday night We all wanna hear Louie Louie Been a long hard day and a long hard life And this is how we make it through it It's a blue collar place a red blooded crowd Tonight everything's all right In honky tonk America  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Me and Junior, Sunny and Steve hangin' at the fillin' station And drinkin' Cokes out by the grease rack a week before graduation Telling lies 'bout the girls we knew perpetuating backseat legends Four years worth of near misses too numberous for me to mention  Shootin' the bull in an old cowtown Watching grass grow as the sun goes down Cruising Fridays nights at the Dairy Queen Driving 'round and 'round Shootin' the bull in an old cowtown  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I rolled out of bed, grabbed a cup of caffeine this morning, Walked out the door, didn't even kiss you goodbye. Hurryin to work, a car pulled out - no warning, In an instant it all, flashed before my eyes. And I'm gonna live the rest of my life,  Like I've got One Day Left To Live, One night Left to Love you, Starting right now, I'm starting all over, Doing what I should do, Should this be my last, Or I've got 100 years, From this day on, I'm gonna live my life, ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
My baby came and got me in her Mama's Cadillac We went parkin' by the river near the honeydew patch She started talkin' 'bout the birds and the bees My mind ran wild with the possibilities Like Rhett and Scarlett climbin' up the stairs We were on our way to heaven in the melons out there  She was the centerfold picture in a country boy's dream Prettiest thing I ever had seen Tupelo honey in a pair of blue jeans The upper Mississippi Delta Cotton County Queen  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
We meet at the Broken Spoke Restaurant and Lounge I lit your cigarette then you wrote your number down. On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart  I didn't see it coming, guess I didn't read the signs I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time. But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor  You took the bed; you took the dishes and the car ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Billy Lawson/Larry Boone)  Well I got a cousin that's twice removed Had a crush on a girl back in school She didn't know it he didn't let it show Now she's married to a banker in El Paso  You gotta swing that hammer And beat that drum Swing that hammer beat that drum Work work work It's a labor of love  Well I once knew a couple from Arkansas ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Well I really look a mess Ever since you left I guess And the grass outside needs mowin' Laundry's stacked up three foot tall But I don't even care at all And I don't know where I'm goin'  Thank God you're gone So you don't see me fall apart Pickin' up the pieces of my shattered broken heart When you left me, my world came down It's a good thing you're not around to see I'm really not that strong ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Little Jolena, a dark haired darlin' Skin of ivory, angel eyes Every man in Louisiana wanted her sweet love But she swore on the Bible, she was all mine  Hey little did I know, she was wild as the bayou Catch a man on a cane pole, hang his heart on the line I thought I could hold her, me oh my oh Little did I know, she had bigger fish to fry  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
How long have we been the very best of friends I've always heard you say, I could tell you anything Oh the times I made you laugh, the times I dried your tears Through the good and bad I've always been right there  An arms length away Right in front of your face This close to your lips, right at your finger tips That one true love, you're dreaming of Darlin' what would you say ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Sammy Kershaw)  Well you broke my heart Then you said goodbye You didn't stick around long Enough to see me cry I tried to get you on the phone But you were long gone Guess I'll just spend a whole bunch Of nights sittin' all alone  Time and time again I would let you back in After foolin' around with Some of my old friends ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You are the love of my life And you are the reason I'm alive And baby, baby, baby When I think of how you saved me I go crazy  I've never known love like this And it fills me with a new tenderness And I know, I know, I know You're in my heart, you're in my soul You're all I can't resist  And I need to tell you The first time I held you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
