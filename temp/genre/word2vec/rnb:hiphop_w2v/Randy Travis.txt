I said one thing I'd never do was care Or hang around for too long anywhere I could always move ahead With nothing left behind Then you started messin' with my mind  This town was just another place to play Have some fun and then be on my way You were just another way for me To pass some time Then you started messin' with my mind ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There may no be a Superbowl in 2083 Cars and trains and video games will all be history The world just keeps on changing, Things come and then they go Nothing lasts forever except one thing I know.  There'll always be a honky tonk With a jukebox in the corner And someone crying in their beer And one old hanger-oner And a lady looking lonely From a losing love affair Yeah. there'll always be a honky tonk somewhere. Yeah, there'll always be a honky tonk somewhere. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You've been too gone, for too long It's too late to come back now It's been so long since you walked out my door Now you're just an old song nobody sings anymore I got a new love and she's a true love But darlin', how could you have known?

Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls We're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball The good times ain't over after all Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls  Well it seems we let the hard times come between us Like a wall around our hearts we couldn't see Hard luck and troubles came rainin' down upon us And they almost got the best of you and me  Once we loved to stay at home and make love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Suppose I called you up tonight And told you that I love you And suppose I said I want to come back home And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson And I'm tired of spending all my time alone  If I told you that I realize You're all I ever wanted And it's killing me to be so far away Would you tell me that you love me too And would we cry together Or would you simply laugh at me and say  I told you so Oh, I told you so ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Gene Pistilli/Larry Henley)  You can throw away my picture, Empty out my dresser drawer Break up all the dishes, change the lock on the door But you can't erase my memory, no matter how you try It don't mean it's over, just because you said goodbye  I'm sorry that I hurt you, but you made me so mad If I don't care about you, why do I feel so bad We're almost out of sugar, and our matches got wet But we ain't out of love yet ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There was Dirty Steve, Charlie, Dick Brewer and Doc, Chavez and Billy the Kid. They all rolled together for a moment in time, believin' in all that they did. Each one was different, but they all were the same, with one common reason in mind The cold hand of justice delivered to all who had shot a good friend from behind... they shot a good friend from behind.  Young guns who were driven by hatred and anger with no way to win in the end, Some would be dyin' and some would be livin', the question remaining was when.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Well, I never felt more like singing the blues 'Cause I never thought That I'd ever lose, your love dear Why did you do me this way  Well, I never felt more like crying all night 'Cause everything's wrong And nothing is right, without you You got me singing the blues  Well, the moon lit stars no longer shine The dream is gone out from my mind There's nothing left for me to do But cry-y-y over you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I'll just turn away there's no need to watch her leavin' And I don't want to let her see me cry And a part of me that's breakin' Is the part that has been takin' her for granted And that's why she said goodbye.

Since the day I was led to temptation And in weakess did let your love down I have prayed that with time and compassion You'd come around  And I keep waiting for you to forgive me And you keep saying you can't even start And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown To the hard rock bottom of your heart To the hard rock bottom of your heart  Now, this home we have built is still standing ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck, and he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck. And his teeth were gone, but what the heck, I thought that he walked on water.  He said he was a cowboy when he was young. He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun. And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,-- and I thought that he walked on water.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

A baby in a manger, the town of Bethlehem The wise men had the heart to know He was the great I Am They crossed the desert many miles to kneel down at His feet The star that led them seemed to tell them what had come to be  The Son's gonna rise and shine Make the lame walk, the deaf talk, and give sight back to the blind.

A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico. One was headed for vacation, one for higher education And two of them were searchin' for lost souls. That driver never ever saw the stop sign. An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime.  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows.

They took Your commandments Off the schoolhouse walls They say it's a crime To even pray within the halls But bless the child that lets You in And knows without a doubt Once You live inside a heart, They can't take You out  We are soldiers of the cross We've been found to reach the lost In city streets, down country roads We take You with us everyday, And everywhere we go ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
