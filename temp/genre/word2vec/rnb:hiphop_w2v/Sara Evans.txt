Ooh yeah  I love the way you wear those worn out blue jeans Walkin' all around in the big sunshine Baby let me believe that you're perfect At least for a little while  You don't have to tell me what you're thinkin' You can keep all that to yourself Baby we got such a good thing goin' Don't show me that you're someone else  I'm acting as if This blue sky's never gonna rain down on me I'm telling myself This true love's never gonna leave me lonely ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow About the places that I'd like to see I say, friend, do you think I'll ever get there Oh, but he just stands there smilin' back at me  So I confessed my sins to the preacher About the love I've been prayin' to find Is there a brown-eyed boy in my future, yeah And he says, girl, you've got nothin' but time  But how do you wait for heaven?

If you don't take me to Paris on a lover's getaway, it's alright, it's alright If I'd rather wear your t-shirt than a sexy negligee, it's alright, It's alright Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit It's kinda nice to know that it  Doesn't have to be perfect Maybe every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectly Love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams Honey, if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me  If your mother doesn't like the way I treat her baby boy, it's alright, it's alright ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You say your every day Is a bad dream that keeps repeatin' Maybe you should've thought about that When you were cheatin'  How do you like that furnished room, the bed, the chair, the table The TV picture comes and goes, too bad you don't have cable How do you like that paper plate, and those pork-n-beans you're eatin' Maybe you should've thought about that When you were cheatin' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

"That cracks me up!" ...laughter...  Back when I was young Couldn't wait to grow up Get away and get out on my own And lookin' back now Ain't it funny how I've been tryin' to get back home Yeah  When my low self-esteem needs a man-lovin' me And I find me a perfect catch Then I see my friends havin' wild weekends And I don't wanna be quite so attached Just as soon as I get what I want I get unsatisfied Good is good, but could be better  I keep lookin', I keep lookin' for I keep lookin' for somethin' more I always wonder what's on the other side ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I can't imagine, any greater fear Than waking up, without you here And though the sun, would still shine on My whole world, would all be gone But not for long  If I had to run If I had to crawl If I had to swim a hundred rivers Just to climb a thousand walls Always know that I would find a way To get to where you are There's, no place, that far ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
