From 20, 000 feet I saw the lights below me Twinkling just like Christmas We descended slowly  And the curve of the world passed With all of that flying Above the mighty ocean And now we all are arriving  Grab the carry on baggage Join the herd for the mad run Take a place in the long line Where does every one come from?  As we shuffle on forward As we wait for inspection Don't be holding that line up At the end lies redemption Oh Oh, Hey Hey, Ah Ah  Now I'm stamped and I'm waved through ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
These are your instructions Should you choose to follow Sit down with pen and paper Begin with something hollow Like the last words that he offered No kind of explanation They only take up space here You do not need to save them  Open up the closet Find his winter coat there Check inside the pockets Find a crumpled note there It says "milk and Sunday paper" And a heart smudged in blue ink Fold it up and box it before you've time to think  Sundays are the hardest Avoid familiar back roads Erase the old phone numbers ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Back when I believed in luck And stones & crosses I'd put a coin found on the street Towards cosmic losses And passing graveyards in a car Tracing every falling star Luck was never very far from childhood causes  And pennies kissed with wishes arced into the fountains And time was said to heal all pain And hope move mountains And all that could befall a heart Or break this perfect life apart ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There's another home somewhere There's another glimpse of sky There's another place unlearned And a face not memorized  There's another quilt of green Where the trees throw down their shade There's another way to lean Into the wind unafraid  There's another life out there Beyond your quiet room Use dead reckoning ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There's a big white house on a leafy street On a summer's day of 1963 Station wagons parked in the drive Dents in the fender and wood on the side There's kids and dogs and instamatic cubes squinting hard in the sun Not just yet, but one day too They'll be chasing what's already gone  You grow up tall and you grow up tough Trying to never admit not feeling good enough Until you find your passion and you find your way Just trying to make it unscathed through every day ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Grief rides quietly on the passenger side Unwanted company on a long, long drive It turns down the quiet songs and turns up the din It goes where you go, it's been where you've been  And pushing your empty cart mile after mile Leaves you weeping in the wilderness Of the supermarket aisle And in the late night kitchen light it sits in a chair Watching you pretend that it's not really there  But it is, so it is and you ask ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I tried going west where the sky meets the sun Where the edge of the world's always been As far from this place as a girl gets to run When her reasons to stay have worn thin  Out there the days were so bright and so blue Yet I missed all my thunder and rain The way a storm punctures a hot afternoon Washing away every stain  When my maps pointed north they were calling for snow To cover all sound and all sight Tell me where on this earth does all that noise go Underneath all of that white ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Don't need much to be happy Four walls and a roof overhead Books and food in my belly Cool sheets upon the bed  A fire that warms up December The sound of a thaw in the eaves Sometimes it's hard to remember How tough we are to please  All in good time Somehow I find Days that still shine with light ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
All of our dreams are laid out and measured Arrows and pins and a rainbow of threads Like hope on a string, sewn into the linings For the courage to face the unknown ahead  My soul companion Out in the world somewhere My soul companion I'll meet you there  I'm packing my compass, trusted and tested My dog-eared maps to study and fold Into a pocket, I'm traveling light now ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I want old love, the kind that takes years To turn to gold, love, burnished and seared On the high wire, by rain, wind and sun With the hard times forgiven and done  I want old love, the kind that seeps in It isn't cold, love, it's never brittle or thin It's the long kiss, it's the curl of a sigh Down a hallway, in the middle of the night  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
We are sitting at a table in a bar in Baltimore It's the last night of December And the room is nearly full And the front door pulls a draft in every time it opens wide And you are telling me a story From another time and life  And the waitress brings our order And we're tucked in mighty close And I feel like we belong among The living and these ghosts And I know that I am dreaming As I memorize each part In the telling lies a reverie In the details lie the heart  Like the folds of summer dresses Like the scent upon my wrist Like the way you played guitar Like a boxer punches with his fist ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You are fading away in pieces and parts Like old china and glass, in fragments and shards Moment by moment, a day at a time By the side of the road, in the dark of the night  You are leaving me here like the seasons will do Leaving nothing behind but I know it was you That walked where I walk now, that stood where I stand Some phantom performing a strange sleight of hand  And the places I see are returning once more ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Heroes and heroines are scarcer than they've ever been So much more to lose than win The distance never greater Way back when they made history  By flyin' planes across the sea Embarkin' on the odyssey You put away the danger  Heaven bless the one who flies A pioneer on frontier skies The world was dark and your only mark Was the light of the northern star  I imagine what was in your eyes The seeds of rust and days gone by Your wings hang in a gallery sky I wonder how you're flyin'  Way out on the western plains ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
