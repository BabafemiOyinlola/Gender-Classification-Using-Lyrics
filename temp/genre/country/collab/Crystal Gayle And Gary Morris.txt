You laid your feelings on the line I never stood a chance We found the perfect love this time Why let little doubt Urn us inside out  What if we fall in love? What if we can't get out? What if we're in too deep? Guess, we both got doubts What if it doesn't last? What if the road gets rough? Only fools ask, 'What if we fall in love?' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I see you standing by the light in the window of my bedroom That old moon has never shined as bright as it's shining now on you I see a new star in the heavens for us tonight I've been waiting for you most of my life  Now that we're together and we're where we belong I can't help but wonder why, why did it take so long  Sometimes it takes too much time to find the right one to say I wanna make you mine, I wanna make you mine Be with you all the time And be the only light in your eyes that ever shines  Sometimes it takes too many roads to reach the right one to say Here's where I wanna be, oh, what you mean to me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

You don't give a show of public affection How do I know if there's still an attraction Don't give a sign its there any longer Goes on and on, I just don't belong here I wanna go where the going good, oh, I wanna go while I still know I could  Wanna give my love, wanna give my love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
