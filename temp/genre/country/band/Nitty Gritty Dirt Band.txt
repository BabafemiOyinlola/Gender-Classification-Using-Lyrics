Merry-go-rounds and burial grounds Are all the same to me. Horses on post and kids and ghosts Are spirits that we ought to set free. Then city slicker pickers got a lot of Slicker licks than me. But ridin' the range and acting strange Is where I want to be.  And I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy I just wanna ride and rope and hoot (hoot!) Well I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy Talkin' 'bout a supernatural country rockin' galoot  Well skinny dippin' and lone star sippin' and steel guitar ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I beg your pardon, mama, what did you say? My mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay. It's not that I'm not interested, you see; Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be.  I think Jamaican in the moonlight. Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night. We got no money, mama, but we can go; We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove.

All alone in a sleepless night Passing time with a runaway moon Talkin' to myself Wishing I was somewhere else It's been too long since I held you girl Twice a thousand miles But my heart won't beat alone I need the love I left behind  Hold back the dawn awhile This will all work out Don't let this dream die There's a fire in the sky It's like the light in your eyes Thinkin' of you And I won't give up till your in my arms ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
In 1814, we took a little trip 'Long with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississipp' We took a little bacon and we took a little beans Caught the bloody British in the town o' New Orleans Fired our guns and the British kept on comin' Wasn't now as many as there was awhile ago Fired once more and they began a runnin' Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico Now we looked down the river and seen the British come Must've been a hundred of them beatin' on a drum Stepping so high they made the bugles ring We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I knew a man, Bojangles and he'd dance for you In worn out shoes. With silver hair and ragged shirt and baggy pants, He did the old soft shoe. He jumped so high, he jumped so high And then he lightly touched down.  I met him in a cell in New Orleans I was - down and out. He looked to me to be the eyes of age As he spoke right out.

Way back in my memory, there's a scene that I recall of a little run down cabin in the woods where my daddy never promised that our blue moon would turn gold but he lay awake nights wishing that it would when the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds. we lived our day to day and plain dirt fashion. with ol' overalls and cotton balls all scrapped across your back, it's hard to make believe ain't nothing wrong but mama kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed and somewhere in between I must have grown ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I've got ripplin' water to wake me To the mornin', my woman and love And tall pine trees are pointing us easily To heaven above  Blue spruce flaming on the grate in the evening Takes the chill away fine Cut the telephone line And the story's the same  There's a worn red chair by the window That we found at a sale down the way When some old women said that they Needed more room for the winter  But people like pulling out the stuffing when they sit down And so it passes the time Cut the telephone line The story's the same  Oh, like a bubble on a windy day I start to flutter when I hear you say ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Sat here by this stony brook Until the grey day turned to dust When up swam a fish with a children's book Thought that I was lost  He was on his way to the salmon hop That's where they go to breed Saw me sitting on this log And thought I'd like to read  The night was cloudy But the moon he found a hole Said that he felt bad for me 'Cause I had no place to go ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I've been looking for a love - someone to hold as I lay sleepin'. I'm not talking 'bout someone who's scared of promises or keeping 'em. I'm just looking for a love to stand the test of time. I've been lookin' for someone to be all mine.  I had too much lonely - I need a one and only. Someone I can care about and call my own. Faithful to tradition - without an intermission. We'll still be together when the kids are grown. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
