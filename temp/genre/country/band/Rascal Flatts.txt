Life's like a road that you travel on When there's one day here and the next day gone Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore We won't hesitate To break down the garden gate There's not much time left today. Yeah  Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long  Through all these cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around I love you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hands  From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There's one more sip in this bottle of wine A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it And it's yours if you want it And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard A real slow dance in the moonlight dark This hand in my pocket Oh baby, just call it Cause it's yours if you want it  And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart That's been waitin' on a girl like you I know it ain't much But it comes alive with every touch Every kiss already feels like you own it Baby it's yours if you want it  Half of this rickety front porch swing Every word of every song I sing My jacket when it's cold ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I don't say what I mean I don't mean what I say It's almost like ain't me that keeps pushing you away How any nights have you laid here with me feeling like I left? Waking up in a stranger's bed Don't know how I got lost Don't know how to get back Don't know how you haven't hit the door with your bags all packed Every morning I hear you pray for the old me instead Of waking up in a stranger's bed  I'm gonna run straight back to us baby No more same old someone else Back to the one you used to love like crazy Maybe, you'll save me from myself When the sun comes around again ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I know you don't mean to be mean to me 'Cause when you want to, you can make me feel like we belong We belong Lately you make me feel like all I am is a back-up plan I say I'm done and then you smile at me and I forget Everything I said  I buy into those eyes And into your lies  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Se que no me conoces lo suficiente, Te habrán dicho que soy un loco y mucho más Pero se, que cuando me miras Y me tienes de frente Algo por mi sientes Y no lo puedes ocultar Llevo tiempo deseando Que estemos hablando Que me des una oportunidad No importa que estén hablando Si tu sientes algo Es el momento y no hay más que hablar Yo te quiero a ti Tú me quieres a mi Aprovecha el momento Me tienes aquí Te cuido hasta morir No te dejaré ahí Loco me volvería si me dices que sí, Si me dices que sí No te dejes llevar por las apariencias Y las prendas mías Eso me lo compré Con mis cheques de regalía Yo trabajo, Y aunque te digan que no doy un tajo Todo lo que tengo es porque me fajo Yo no estoy para relajos Y soy un hombre de una sola hembra El maíz no da frutos si no se siembra Yo que tanto la esperaba ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Headphones downtown, train outside in the rain In my shotgun seat right beside me Country rock and roll, hip hop throwback soul Cross the kitchen floor, just the bare feet Crank the dollar clockwise, winding up her wild side That girl is ready to move  She don't really care who's watching When she gets going there's no stopping her If there's a beat somewhere that's dropping, she's rocking It's a party anywhere that her feet land My baby loves to da-a-ance, da-a-ance, da-a-ance My baby loves to dance  Don't need Friday night ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Someone let your secret out Everybody 'round here's talking about, how your knight in shining armor let you down And now your alone, I told you so This is what you wanted, baby now you got it Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby And now you found  What goes around comes back around It's been that way forever Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together We were so in love, but you gave that up Just look around, are you happy now? Oooh, are you happy now?  Yeah, your going to spend some sleepless nights Crying in the glow of the TV light With some sad song on and a glass of wine ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Your t-shirt hanging on my chair by the mirror Where you like to do your hair I find it everywhere It's on the bed, it's on my floor And I don't mind at all No, I don't  When you gotta go Don't you leave me all alone Leave your perfume on my pillow and your picture on my phone Leave the towel on the shower and that empty shampoo bottle That make-up on the counter You can take, but you ain't gotta Just don't leave me without leaving a trace Cause I love what you've done Yeah, I love what you've done with the place  That smile sure brightens up the room And those eyes go perfect with the view ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I know this tan is gonna fade I'm gonna have to lose these knockoff shades Baby, all because of you that we will never be the same I'll always see you and me just being us again  Time is ticking, I won't waste another minute But my ocean view still has you in it  I'm gonna dance with you like there ain't no tomorrow I'm gonna hold you like the ring of fire about to steal you away In the morning light, the sun will hit the sand And the summer days will wash away So, I'm gonna kiss you while I can Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can  Don't waste a word, let the radio sing ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
If I was a wall, you'd take a can And you'd spray paint, paint all over this man If I was a car, you'd take a key Put the medal to the medal 'til you leave me...  Feeling like I'm vandalized You can't stop getting off, your love breaking, making me Scandalized I get burned, I don't learn, so in turn, I get vandalized  Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey  If I was a window, you'd find a rock Throw a fast ball through me with all you got If I was a priceless work of art, you'd draw a mustache on me That's just how you are ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Every heartland, farmtown, fencepost son Every west coast big break queen All you high rise, skyline, concrete kids Every zip code in between Grab your first time front porch beating heart And gas up your Chevrolet Cause the sun's half gone and it won't be long Til' we make our getaway  This is our time Our night to shine Oh take my hand, hold on tight Don't look back to the morning light Let the world go, play spin slow Tell tomorrow not to hurry, we're just fine This is our night to shine  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
What do you say, girl We do something crazy? Quit putting it off You know what I'm sayin'  Ain't like it ain't gonna happen, forever's a given It's already written, who we kiddin', baby, come on The stars can't line up any straighter Let's do it now and think about it later  Why wait another minute For something we should've done yesterday I know a little church With a preacher who could hook us up right away  Love don't need a reason, baby, I don't see how I could Love you any more than I do today  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
