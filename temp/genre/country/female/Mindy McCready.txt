(mark germino)  If there was anyway out where I could slip away and take my heart with me If there was anyway out where I could slip away and leave my mind at ease 'cause if my head was on right you wouldn't be sitting here tonight watching me shakin' it But if my heart was in tact you know I'd let you have the first crack at breakin' it ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
The first thing I did when you said goodbye Was sit myself down and have a real good cry The next thing I did was put my red Dress on And go downtown dancing 'till the break of dawn  A girls gotta do what a girls gotta do And now I gotta get to gettin' over you Too bad I gotta do it with someone new But a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do  Fancy meeting you at our stomping ground ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Got in this morning at 4 a.m. You're as mad as you can be Well I was drinking and talking and you know how that goes Time just slipped away from me By the time I knew what time it was It was too late to call home Stop carrying on acting like a child I wasn't doing anything wrong  Guys do it all the time And you expect us to understand When the shoe's on the other foot You know that's when it hits the fan Get over it, honey, life's a two way street Or you won't be a man of mine Sure I had some beers with the girls last night ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

(sunny russ)  There's a warm breeze Blowin' on the back porch babe Listen close you'll hear the rain The whisper in your voice is making me weak Your love speaks my name  There are many ways I want to love you But only when the time is right Will the rain wash your love away If I don't stay the night ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(gary white)  Love will abide, take things in stride Sounds like good advice, but there's no one at my side And, time washes clean, love's wounds unseen That's what someone told me, but I don't know what it means  'cause I've done everything I know To try and make him mine And I think I'm gonna love you For a long, long time  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(tim johnson/david malloy/kim williams)  You can fill your local honky-tonk with every guy in town Tell the bartender to set 'em up, free drinks all around Pump the jukebox full of quarters and let that music roar And watch the boys standing there, staring at the door  'cause it ain't a party 'till the girls arrive When that curtain hits the air the dance floor comes alive Let's get it started, make it last all night ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(mark d. sanders/ed hill/david malloy)  I'm afraid were moving a little to fast He thinks were movin' to slow I'm sittin' here praying this movie will last another hour or so.
