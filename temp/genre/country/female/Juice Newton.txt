If you've ever had a broken heart, You promise yourself to never let it happen again. Don't wanna think about it. Don't wanna dream about it, But it finds its way back into your head.

Did you hear the one about heaven? There's a guy that's running the sky. I heard his daddy gave us all seven; when we die we might be surprised. It feels like the whole thing's made up; I can't really see their design. Don't want to burn forever; so much for water to wine. When you look into a microscope things get real.

First you lost your angels, then you lost your crown. Give up your holy crusade - what was lost has just been found. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

First you lost your angels, then you lost your crown. Give up your holy crusade - what was lost has just been found. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I've been mistreated, I've been abused. I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused 'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated. Since my baby left me I've been losing my mind, you know I have.  I've been lonely, I've been cold. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
This thing called love, I just can't handle it This thing called love, I must get round to it I ain't ready Crazy little thing called love  This thing (this thing) Called love (called love) It cries (like a baby) In a cradle all night It swings (woo woo) It jives (woo woo) It shakes all over like a jelly fish I kinda like it Crazy little thing called love  There goes my baby She knows how to rock 'n' roll ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
No I can't forget this feeling Or Your face as You were leaving But I guess that's just The way this story goes, You always smile But in Your Eyes Your sorrow shows Yes it shows.  No I can't forget Tomorrow When I think of all My Sorrows When I had You there But then I let You go And now it's only fair that I should let You know What You should know.  I Can't Live ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Did you hear the one about heaven? There's a guy that's running the sky. I heard his daddy gave us all seven; when we die we might be surprised. It feels like the whole thing's made up; I can't really see their design. Don't want to burn forever; so much for water to wine. When you look into a microscope things get real. When you take a better, second look miracles fade. First you lost your angels, then you lost your crown. Give up your holy mission - what was lost has just been found. First you lost your angels, then you lost your crown. Give up your holy crusade - what was lost has just been found. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
See me dancin' in the corner with all my best girlfriends Laughin' and singin' these are the days of your innocence  All us boys want in your circle but we don't dare break in I'm leanin' against the wall thinkin'  While your laugh is still easy and your heart is still light Why don't you dance with this red-blooded American girl tonight 'Cause your life is just a breath and tonight is just the dance So why don't you give this red-blooded American girl the chance  A men stands beside me in my mind His hair has a touch of gray Sometimes I just shut my mouth I know he knows what I'm gonna say ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Be, Be the charming type, Take off your gloves and show what they hide, Please, please my naked wrists, With your hands and fingertips And please, baby get on your knees, Don't bare bare bare your teeth, I'll let you try, If you close your eyes, I'll have an answer for your ass!

You can say, old things must end You can smile and even pretend And you can turn and walk away so easily But you can't say, you don't love me anymore.  You can dream of what might have been You can cry for what won't pass again And you can say there's every reason you should leave ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
If I don't go now, I never will Lord, I'd be dead if looks could kill Those slings and arrows thrown my way Maybe you just made your passion play  With those dirty looks Love those dirty looks Get back down to the naked truth With those dirty looks  Don't you know that it's not nice to stare? ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

'Til I loved you Didn't know the meaning of the word I was only taking Giving nothing in return Now, my life was an empty page Less than an even trade  'Til I loved you I was fooling everybody but myself Just going through the motions Deep inside, I knew I needed to be touched I didn't know how much ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It's been a long time Since I walked through this old town Oh, how the memories start to flow There's the old movie house They finally closed it down You could find him there every Friday night Twenty years ago  He worked the counter At the drugstore down the street But nobody's left there he would know On Saturday mornings That's where all our friends would meet You'd be surprised what a dime could buy ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Since she's been gone I want no one To talk to me It's not the same But I'm to blame It's plain to see  So go away and leave me alone Don't bother me  I can't believe That she would leave Me on my own It's just not right Where every night I'm all alone  I've got no time for you right now ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Slipping away Back into the wild again I can feel the restlessness There's something here that can't be tamed  I can feel it burning And I don't wanna feed the flame I'd rather see you running free from me Back down on the street again  Driven, I can feel the spirit I can feel the motion Down on the street, yeah Dreaming, I can see you dreaming Baby, baby, don't you worry about me Maybe you were meant to be ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Some people walk, some people run And some never move at all I wanna live like the Rolling Stones And die like a shooting star  Oh, you and I are two of a kind We never will be here One of these nights we'll leave this town And never look back again  Runaway hearts (Our hearts, runaway hearts) They'll never take us alive Baby, we're young We're gonna run Until the day that we die  Runaway hearts (Our hearts, runaway hearts) We're searching for our paradise We'll never stop Till we've gone too far Chasing our runaway hearts  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
