Bring it on to me.  We're backwoods Dixie, flat woods pickin', Shotgun wavin', long-neck drinkin', Huntin' and a-fishin', workin' and a-wishin' for the weekend.  We say: "Yes Ma'am, No Ma'am, Sir, can I lend a hand?" Take a stand for somethin' we believe in. Love an' pray and do anythin' for a good friend.  We like camp fires burnin', buttermilk churnin', Old folks, dirt roads windin' and a-turnin', To a muddy creek; jumpin' from a talltree into the deep end.  That's a country thang. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Before my second year of college, you were barely seventeen. I was haulin' hay for your Daddy, an' you brought me a glass of tea. To a farm boy from Oklahoma, you were small town Texas prize, An' every young man's dream in cut-off jeans, with that Homecoming Queen smile. You were makin' fun of my farmer's tan an' I was lettin' you. An' fightin' bull in the July heat, tryin' to keep my cool.  An' the prairie wind sang while the dust devils danced. It just got hotter as the summer passed. An' that first kiss stole our breath away. An' the breeze died down as our hearts surrendered. The moonlight shattered as it crashed on the river. We both knew we'd never be the same: 'Cause love changes everything.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I'm startin' to notice things in my life. Seein' it all in a different light. An' I've opened my eyes. I'm learnin' to gaze up at the stars: See 'em for more than what they are. And I think I know why. The change in me is plain to see. And I know that I've got you to thank for:  Makin' this world of mine slow down. Puttin' my feet back on the ground. Showin' me what life's all about. I got you to thank for that. 'Bout takin' the time to talk. Slowin' my run down to a walk. And I'm happy where I'm at. I got you to thank for that.

Look at me, eighteen and tanned, Behind the wheel of my old van, "Hotel California" turned up loud, No air-conditioning, windows down. Look at you smilin' at me, Don't know when I've been as happy, As that weekend out in Joshua Tree, When I got down on my knees. An' I like lookin' at old photographs. Reminds me of the way we've always made each other laugh.  Pictures of a life we've made together. Memories of a love that just gets better with time. So many good times, There's no way I will forget. They've got me thinkin' 'bout pictures, We haven't taken yet.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Ah, sit down here with me now.  Baby, you look good tonight, That cotton dress sure suits you right, But I may not be thinkin' what you're thinkin'. Before I go an' promise you, All those things that lovers do, Girl, you need to know that I've been drinkin'. Under normal circumstances, I'd never lie to you, But the devil in me dances when I've had one or two.  You know love and alcohol, Can't trust that stuff at all. It always seems to get the best of me. The combination's dangerous, Every time I mix 'em up, I end up sayin' somethin' I don't mean. Well, it ain't my fault: Blame it on love and alcohol. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
The first night we brought you home, it scared me half to death. I stood right beside your crib and counted every breath. Lookin' at your little face, heaven seemed so close, It felt all right to ask the Lord for what I want the most.  I wanna be there when you're one, And you're just learning how to walk. I wanna be there when you're two, An' hear the funny ways you talk. I wanna be there when you're three, An my wall's covered up with chalk. My only prayer: I wanna be there. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
