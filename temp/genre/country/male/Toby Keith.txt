(Toby Keith/Scotty Emerick)  June fell for Johnny on the Forth of July, As the fireworks popped in the summer sky. With a spark in her eye, she just there an' stared, As his face lit up to the rocket's red glare. An' by September, she'd asked him for a weddiing band. How could she know he was a ramblin' man. He walked out the door in the dead of the night. An' a sleepy voice whispered, as he turned out the light:  "Where you gonna go? "What you gonna do when you get there? "Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea? "Oh, you're never gonna find, "Someone who loves you like I do.

If I was Jesus I'd have some real long hair A robe and some sandals, is exactly what I'd wear I'd be the guy at the party Turning water into wine Me and my disciples We'd have a real good time  Oooh and I'd lay my life down for you Yeah, and I'd show you who's the boss I'd forgive you and adore you While I was hangin' on your cross  If I was Jesus I'd have some friends that were poor ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Ain't got no tricks left up my sleeve Ain't got no reason to believe I've been looking for a sign Love shouldn't be so hard to find  I've been sleeping on your couch Just been layin' here alone I've been doing without Oh, you've been doing me wrong  Nothing left here to decide I think it's time for me to ride Put my bike out on the highway Feel that wind all in my face  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She came through the front door Lookin' fast as a big train bookin' down the line And she was lookin' fine Long and lean and dressed to kill Stacked up high with perfect wheels And there ain't no chance That girl would ever dance with me She got all those city boys out pushin' and shovin' A country boy like me don't ever get no uptown lovin'  She's sweet She's got 'em melting in her hand Whoever gets a taste of that cup of sugar Sure is a lucky man She's sweet I'm tellin you boys, she's babe-a-licious ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Me and JB and Sonny, we grew up on the buddy plan Weren't we some bad mothers, closer than brothers Had a rockin' little three-piece band Yeah we wrote a lot of songs about women Then we tried to sing 'em pretty for the girls Pushin' everythin' we did to the limit Livin' right out on the edge of the world.  I recall on summer night at a party We were sophomores hangin' out by the lake I got off on some wine with a waitress Sonny had a girlfriend that just couldn't wait JB hooked up around midnight With an ugly girl from up in the city He downed every can of beer in the cooler Just tryin' to drink that poor thing pretty. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
