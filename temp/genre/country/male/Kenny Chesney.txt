Met a man wearin' a t-shirt, said "Virginia is for lovers" Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name" We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain  Get along, on down the road We've got a long long way to go Scared to live, scared to die We ain't perfect but we try Get along while we can Always give love the upper hand Paint a wall, learn to dance Call your mom, buy a boat Drink a beer, sing a song Make a friend, can't we all get along ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I couldn't wait to turn sixteen And drive all the boys around Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel Was all I could think about  A little rust in the bed of that truck And a four speed on the floor Five hundred dollars it was mine, all mine And I never wanted nothing more  I took Katie down by the river With a six dollar bottle of wine Just a fool tryin' to play it cool Hopin' she'd let me cross the line  And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell I'd never been that far before The first time's a one time feeling And I never wanted nothin' more Now I never wanted nothin' more ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I turned on the evening news Saw an old man being interviewed Turning a hundred and two today  Asked him what's the secret to life? He looked up from his old pipe Laughed and said, "All I can say is  Don't blink, just like that you're six years old And you take a nap And you wake up and you're twenty-five And your high school sweetheart becomes your wife  Don't blink, you just might miss Your babies growing like mine did Turning into moms and dads Next thing you know your better half  Of fifty years is there in bed And you're praying God takes you instead Trust me friend a hundred years Goes faster than you think, so don't blink  I was glued to my TV, when it looked Like he looked at me and said ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

She played third base on a softball team Had a pretty good arm and real nice swing I was workin' part-time out at Gentry's farm I had thing for a girl in a uniform After the game she was mine, young, wild and free Yeah old Mr. Gentry was pretty cool He said son, "I know where I'd be And what I'd say if it was me"  But, one of these days We're gonna have to grow up Have to get real jobs and be adults, someday, just not today Have to worry about things out of our control Like kids, love, and money and gettin' old, someday Just not today, just not today ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Everybody thinks I've got it all Nobody really does, do they? I've got more than I deserve More than I ever dreamed But there's always a price you pay  It's been an amazing road I've been blessed, I know But at the end of the day, I go home alone  I still hope someday I'll have a wife and kids Smiling faces running to the door And when I walk in saying, "Daddy's home You were gone too long, what'd you bring me? Swing me, let me show you what I did"  I still dream about that look on a woman's face ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Steel drums still ringing in my head Well I feel pain, So I'm not dead From the looks of things, it looks like It got a little crazy last night  Could I get your name again?

I move on like a sinner's prayer Lettin' go like a levee brakes Walk away as if I don't care Learn to shoulder my mistakes I'm built to fade like your favorite song Get reckless when there's no need Laugh as your stories ramble on Break my heart, but it won't bleed  My only friends are pirates It's just who I am Well, I'm better as a memory Than as your man  I'm never sure when the truth won't do I'm pretty good on a lonely night ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She's thinkin' about what her kids are doin' Five miles away, it's almost time for bed They're brushin' teeth and hearin' one more story And in the mirror she paints her lips bright red  She wishes she could call and say she loves them But the boss man says, no calls go out or in So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty If she didn't have to take it off again  She's dancin' for the groceries She's dancin' for the rent She's dancin' for the credit card That she's already spent  In sequence and in laces She's dancin' for the braces So her kids can have a perfect smile someday Smilin' while she dances is the price she has to pay  They tell her in this job there is no future ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
"I walked in there," said Slim Cleaning up his memory with some sapphire gin Mr. Paine grabbed my arm, pulled me aside And said, "Kid, are you ready for the wild ride"  I looked up, there she stood, I said "If you didn't look so great, I'd say you look good" Oh, she took her hand, ran it up my thigh And said, "Cowboy you ready for the wild ride"  Come on now, junior, take a wild ride See can you make it on the wild ride Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride 'Cause things start breakin' on the wild ride  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Sometimes they're in a bottle Sometimes a pair of high-heel shoes Some come rolled in paper Some have six strings and only play the blues  Once you've met the Devil There ain't no way he'll let you be When I'm not chasing demons There's demons chasing me  The skeletons in closets Ghosts underneath the bed They hide out in pictures And words better left unsaid  They hang around like perfume And haunt me like an ancient melody When I'm not chasing demons There's demons chasing me  There's things that I can't leave alone ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town, Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around. Moonshine, that's where they make it, Put it in a jug, makes you wanna get naked. But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night And took it all the way to the end of the line. Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand What a long strange trip  I spent my whole life running around Still let the wind kinda blow me around Well I dropped a note in a bottle To a long-legged model And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world A pirate flag and an island girl  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Well, I see the souls of so many friends And I see us all back here again With sandy floors and celing fans A rastafarian one-man band With songs that fill my memories like a tip jar Yeah, that's what I see When I see this bar  I see tourists at Christmas time And I taste beers with a hint of lime I feel lonely 'cause it's not the same Different faces and different names Living like pirates out among the stars Yeah, that's what I see  When I see this bar  Pieces of our past slowly slip away But time just stands still ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Let the night come to see us, the music come free us And let's start drifting away.  Leave all our problems behind now, no worries. Everybody join hands cause it's time now, now.

Lindy strolls around  Down main streets Down side streets Makin his way through town he picks up pennies Saves 'em for a rainy day With callous feet he makes his way to see the sun sink in the bay  Lindy strolls around and around and around Around and around and around He plays piano at the church when nobody's watchin' Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see Him talkin' to himself, laughin' to himself Lindy strolls around and around and around ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Everybody's got a place they go When the old battery gets running low. I'm a sucker for the sand and sea, yea If I had my way, hey I'd always be  Way up high in a coconut tree Layin' low, just my baby and me Sunny sky as far as I can see High up in a coconut tree  Not to green, not too brown, I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down. Coconuts, a couple of bucks a piece And you can do alright if you ain't afraid to be  High in a coconut tree ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It's that time of day That we all knew would come To pay for all the rum And pull up anchor cause we're done It's that time of day I see a cotton candy sky So many colors in my eyes Proof again God's alive  This ain't a goodbye It's a "till I see you again" What a wonderful time We've all shared my friends Another day at sea Has come and gone away So adios to Jost Adios to Jost Adios to Jost It's that time of day ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Some say we're the land of misfit toys, An insane mix of girls and boys. Nothing really changes, like a stretch of sand time forgot.  That's just livin', that's just livin' That's just livin' life on a rock, yea.  Well you don't lose your lover, you just lose your turn. Drivin' on the left side gotta be learned. Happy hours from 3 to 6 but it never really stops.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I've seen so many places and so many faces, Left behind so many traces of my soul. I carry all these voices with the ringing in my ears, Some girl's tears and the rhythm of the road. Sometimes my life takes more than I can give. That's when I gotta go  Where no one's around But the silence and the sound Of "Three Little Birds" for company. I got a sip of something strong, A secondhand "Old Man and the Sea", Out here with me, Me and Marley, Me and Marley  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
