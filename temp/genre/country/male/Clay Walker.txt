I was standing at the checkout by a rack of magazines Cover story told about another heartbroke beauty queen How she was gettin' over just one more sad affair And as I waited for my change, you know it hit me then and there  That ordinary people have extraordinary love A million little miracles far beneath the stars above The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me Is a life as ordinary as can be  Then I heard some famous people had an anniversary ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She's perfect for a cotton dress Pretty when her hair's a mess A little wine and she gets a little loud  Once or twice she's bleached my jeans She's been known to burn the beans But in my heart there's never been a doubt  She's right as rain on a thirsty cornfield Right on the money 'bout the way that I feel A cool breath of fresh air When life tries to burn me down  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
What's that look you're givin' me Starin' me down with fire in your eyes But it's alright, baby, 'cause you look so good When you're givin' me a hard time  I can tell by your smile That makin' up might take a while  Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight Wrap yourself around this heart of mine Let's count the stars in each other's eyes Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight  Yeah, that's right, I meant what I said ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It's the third hardest thing I'll ever do, Leaving here without you. And the second hardest thing I'll ever to do, Is telling her, about you.

(Clay Walker/M.

My boss told me again just today To get my mind on my job That's so easy for him to say He's never held you in his arms And my mind's wherever you are  If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout love If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman Then what's he thinkin' of  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

She could see him from a mile away Kickin' up dust down the dirt road She ran out and met him at the front gate Hopped in the truck and said let's go You wouldn't think there'd be much to do So far from the city lights But give two kids all that room And there's no tellin' what they'd find  They felt the rhythm of the wind Blowin' through the wheat fields The sun wasn't all that fell As the moon began to rise Beneath the stars in each other's arms They were onto somethin' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She loves to buy those designer clothes And she tends to cry at the picture shows And she'll makes plans without telling me And I dont understand I guess its just a woman thing  But whatever it is that I cant figure out It all comes clear when she walks in and the lights go down It's a mystery that I cant explain ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

He was driving home one evening, in his beat up Pontiac. When an old lady flagged him down; Her Mercedes had a flat. He could see that she was frightened, Standing out there in the snow. 'Till he said "I'm here to help you ma'am, By the way, my name's Joe."  She said, "I'm from St. Louis", And I'm only passing through, I must've seen a hundred cars go by, This is awful nice of you."  When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk, And was about to drive away, She said, "How much do I owe you?"  Here's what he had to say:  : Chorus: ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away Gonna drink every drop of happiness till they cover me up I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love  I got a buddy that wakes up worryin' about stocks and bonds He's up and he's down and he only smiles when the market's strong I spend my whole week's wages at the dance on Saturday night I won't never grow a portfolio but, hey, that's alright  I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Something about the way she's wearing Her dress a little tighter Something about the way she's staring She's looking to start a fire  Something about the way she's dancing And drinking chilled Patron If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long  Heaven help the fool who did her wrong It's too late, too bad, she's too far gone He should have thought of that before he left her all alone If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I gas up my truck and I drive into town But I spend all my time just running around Trying to shake this negative mood I'm in  I've nowhere to go if I wanna get down All the usual suspects are hanging around But after a round or two, it was just a another day again  For a minute or two I'll get you off of my mind But you keep coming back to me every time  Where do I go to get over the fact That you got on a plane and you ain't coming back? ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Remember how time used to drag The summer couldn't get here fast enough You made A's and B's, I was C's and D's Your daddy hated me 'cause you were into me Nobody'd ever be good enough for his little girl  Had a fast car and a hard head Didn't give a damn what he said I was gonna do what I was born to do No cold stare, no cursin', nobody, no nothing ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

This tie's fitting just a little too tight Might have had one too many last night I wonder if it's written all over my face It's been a little while since I've seen this place  Still I'm sitting here in the back row Like a long lost son is come back home When I bow my head and taken off my hat A Sunday morning takes me back  Growing up under that hometown church steeple Learning God hates sin but still loves people The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand  And one hot summer when I was thirteen Took my soul to the river and washed it clean Feels so good, Lord, why can't there be ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

24C don't believe in God But he always prays when a thing takes off And the grandma that is next to Watches the window And 3B's got her headphones on Still not used to her daddy being gone She gets to see him every 3 months For a weekend Just people in planes 17 A's in a exit row Waiting for his Jack and coke to show He's just wishing he wouldn't have Settled so fast in college And I'm over here in the middle seat Watching the world but half asleep Wondering why there's never movies On the ones I'm on And it occurs to me Maybe I've got too much time to think ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
