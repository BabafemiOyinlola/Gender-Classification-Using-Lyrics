Go!  We headed out of Kansas in a flatbed Ford. Just a couple hundred dollars, you an' me an' the Lord. We didn't know where we were goin'. We just knew we had to go. Anywhere was better than "Truvy's Hair and Nails". An' workin' at a single pump Texaco.  And maybe it's crazy and we should've planned better. Saved a little money from the little we'd made. Guess we shoulda waited for a better moment, Never taken that chance and played it safe. Sometimes you've got to dance with danger. An' sometimes you've got to face your fears. What's your life if you ain't gonna live it? Nothing but a few short years. All right. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
