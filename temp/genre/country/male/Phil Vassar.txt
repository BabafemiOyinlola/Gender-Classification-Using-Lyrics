I've tried all I can imagine I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride Bye bye, bye bye my baby, bye bye  Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here like they've done before ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Well, I was 18, makin' minimum wage With a Letterman jacket and a Chevrolet I thought I was cool, yeah I ruled the school  You were Cum Laude with the strawberry lips You had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips Your senior year An' I was your daddy's worst fear  We ran off on graduation night Thought a couple of left hand rings Would make everything all right  With a little bit a-live, little bit a-learn Little bit a-watchin' a few more candles burn And findin' out what life was  Ooh, with a little bit a-fuss, little bit a-fight ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I was lousy at math, a failed historian Carlene was the valedictorian I was quarterback in the back of the class She was the whiz kid in the horned-rim glasses It'd been a long time since I'd been around Since I'd set foot on my old stomping ground I ended up by the old school yard And this redhead pulls up in a blue sports car and says "I'll bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever" It took a second to put it all together, I said  Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean Girl you glitter like Hollywood ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I'm Alright (Phil Vassar)  Well it's been a long time glad to see your face I knew we'd meet again another time another place Can't believe it's been so many years You'd better grab a chair and a couple of beers Lookin' good in your three piece suit You know I always knew you'd take the business route You were always the one to follow the light and you look like you're doing alright  Been singin' for my rent and singin' for my supper I'm above the below and below the upper I'm stuck in the middle where money gets tight But I guess I'm doin' alright  I'm all I'm all I'm alright It's a beautiful day not a cloud in sight so I guess I'm doin' alright ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I just left Bobby's house: The service was today. Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is, As I drove away. You know Amy was his only love, In a moment she was gone, long gone: It could have been me or you. Oh, baby, there's no time to lose.  So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses, An' pour us a glass of wine. An' I'm gonna put on a little music, An' turn down the lights. An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, An' rock you all through the night, An' I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my life.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Little Red Rodeo  Well a note said: "You've had time to think about it. Looks like to me you're feelin' kinda crowded. You're not looking for anything permanent here, so my Rodeo is packed and it's in 'goodbye gear.' "  So I shot down to the Longhorn Diner, her sister works there and she'd know where to find her. She said, "You didn't hear this from me, all I'll say is momma's got that place out in Monterrey."  Oh, how fast can I go, I gotta catch that little, red Rodeo. She drove off with my heart, I gotta let her know. Need the girl in that little, red Rodeo. Texas plates, candy-apple red Rodeo. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Phil Vassar/Craig Wiseman)  I was ten, I was thin, I was playing first base with a secondhand glove and dirt on my face In nowhere, Virginia Who'd ever figure that kid in the yard would go very far It was 419 Lakewood, had no silverspoons Just an old beat up upright that played out of tune Now I'm singin' and living the life that I love And when I count my blessings I thank God I was ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I think, before I speak I turn the other cheek more than I used to I'm surprised I'm alive after All of the crazy things that I do  I've still got that wild streak you love But I'm not the man I was But I think I like me better now Than when I was twenty one  Back then, I ran with A reckless abandon in a Pontiac An' I'd smile with a misguided pride When they'd call me a maniac  And I couldn't get gone fast enough ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
The kids screaming, phone ringing Dog barking at the mailman bringing That stack of bills overdue Good morning baby, how are you?  Got a half hour, quick shower Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour My funny face makes you laugh Twist the top on and I put it back  There goes the washing machine Baby, don't kick it I promise I'll fix it Long about a million other things  Well, it's okay, it's so nice It's just another day in paradise Well, there's no place that I'd rather be  Well, it's two hearts And one dream I wouldn't trade it for anything ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
For A Little While (Phil Vassar/Steve Mandile/Jerry Vandiver)  Hot sun dancin' on the river We're sittin on the bank and watch the world go by Our feet in the water she pressed her lips to mine We were so long on love but short on time She could be a honeymoon sweet and a little wild But she was mine oh, for a little while  And I laugh everytime I start to think about us We sent that summer out in style ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She was there in the stands Come rain or come shine She was the lady that smiled all the time I know times were hard, but she never let on No, it wasn't easy But she was so strong  And she believed in me When I just gave up She took all my worries And she gave me love She rocked me to sleep With a sweet lullaby I thank God for that woman in my life ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
