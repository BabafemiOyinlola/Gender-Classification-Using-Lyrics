When your heart is all alone every second Seems so long When it's just you, you can't see through Those ol' clouds that rain so blue  But when somebody loves you There's nothing you can't do When somebody loves you It's easy to get through When somebody loves you The way I love you  When it's late, the sun hangs low ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Well I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears 'Round that Jersey Turnpike Barney stopped me with his gun ten minutes after midnight Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty ol' truck I don't know about that accent son Just where did you come from I said where I come from It's cornbread and chicken Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin' Where I come from tryin' to make a livin' And workin' hard to get to heaven Where I come from Well i was south of Detroit City I pulled in this country kitchen To try their brand of barbecue The sign said finger-lickin' Well I paid the tab and the lady aked me How'd you like my biscuit I'll be honest with you ma'am It ain't like mama fixed it Cause where I come from It's cornbread and chicken ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day Out in the yard with your wife and children Working on some stage in LA Did you stand there in shock at the site of That black smoke rising against that blue sky Did you shout out in anger In fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry  Did you weep for the children Who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who don't know Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below  Did you burst out in pride For the red white and blue The heroes who died just doing what they do Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself to what really matters  I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It was painted red, the stripe was white It was feet, from the bow to stern light Secondhand, from a dealer in Atlanta I rode up with daddy, when he went there to get her  We put on a shine, put on a motor Built out of love, and made for the water Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten A piece of my childhood, will never be forgoten  It was, just an old plywood boat With a Johnson With electric choke A young boy two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it made me feel And I would turn her sharp And I would make it whine He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"  Just a little lake cross the Alabama line But I was king of the ocean When daddy let me Drive  Just an old half ton short bed Ford My uncle bought new, in ' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow, An' so am I. Work day passes like molasses in wintertime, But it's July. I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute. My boss just pushed me over the limit. I'd like to call him somethin', I think I'll just call it a day.  Pour me somethin' tall an' strong, Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane. It's only half-past twelve but I don't care. It's five o'clock somewhere.  Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon, An' half the night. Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay, Hey, but that's all right. I ain't had a day off now in over a year. Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Remember when I was young and so were you And time stood still and love was all we knew You were the first so was I We made love and then you cried.
