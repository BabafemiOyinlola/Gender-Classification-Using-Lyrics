I have never had an easy life But I'm not complaining It has taught me how to stand and fight For what I believe in I guess that's just how I was raised I find it hard to walk away  I will not back down When you push me to the wall Expecting me to fall I will not give in I am not afraid to fight For what I know is right  I can only take so much And when I've had enough It's not in my blood to just lay down I will hold my ground ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I got a place that I like to slip off to When everything starts closin' in And I got some ways that the world don't agree with Yeah some folks would call it a sin But I work like a dog and I'm good at my job And I live for a one-day weekend So I'm takin' off and I might stay a week Hell I may never come back again  CHORUS 1: I need a breather, a sweet senorita Writin' my name in the sand I need a break from this job and this angry boss man Some coconut lotion, a chair by the ocean ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Darryl Worley/Steve Leslie/Randy Hardison)  There's a little shack tucked back in the timber It wasn't much back then but it was home Sometimes it hurts me to remember Just how long I've been gone  Oh how I miss the smell of mama's kitchen And the way she used to sing those gospel songs ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Mark Nesler)  I don't have a lot, but I'm proud of what I've got I can't complain 'Cause I see people hangin' round, on the city streets downtown Living on pocket change There're times I've been confused, felt that I was born to lose Oh but I survived Unlike the one's who pray and feel more than blessed each day To just be still alive  Is there something we can do Seems the odds against survival are a million to one ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
A mist halos the meadow and a soft wind breathes a whisper through the trees As i lean against a hickory I close my eyes and I can almost see The ghostly forms of blue and gray And I can almost hear the cannons blast Standin' in the prescence of the past  The first few waves came cheerin' Fear and hatred runnin' through their blood When the day was finally over Those left wadin' through a crimson flood To think I could be right here In the spot where some young soldier breathed his last Standin' in the prescence of the past  Brother fightin' brother ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Worked all week, got it all done Let's make a Tennessee River run Hey everybody, I think the time is right Let's get together down where the catfish bite Cooped up all winter waitin' on a day like this It's the way I feel when I'm rockin' on the water Baby that I can't resist BBQ grill, summertime jam Just a mile above the Pickwick dam Party on the water, whole lotta fun Time to make a Tennessee River run I'll get my bass boat, crank up your party barge ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
If it's really over and there's nothing I can say I'll do my best to hide the pain and turn and walk away But do me one last favor, and pretend you're hurting too After all we've been through, it's the least that you can do.  I don't know any reason we should let the whole town know Which one of us came up with this plan for letting go Try to leave me just a little pride to get me through After all I gave you it's the least that you can do  When you run into our old friends ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I miss the look of surrender in your eyes The way your soft brown hair would fall I miss the power of your kiss when we made love Oh, but baby most of all I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again let the light back in I miss my friend I miss the colors that you brought into my life Your golden smile with those blue-green eyes ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Dancing in the living room, cutting up a rug Dancing with the baby looks more like a hug Living in a house made of sawmill wood Rollover Beethoven never sounded so good  Chorus: So come on baby, baby let's go Where we get the money honey I don't know But one more baby's alright by me We'll just add another limb to the family tree  Well raising up babies is our new sport You're one day late and I'm a dollar short Now maybe it was planned and maybe it was a goof ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
