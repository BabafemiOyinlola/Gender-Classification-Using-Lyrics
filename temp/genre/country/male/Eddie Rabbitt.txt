A full moon hangs in an empty sky Theyre just two people in a car going by Theyre young and restless and they dont know Theyll take any road, they dont care where it goes  The scene is set, everything is right He turns to her in the fading light And he says, I dont understand it But theres no way to stop it  When we make love And I feel the power you give me Were talking wordlessly When we make love  Time is on the wing, it just goes flying by And it gets late and she starts to cry And he says, we gotta go but it wont always be this way I feel it coming closer every day ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
