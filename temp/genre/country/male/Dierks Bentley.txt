You completely disappeared, You could be a million miles from here, You’re doin’ fine from what I hear, lately. I guess you found your destiny, If this is really how it’s meant to be, Then movin’ on sounds good to me, baby  But you’re still in my arms, in my head You’re still in my car, in my head You’re still in that t-shirt on my bed You’re every song that’s on, you’re gone but you never left In my head... ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I've never been the kind to bear my heart and soul. Yeah, I've always taken pride in stayin' in control. I told myself I'd never fall too deep. But girl you came along and made a liar out of me. I'm as gone as I can be.  I wanna breathe you in, I wanna be so close, you can wear my skin like a new set of clothes. So you can't even tell where you end and I begin. I wanna breathe you in I wanna breathe you in  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I know a little place we can go, yeah Two rights a left right past the liquor store There's a little trail only me and my know With nothin' but tall pines And, my hand to hold  Here's where I smoked my first smoke Drank beer from a can Kissed the first girl Skipped school with my friends Where I went to turn bad times to good Come on lay with me No better place to be Our little secrets safe in these trees 'Cause I hear baby it's just understood What happens in the woods, stays in the woods ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I've been knowin' you for a little while You never fail to make me smile We've never been together, it's just something we talk about When you gonna come around I'm the kind that likes to take it slow Well that's just the kind i'd like to get to know I just wanna get started, i need you to show me how When you gonna come around I've been waiting with a heart full of love just for you to say it feels right enough ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Ever since I met you girl, you been on my brain I can't think of nothing else but you all night and day It's like I got a first class seat up on Ozzy's train It's driving me insane  5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po I'm goin' crazy, thinkin' ‘bout you baby 5-1-5-0, just this side of loco I'm goin' crazy, think I love you baby  I gotta get your number girl, I gotta call you up ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Twenty seven days I’ve been out on the road, I’m a nervous wreck, I gotta get back home. There’s a young bride waiting for me all alone Lord, how she misses me.  I can see her sittin’ in the kitchen chair In a cotton dress with her long black hair. But a woman ain’t pretty if a man ain’t there, That I can’t afford to be.  It’s a shame, it’s a shame She won’t be the one to blame Oh the hurtinest thing in the whole wide world Is the heart of a lonely girl.  Like a red-tail fox to a blue tick hound, She’s the hottest thing for miles around. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
When I'm all alone Or in a crowd In a quiet place Or where music's loud If I'm on the road Or in the other room That's how you know I'm thinkin' of you  When the flowers bloom When the leaves turn brown When the sun is hot When the snow falls down, down When the clouds are gray And the skys are blue That's how you know ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It's just an old beat up truck, Some say that I should trade up Now that I got some jangle in my pocket. But what they don't understand Is it's the miles that make a man.  I wouldn't trade that thing in for a rocket. What they don't know is my dad and me We drove her out to Tennessee She's still here and now he's gone So I hold on.  It's just an old beat up box, Its rusty strings across the top It probably don't look like much to you. But these dents and scratches in the wood, Yeah, that's what makes it sound so good.  To me it's better than brand new. You see this here flat top guitar, Has had my back in a million bars ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
The moon outside, too bright Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed You know my hands, they know where to go To find your fingertips, trace 'em back to your lips Take you on a trip Flip that switch  Make my world go black Hit me like a heart attack Knock me flat on my back, yeah Just keep doing that, that thing you're doing there Brush me with your hair I swear I don't know how long that I can last Make my world go bla-aa-aa-aa-aa-ack  Make my world go bla-aa-aa-aa-aa-ack Like your dress on the floor Yeah, the one you don't need anymore ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
