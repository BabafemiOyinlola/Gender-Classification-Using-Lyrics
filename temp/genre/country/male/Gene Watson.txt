It's hung there on the front porch Since this old house was built It's where the old men whittle And the women fleece their quilts It's held four generations Through whatever life could bring That ol' swing That ol' porch swing  It held a grieving widow When my daddy's daddy died And now it rocks my children When they close their sleepy eyes It's where I popped the question With a quarter karot ring That ol' swing ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
