I was lost and all alone An empty heart without a home Just at the time when I needed a friend She came along and she took me in  And every time I'm feeling down When the world closes in somehow Just in the moment when I need her the most She comes to me and she holds me close  My baby's got good timing Don't know how but she reads my mind And there's just one way to describe it My baby's got good timing  In the night when the world is quiet And she's lying here by my side ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She weren't much to look at, she weren't much to ride She was missing a window on her passenger side The floorboard was patched up with paper and tar But I really was something in my old yellow car  An American boy with his hands on the wheel Of a dream that was made of American steel Though the seats had the smell of a nickel cigar I really was something in my old yellow car  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I saw you, and right then and there I knew I didn't have a prayer You made the move like a thief in the night, so smooth You had the time just right  Oh, I fell fast and hard Once you make your mind up  You really go for the heart I couldn't help but love you, babe You take the feeling all the way That's the way you are Do you want somebody? You really go for the heart You really go for the heart  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Just because I ask a friend about her Just because I spoke her name somewhere Just because I rang her number by mistake today She thinks I still care.  Just because I haunt the same old places Where the mem'ry of her lingers ev'rywhere ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
A campfire, some coffee From a tin cup in my hand Sure warms the fingers when it's cold aplayin' an old guitar A friend I understand Sure smoothes the wrinkles in my soul  Asleepin' in the moonlight A blanket for my bed Leaves a peaceful feelin' in my mind ... Wakin' up in the mornin' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
When she walks in the room, everybody gets quiet You can hear hearts start beating inside And the way that she moves You just can't deny it They all wish that they could hold her You can see it in their eyes  She's everybody's dream girl Everybody's dream girl Everybody's dream girl I'll see you in my dreams tonight  Well, I woke up this morning Found that determined ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Everybody sings a different kind of song All God's children have somewhere where they belong Oh, I heard it said I know it must be true We were meant to be, I'm made for loving you.  Everybody has something he must be ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I won't be blue anymore I'll go out on the town And I'll take all my friends Every honky tonk around And they'll help me forget you And the way it used to be Then I won't be blue anymore  The only friends I've got now Since you've been gone Two arms that used to hold you And the heart that surely broke And the mind that sometimes wonders 'bout my sanity ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
