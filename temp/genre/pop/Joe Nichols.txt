I've got a number on a napkin A pounding in my head It takes everything I've got To crawl out of bed  I lost a hell of a woman Freedom coked me on the chin But I'm doing alright For the shape I'm in  The sun came up again this morning I got a call from a long lost friend Planed this little road trip down in New Orleans It ain't much but it beats where I've been  Yeah, I'm doing alright ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Eatin' strawberry pie in a mid-town diner Next thing you know you're back in South Carolina Stuffin' your mouth at Grandma's house  Then a lady in a booth gets onto her kids Lays down the law like your mama did And it makes you smile 'cause every once in a while  We all go home to a place and a time In our hearts and our minds That we just can't outgrow  There's a tie that'll bind you And love that'll find you No matter where you go Someday, someway we all go home ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Let me pour you a tall one Come sit down next to me Baby, you look so damn good In those faded jeans  Well, I've been stoned cold sober You've been cold as ice Hey, I got a good idea Let's get drunk and fight  Let's get drunk and fight We'll keep the neighbors up all night Now you can scream at me And I'll make you cry  And when the morning comes We'll make some make up love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She said "I'm going out with my girlfriends. Margaritas at the Holiday Inn". Oh have mercy... my only thought, Was tequila makes her clothes fall off.  I told her put an extra layer on! I know what happens when she drinks Patrón. Her closet's missing half the things she bought Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off.  She'll start by kicking out of her shoes. Lose an earring in her drink. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
