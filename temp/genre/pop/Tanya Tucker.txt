There's a tree out in the back yard, That never has been broken by the wind. And the reason it's still standin' It was strong enough to bend.  For years we have stayed together, As lovers and as friends. What we have will last forever If we're strong enough to bend.  When you say somethin' that you can't take back, A big wind blows and you hear a crack. When you say "Hey, well, I might be wrong," You can sway with the wind till the storm is gone. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I wish I'd known the man a little better That turned my mama on He must have been a heck of a man 'Cause mama was a lady don't you know  Mama was no prude but she was proper Never wore her dress too short She didn't care if you did But she'd have never taken a drink Grandma Kate did the best she could To see mama grew up right So she'd be fittin' one day for courtin' And to wear some gentleman's ring  I wish I'd known the man a little better That turned my mama on He was always laughing And singing the right sweet song I wish I'd known the man a little better The turned my mama on He must have been a heck of a man ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She's fifteen and he's barely driving a car She's got his ring and he's got the keys to her heart It's just a matter of time They'll spread their wings and fly  Like two sparrows in a hurricane Are trying to find their way With a head full of dreams And faith that can move anything  They've heard it's all uphill But all they know is how they feel The world says they'll never make it Love says they will  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You said goodbye on Tuesday I figured I would see you by the weekend I either didn't hear you right Or maybe this ol' heart just didn't listen  So I'm writing you this letter I may never send Wonderin' if you're wonderin' how I've been  It's lonely but I'm hangin' in Hangin' out till I'm with you again ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Yeah he's the one - the one I told you about Yeah, it was serious, but it was long ago He just might walk over here And give me a kiss for old times But don't you worry dear Old times next to you, can never compare  I'll take today over yesterday, any day ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Mamma said, "Tell me what's wrong, child You didn't even have to keep a better live And you haven't said two words to me all evening"  She said, "Girl, you got your long face on Your eyes are red and your smile is gone" So I broke down and then told my mamma the reason  I'm in love and he's in Dallas And I'm as blue as a girl can be Is he down there thinking 'bout my love Or drifting away from me?  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There's a full moon up above tonight But I don't know if it will always shine And I can't say tomorrow it won't rain One thing that I know will never change  As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive And day turns into night and there's stars up in the sky As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive I'll give all my love to you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
In a cozy little restaurant for lovers It seems so out of place for you and me We used to play around, under the covers But now it's just a place to watch TV  So love me like you used to When our love was brand new And, darlin', when we're through You can love me again  And hold me like you want to Instead of like you have to Love me like you used to love me When you used to love me  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There's a tree out in the back yard, That never has been broken by the wind. And the reason it's still standin' It was strong enough to bend.  For years we have stayed together, As lovers and as friends. What we have will last forever If we're strong enough to bend.  When you say somethin' that you can't take back, A big wind blows and you hear a crack. When you say "Hey, well, I might be wrong," You can sway with the wind till the storm is gone. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Right about now you'd be saying sweet nothings, and I'd be hanging on your every word. My lips would be wet with your kisses, and we'd be lost in our own little world. Right about now I'd be feeling your heart beat and your fingers touching my skin. Oh, what I wouldn't give to be back in your arms somehow. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Would you lay with me In a field of stone If my needs were strong Would you lay with me  Should my lips grow dry Would you wet them dear In the midnight hour If my lips were dry  Would you go away to another land Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand Wipe the blood away from my dying hands ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
