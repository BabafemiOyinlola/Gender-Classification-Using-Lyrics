Everywhere you look, you can write a book, On the trouble with a woman an' a man. But you cannot impose, you can't stick your nose, Into somethin' that you don't understand.

You see, it felt so right when he held me tight, How could I be so blind?  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
