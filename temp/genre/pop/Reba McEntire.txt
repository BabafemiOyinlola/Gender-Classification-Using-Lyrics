Have you ever made a quilt? I have. it's one of the most therapeutic and calming things I've ever done. and I had a huge sense of accomplishment when I finished.  Both of my grandmothers made quilts, my mama did, and my aunt jeannie did. I loved to open that big box at christmastime knowing it was a quilt that one of them had made. I was so flattered that after all the time and energy they had spent on that quilt, they had selected me to receive it. even as a young girl, I knew a quilt was a gift I would cherish always.  Back when I was living at home, I remember during the winter months mama would set up her sewing machine in the living room over by the window. at night when we'd all be in there watching tv after supper, mama would be over at her sewing machine, making another quilt from the scraps  From a dress or blouse she had made for one of us earlier.  Then, when she had sewn all the squares sewn together, she'd lay the batting  on the living room floor, lay the quilted piece on top of that, and then start tacking it down. when that was completed, she'd sew the border around it. then it was finished. all that remained was for mama to decide who would be the proud recipient of her precious handiwork which represented so many hours of love. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
