Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted I fell right through the cracks Now I'm trying to get back  Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention. I reckon, it's again my turn To win some or learn some.  But I won't hesitate No more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours.  Well, open up your mind and see like me, Open up your plans and damn you're free. Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love. Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
