"Good Ole Boy Like Me" When I was a kid Uncle Remus would put me to bed, With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head. Then Daddy came in to kiss his little man, With gin on his breath and a bible in his hand, And he talked about honor and things I should know. Then he'd stagger a little as he went out the door.  I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees And Those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me, Hank and Tennessee.
