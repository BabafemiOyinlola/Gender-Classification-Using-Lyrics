Please send some snow Some snow for Johnny He wants to build A big snowman  It was a week just before Christmas Way down in Louisiana A little boy was kneeling by his bed In a manner poised and grand  I listened as he said his prayers His voice came soft and low He said, "God tell Saint Nicholas To send a little snow"  Please send some snow Some snow for Johnny He wants to build A big snowman ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Every day it seems that I turn another page, And it feels like the heartache fades a little more away, I look in the mirror and I like what I see, Hey you didn't take that much, baby, out of me...  Something proud and something strong, Fills the absence of a memory that's dead and gone...  (Chorus) I do believe I'm crossing over, I feel that weight come off my shoulder, I close my eyes, and I drift over To the other side... And lord I swear I'm crossing over, I found the strength to let you go, And the thought of you, is getting colder and further from my mind... And I think I've crossed that line- to the other side... ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
