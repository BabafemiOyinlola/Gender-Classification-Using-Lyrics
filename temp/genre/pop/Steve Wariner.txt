For 60 years he shined shoes in the same spot in the shadow of Yankee Stadium... As he shines he hears the game, and in his mind he hears his name as if he played for them... Takes his turn at bat, there's the pitch, he swings at it, and it's gone... Back through the years he's gone... To take the field with Ruth and Gehrig, bring the pennant home... He sees himself in pinstripes, in a lineup of his own... He's stranded on a basepath, somewhere between old and New York... As a customer asks for the shine, he snaps his cloth, another inning ends... Dodgers come to bat, there's a drive, he makes the catch to point he's tossed again... ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Well, I've heard it said, "The grass is always greener" We want what we can't have or so it seems When I looked at you, the world never looked any sweeter And I go home to her and see you in my dreams  So if you want someone to fill your wakin' hours With a love that is real, baby I'm still not free If you think you could fall for a telephone call and some flowers If you're dreamin' of someone you can dream of me  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Cold city like the eyes in the subway station It's ten stories to my desk in the smoggy sky But after five, I'm headed home to heaven to an easy world There ain't nothin like the love of a small town girl.

It's two a.m. and the phone is ringing Guess you were sound asleep But I got something to say to you Baby, it just won't keep All the times I didn't mean to hurt you Thinkin' only of me Funny now that the tables have turned And I'm the one who's down on my knees.

When you told me that you loved me, I believed every single word you said Then you showed me you didn't mean it, you loved somebody else instead.

All my friends say, I should leave you alone You've got a heart like a stone, And a wonderin' eye And I know that they're right I can make up my mind, Not to see you again, But you move through my dreams like the wind, It's no good to pretend, It won't happen again, Cause it'll happen again.

I like livin' in the land of the free And I like how it feels when you lean on me Ever since you wandered into my back yard I dropped my resistance and lowered my guard  You got the pieces of my heart all in a row Knock one down and the whole thing goes It's the domino theory of love It only takes a shove I fall, you fall We gotta keep our defenses up That's the domino theory of love  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
For so long I was looking, For a reason to make living worthwhile I found that reason, When I first saw you smile There was no question you were the answer, For a partner with no dancer or no song You set my life to music, The day you came along.

I didn't cheat I didn't lie So her leaving took me by surprise Just a note on the table Saying we're through At first I went crazy So it took me some time But I finally read between the lines It's not what I did It's what I didn't do I didn't tell her Each day I loved her I took it for granted ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Straight ahead, right down the highway Out across New Mexico Passing trucks with Haggard singing on the radio. There's a shootin' star falling behind me But wishin' won't make a dream come true Right now there's only one thing that I gotta do.

When she told me it was over My tears fell like rain to the ground With the weight of the world on my shoulders I may have gone under but I did not drown.

(Dave Loggins) Seventeen or thirty-five It felt the same then as now I ain't talkin' 'bout husbands and wives And nothin' 'bout wedding vows. Young boy was full of joy Lost his high school sweetheart First time in his life he found himself Out there on that street.
