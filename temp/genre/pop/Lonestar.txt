I still remember the night we met You said you loved my smile But your love for me was like a summer breeze Oh, it lasted for a while I could hold on a little tighter I know But when you love someone you gotta let 'em go so.  I'm gonna smile, 'cause I want to make you happy Laugh, so you can't see me cry I'm gonna let you go in style ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
The sign in the window said for sale or trade on the last remaining dinosaur detroit made seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal for a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels and that road rolls out like a welcome mat i don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at we always said someday, somehow we were gonna get away, gonna blow this town what about now, how 'bout tonight baby for once let's don't think twice let's take that spin that never ends that we've been talking about what about now, why should we wait ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
So you say your love's about to end You say you can't take no more She's out the door Your looking for a friend  Who am I to tell you why But I'm just curious, were you furious Did you swallow your pride Look her in the eye and  Tell her that you love her Tell her that you need her Tell her that you want her to stay Reassure her with a kiss 'Cause she may never know unless you Show her what your feeling Tell her you're believing Even though it's hard to say 'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
He called her on the road From a lonely cold hotel room Just to hear her say I love you one more time But when he heard the sound Of the kids laughing in the background He had to wipe away a tear from his eye A little voice came on the phone Said "Daddy when you coming home" He said the first thing that came to his mind  I'm already there Take a look around I'm the sunshine in your hair I'm the shadow on the ground I'm the whisper in the wind I'm your imaginary friend And I know I'm in your prayers ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She's unusually unusual!  She introduced herself as Amy, said call me Caroline for short She said, I just moved in three doors down so I wouldn't be the girl next door And I knew the shoes she wasn't wearing fit her just right And she said "Hey, man did you know that somebody left your grass out in the yard all last night?"  Chorus She's unusually unusual Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is She's so different and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah She's unusually unusual And that's beautiful to me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Oh yeah Yeah oh yeah  The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes Now I look at my front porch and this panoramic view I can sit and watch the fields fill up With rays of glowing sun Or watch the moon lay on the fences Like that's where it was hung  My blessings are in front of me It's not about the land I'll never beat the view From my front porch looking in There's a carrot top who can barely walk  With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them And the view I love the most ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Tell me what I have to do tonight 'Cause I'd do anything to make it right Let's be us again  I'm sorry for the way I lost my head I don't know why I said the things I said Let's be us again  Here I stand With everything to lose And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end Baby please, I'm reaching out for you Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in Let's be us again  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Oh yeah! Lost my job, came home mad, got a hug and a kiss and "That's too bad." She said, "I can go to work untill you find another job." Ha, I thought, I like the sound of that, Watch tv and take long naps. Go from a hard-working dad to being Mr. Mom, Well, Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer, Crayons go up one drawer higher, Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time, Breakfast 6, naps at 9, There bubblegum in the baby's hair, Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair, Been crazy all day long, and it's only Monday- Mr. Mom! ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
