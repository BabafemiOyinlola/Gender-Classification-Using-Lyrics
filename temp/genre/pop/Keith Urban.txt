Outside my window, I swear on my mamas grave, Faded out the street noise like a, out of focus polaroid, So I shot the moon, and I cursed the wind, Making me think that you were, here again, Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away, Thats the biggest conspiracy since, JFK, So we combed the corners, and glass houses, Right directions, but, never found it.  Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days, Just the mere reflection of your face, For one shining moment...
