Shut up and drive You don't know what you're talking about He's not the one You ought to know that by now You've got one of those hearts That keeps changing your mind Your heart has a way of making you stay So shut up and drive  Don't look in the mirror He might have that look in his eyes The one that's so strong It strangles your will to survive He's mastered the art Of looking sincere His eyes have a way of making you stay ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
