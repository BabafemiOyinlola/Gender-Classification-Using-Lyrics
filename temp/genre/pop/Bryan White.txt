Rebecca Lynn grew up in Carolina, Half a mile from Tucker Cherry's farm.  A quiet girl with green eyes full of fire, Her daddy's pride and all her mama's charm.  Rebecca Lynn became my heart's desire, Long about the start of second grade.  Mrs. Rosenbloom let me sit beside her, So we pass notes and after school we play... Singin'  Ring around the rosie, pocket full of dreams and posies, Patty cake, A Baker's Man, Tag you're it, Kick the Can.  And I think I hear my mama calling, gotta go, Man I loved her so. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
