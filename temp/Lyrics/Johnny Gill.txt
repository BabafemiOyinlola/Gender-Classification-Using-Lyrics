Bottoms up, it's too hot in here
Where's the fire truck when you need o-one
I want a firm foundation, a knockout derriere
I can't believe that my eyes are gaspin' for air

Unlike before, so much to explore
All I need and more, I'm gonna hit the floor
No kids in the candy store, get a lollipop at the door
I won't be no more, I'm gonna hit the floor

Cute Sweet Love Addiction
Gimme a low key brewski
I'm gonna be alright
Just like sugar (sugar)
Girl you're so sweet (sugar girl you're so sweet)
Lip smacking finger licking good
I wanna taste you
Like a fine wine
Smooth and intoxicating
Sip it slow never fast
Try to make it last as long as I can
I gotta have it
Fall in love
What do they call it when you can't get enough
A functional condition (and they call it...)

Seen the world
It's crumbling all around me
A place to go
Where I felt safe
In search of help
I fell down on my knees
I pray to lord
Please keep my way
Doors open I've never know
When I ask faith
He'll show me which way to go
Chorus:
When the road gets rough
I've got to stand
Or else I'll fall
In God's creation
I know where I stand
Temptation sings
Its songs are loud and clear
But I won't let my feet stray from this path

Put on your red dress
And slip on your high heels
And some of that sweet perfume
It sure smells good on you
Slide on your lipstick
Let all your hair down
Cause Baby when you get through

Tonight will be a special night
No matter where we go
And I'm so proud to be with you
I just wanna let you know

You need a love that will not change
You want a lover to remain forever yours
Oh, but you don’t have to worry, you never have to fear
Through thick and thin I’ll always be here

I’ll be your bridge over and through troubled waters
You never have to face it alone
And when the world seems to treat you unfair
Baby, for you I’ll always be there

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

Sometimes I know it’s rough for you
And then there are times you’re hurt and blue, got so much pain
Oh, but I, I’m the kind of person who can take the hurt away
You never have to suffer again

I’ll be your strength to carry you over the mountain
To lift you up when you’re fallin’ down
Baby, be strong, you can believe in me
‘Cause I’m your friend and I’ll always, always, always be right there

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
(Even through stormy weather)

I fell out of bed
This morning
Oh, something was buggin' me
I couldn't sleep ‘cause I hadn't had any lovin'

So I've got to solve this problem out, baby
And darling, I know what the remedy should be

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

As the day goes by
Thought weighs heavy on my mind
Only thing I think about
Is tonight the lights go out

Ooh, and I hope it's you tonight
But not just tonight
Every day and every night I want your love

Take your time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
The man on the street and the couple upstairs

Lately Ive been so lonely
Holding everything
Without love
Now Im holding you
And it feels so good
Dont let go now
Come home with me
(Lets spend the night)
Together
(Lets spend the night)
It feels so good
To know your love will be there
For me
And only me
Scratch my friends opinions
Im not blind I see

Perfect combination
We fit to a tee

We know what takes to last forever, together

So deep inside we share a feeling that's so rare
So sweet just knowing that we are a special pair
We're right on time, we're two of a kind
And heaven knows this love will grow
Stronger every day

Yeah baby, I'm losing my mind, I need you in my life

So tell me how's it feel to know you've done some wrong
To someone who was right for you
Oh, how could it be that you just don't love me no more, yeah

You need a love that will not change
You want a lover to remain forever yours
Oh, but you don’t have to worry, you never have to fear
Through thick and thin I’ll always be here

I’ll be your bridge over and through troubled waters
You never have to face it alone
And when the world seems to treat you unfair
Baby, for you I’ll always be there

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

Sometimes I know it’s rough for you
And then there are times you’re hurt and blue, got so much pain
Oh, but I, I’m the kind of person who can take the hurt away
You never have to suffer again

I’ll be your strength to carry you over the mountain
To lift you up when you’re fallin’ down
Baby, be strong, you can believe in me
‘Cause I’m your friend and I’ll always, always, always be right there

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather

Maybe we're through
Falling in love
Maybe we're lost
But I, I can't go on

What am I to do without you?
'Cause, baby, I'm a fool without you
But a fool in love with you

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe unfair
Maybe I'm gone
Maybe I'm there
Where do I go?
How did I get so confused?

When the morning comes
I'll still be with you
But when tomorrow is through
Are we? Maybe

Maybe I'm fine
Maybe I'm not
Maybe I'm sad
Or maybe I'm lost

People making lists, buying special gifts,
Take your time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
The man on the street and the couple upstairs

Two hearts together, we're a harmony so right
Two sparks united, we're a fire burning bright
For that you're always brand new
Right from the jump we had a hunch
That we had everything

Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better

Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever, together

So deep inside we share a feeling that's so rare
So sweet just knowing that we are a special pair
We're right on time, we're two of a kind
And heaven knows this love will grow
Stronger every day

So I've got to solve this problem out, baby

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

Grab the parachute, let's jump before we die

Behind closed doors

You look sweet as ever
Just how I picture you
Swear that you're looking better
And thats so hard to do
Girl I hope you don't mind
If I remininsce all the time
When I was your guy and you were my girl
There was nobody else in my world

Let's get the mood right
Turn on your heart light
Put on that old red dress
Baby let's cruise
Baby it's your night
Blow out the candlelight
We're going out tonight
Just me and you

Come in, close the door, I got something for you
'Cause you're doin' fine, baby
Said you're doin' fine, baby yeah
Alright yes

There's nothin' wrong with foreplay
My body's yours, have it in your way
Take your time, don't rush it, girl
Ooh yeah, do me right and rock my world

Please, touch me here, touch me there
('Cause you're doin' fine, baby)
Kiss me here, kiss me there
(It feel real good, lady)

Maybe your fault
Maybe unfair
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I care

Maybe we're through
Falling in love
Maybe we're lost
But I, I can't go on

What am I to do without you?
'Cause, baby, I'm a fool without you
But a fool in love with you

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe unfair
Maybe I'm gone
Maybe I'm there
Where do I go?
How did I get so confused?

When the morning comes
I'll still be with you
But when tomorrow is through
Are we? Maybe

Maybe I'm fine
Maybe I'm not
Maybe I'm sad
Or maybe I'm lost

You were the only one, that I ever loved
And you promised you wouldn't break my heart
Oh please, tell me how could you do this to me?
Well, I've been having dreams of losing you
Then some how I don't know my dream came true
And I don't know if I could live alone

Oh, I can't believe you still love me baby
It's even impossible that you would even care
But I know I can't forget that you let me down
And I can't believe you broke my heart

I'm having illusions, I'm losing my mind
I can't sleep at night 'cause I can't have my baby tonight
Yeah baby, I'm losing my mind, I need you in my life

So tell me how's it feel to know you've done some wrong
To someone who was right for you
Oh, how could it be that you just don't love me no more, yeah

I can remember all the things that you once said
My love was so satisfyin'
But now your love is slowly, slowly dyin'
I know what I've put you through
And I wanna make it up to you

Please forgive me, baby
Don't let it end this way
I swear I'll never lie
Just give it one more try

Take me, I'm yours
(Forever)
Take me, I'm yours
 (Forever)
I was a fool to ever let you go
 (Silly of me to ever let you go)

Please forgive me, baby
Don't let it end this way
Girl, give me one more chance
Please take me back again

I tried to deny all the love I have inside
By runnin' away from the truth
Knowin' my love belongs to you, to you
Now here I stand alone with my heart without a home

Please forgive me, baby
 (Please, baby)
Don't leave and walk away
 (Don't leave)
Girl, give me one more chance
 (Give me one more chance)
To win your love again
 (To win your love again)

Take me, I'm yours
 (Take me, take me, open up your heart)
Take me, I'm yours
 (You see I'll do whatever it takes to make it up to you)
I was a fool to ever let you go
 (Silly of me to think that I could live without you, baby)

Girl, it's your body
(You're body, body, baby)
Girl, it's your body
(You're body, body, girl)
I just can't seem to get enough, oh
Enough of your loving

Girl, it's your body
(You're body, body, baby)
Oh, it's your body
Girl it's your body
(You're body, body, girl)
Girl, oh I

Listen
(Tell everybody Johnny)
Don't think that I'm crazy
(I don't)
See you've been my lady
For so many years
And I think it's time that I let you know how I feel
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell, 'em)
You see I finally figured it out
(Figured it out)
Why I still can't seem to get enough of your love
Enough of your love, yeah, yeah
Every time I'm near you
My whole body can't keep still
Girl I'm on fire
Temperature's rising higher and higher
Girl, I loose all self control
Every time, every time you're near
Every time you're near

Oh I know that
It's your body
(Girl, it's you're body)
That keeps me yearning
(Girl it's you're body)
That keeps my body burning

Let me love you, let me love u right
I can do it baby
Love u right, love u right
Let me love you, let me love u right
I can do it baby
Love u right, love u right

Lady, why is it that you're sittin' at home alone
Claimin' that you've got a man, baby, I don't understand
Why would he just leave you, thinkin' you would go nowhere?
Showin' he don't really care about you

You need a man
Oh, one that's gonna show you how to [Incomprehensible]
You need a man
Oh, from real life fantasy

You need a man
Oh, one unselfish lover
You need a man
That knows everythin' that you're thinkin' of
Let me

Girl it seems that we can't get it right, you've been stressin'
Let me be your teacher and give you a lesson tonight
I'ma use my hands, show your body, give you a message
I'ma give you all I got baby, I'm not stopping
'Til I hit that spot don't be afraid to lock in
We went to dinner and a movie and now we're so ready
Girl I've been lookin' at you from the side
Yeah that's my baby, I'm holding a secret
'Cause I want you to find it
Come give me all your love, 'til I can't get enough
Ain't nothing better than feeling your skin girl, it's heaven
Tonight's the night I'm going all in
And I want you bad right now
I wanna lay you on the floor
Or we can do it on the couch
But I'm gonna give you more
Girl let's take it to the bed
Nothing else needs to be said
Just bring me your love I'll give it back girl
I'm in the mood I wanna be next to you
Girl let's take it to the bed
