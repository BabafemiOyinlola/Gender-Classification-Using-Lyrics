In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
Cause I love, love you so
Promise I'll never let you go
In the still of the night

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Five a.m. is the hour
And we just took a shower
Once again I'm headin' home
But I'm satisfied, mmm, to the bone

Like so many times before
You had me beggin' for more
Now I'm runnin' home to her
When it's you I prefer

She's got papers on me
She's got papers on me

And I'm gettin' tired of sneakin' in
Lyin' 'bout where I've been
How long can this go on
Pretendin' to love someone who just don't turn me on

And every time I taste your sweet, sweet lips
I make up my mind to abandon the ship
And man, oh, man, she's crampin' my style
I look in her face and see your sweet smile, but

She's got papers on me
She's got papers on me, oh

Oh, sometimes I wonder what she is getting out of it
You've taken every little bit
You're gettin' all my love and then some
Leavin' her just the crumbs

I'm making this song for all the people who at times in their lives feel bad
You know when you feel like even your blues have blues

If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another

It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a dog eat dog world
Life is full strife, people just aren't nice
Everybody's talking smack, Running games on this and that
Racial resentment adds to this contentment
Talk to any guy he'll tell you taxes are too high
Books movies are corrupt, suicide is way up
Kids are a sorry lot, some folks say it's 'cause of pot
Phony ego trips, everyone has flipped

If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another

Everybody's shacking up, married folks are packing up
Country's going up in smoke, Where is Noah with his boat
Blacks marching on dc, 400 years still not free
Martin paid all a man can pay, still he's not a holiday
Folks messing with my mind, make me Frankenstein
This woman by my side, she's Dr. Jeckyl Mr. Hyde
Can't get my head on right, problems day and night
Try to calm my nerves I've tried smoke, Doctors give me dope to cope

If it ain't one thing it's another
