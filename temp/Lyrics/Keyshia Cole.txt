Thinkin about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me

But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he

A time when we were so secure but
Now it? s like December
When you say that I? m so insecure and

I gotta get away 'cause you're making me weak
It? s keeping me trapped
 (Keeping me trapped)
I gotta be a fool
Sittin' here tryna get that old thing back, oh
 (Thing back, oh)

You use to keep your word
Was one who always did what you said
You use to speak to me so sweet
With something caring to say

Oh, you don? t even try no more
Oh, you don? t even care no more

I don? t wanna love you, don? t wanna need you
Just wanna leave you

There's this girl I know

So deep in love
Do almost any thing

To make him see she's the one

But he doesn't feel a girl like her
He's so so wrapped up

'Coz the average girl will give him
Anything that he wants

He's so caught up
He won't call her

He shows no love

'Til she decides
I changed my mind

I don't love you

Hears the photo I gotcha comin up out her front door
Thought you had me fast but damn you didn't know.
Every time you paged her she would page me and tell me you were there.
And that's a no-no I let you go for months thinkin so wonderin' why you haven't hit this
In so long I'm a smart bitch and I gave you the rope and now your hangin' there.

Sounds like a love song, sounds like a love song
Alright we heard your side of the story, hear mine
I'mma tell you why, 'cause you changed
When you got dough, nah nah nah nah nah, no you listen

I remember like yesterday
The very day I met you
You were lookin' fly, I was actin' shy
So when you walked on by I ignored you

But then you turned around and asked my name
And in an instant my attitude changed
Swept me off my feet, you were so sweet
Full of comedy, you amused me

Gave you my number, next day you called
Askin' if you could see me
So I said alright, you can stop on by
It gave me butterflies

30 minutes, knock, knock it's you
I'm glad to see you, but I keep my cool
From day one I fell in love with you
But now I ask myself who are you because

You've changed, you've changed
You got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
Baby you changed

It wasn't the same
You got dough and changed

Hey, she can't love you like I love you

It started real simple
Comin' through 'cause I missed you
An' I couldn't wait to kiss you
I tried to play shy a little

But not tryin' to move fast
But not too slow
Because I know you're the kinda guy
I see you already got me

She could never be
Half as good as me
You know what I mean
'Cause I'm the real thing
An' I got to have you

In here by your side
Wait before you day and night
Can't understand why
You're not my man

But I should be your girl
I'm fallin' in love again
Goddamn, we kissed again
It went a little bit further then

I thought this boy was just a friend
I need my baby here
'Cause can't nobody love me like he can

Hey, what's happenin'?
Looks like I'm runnin' a little late

And I don't see no end or future or what it seems.

And knowing my frame down when you catch a track
So, could you please holla at me when they catch a stack
And I heard that the new girl that you have is whack.

I'm just tryna be truthful to you.
And let you know.
Everytime I try to leave something always tells me no.

And just when I think it's working
itself out... can't be so.

You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna

'Cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like that
(Eh he he he he)
Yo man he be callin me back
Cause see I'm fine and a matter of fact
(Eh he he he he)
He asked how I do dat dat
Fit my jeans over baby fat
Listen

But I should warn you I don't want ya man
[Keyshia Cole]
I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if wanna go he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he
Where he wanna be
[Chorus:]
If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should

I need somebody who protect my feelings and my heart
Someone who never let no one come in between what we got
There'll never be another woman to do what I do (for you)
And it's like that cause you know that 
It would hurt me bad if I found out you were untrue

(It wouldn't worth it for you)
To see me hurt or to see me down
(You would do what you had to do)
To see me smile again

I believed every word that you told me
There'll be no talk cause you would show me
It'll be a feeling I couldn't describe
You know why?

Cause I would be you best friend
Be there late at night when you walking in be there in morning when
(Be there when you) open your eyes
I'll be by your side
I would be your best friend
Be there late at night when you
Walking in be there in the morning when
Open your eyes

Sometimes I think you do it just so you can walk out
And you're sayin' plenty things that you really don't mean
Or do you really mean it? 'Cause it hurts...
Then I say some foul shit just so I can hit back
But I don't mean it
We done went too far
Damn I thinks it's over

Next time
I won't throw my heart away, again
I just won't, no I won't
Next time
I won't throw my heart away, again

Seem kinda crazy sayin' you love me so much
How could you bring that woman into our home

Before you pull up a seat let me make it clear
I can buy my own liquor, got it paid for, I'm a go-getter
I'm not a gold digger

I know it's kinda hard, not stepping to the finest thing in the club
See you getting your boss on, bottles of Patron, few bottles of bub
Not saying I ain't feeling you but there's some things that just won't do
So come on over if it's cool

You just know it's gonna take more than one drink to get me home
I know you didn't ask but I thought you should know
And it ain't that easy, not that easy to go

You pushed me far... you brought me to this

Elegantly handling gently, never getting my love mistaken
Knowing what you want from me exactly
I know what I want from you, baby please

Please don't stop loving me the way you do
All I want is your smile around
Boy you bring so much joy, baby yeah

No one has been more into it the way he feels
And that's what turns me on, loving the way you do
With the fact that you have more than one string attached

[Verse: Tupac]
What's up boo
Ha ha ha ha
Yeah
Another shady mission
Tricks
Like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making
Take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy
Yesterday was stolen kisses
Blind insanity perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, that they planned for me
If I have kids will I live to see em grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
More broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I'll die alone, but yet and still I'm hoping
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause being here ain't living
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain the world's crazy
Still look for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious
If you play your cards right

I want to be the one who, who you can depend on who
Who'll be the one who'll be there (through the thick and thin)

That I was saving myself for true love, from above (Yeah)
And before I let you hurt me like the rest, boy

Don't show me how you kiss, or where the angels live

To the lies you had given wasn't really in it
The way that you should have been,
And I guess you know I so moved on, once again took a chance to try,
But my heart's still beating... for love.

(See my heart) my heart just wouldn't let me walk away,
(And I knew) I knew if you didn't leave I would have stayed,
(Every day) I couldn't keep pretending everything was ok, (no more hurt)
I don't wish no hurt the way that you hurt me,
There ain't no easy way to let it slip away,
but it was a bitter sweet goodbye.
Cause honestly baby everything was wrong
But you were too caught up to ever notice on your own.

So that I could leave, I did things to make you change your mind... about me,

Maybe one day making it out

Over and over
Krucial Keys, Keyshia Cole
It? s the way it is

Baby, I remember
A time when we were so secure but
Now it? s like December
When you say that I? m so insecure and

I gotta get away 'cause you're making me weak
It? s keeping me trapped
(Keeping me trapped)
I gotta be a fool
Sittin' here tryna get that old thing back, oh
(Thing back, oh)

You use to keep your word
Was one who always did what you said
You use to speak to me so sweet
With something caring to say

Oh, you don? t even try no more
Oh, you don? t even care no more

I don? t wanna love you, don? t wanna need you
Just wanna leave you
(I swear)
I just want it to be over
(I just want it to be over)
I just want it to be over

I don't love you
I don't love you

I don't love you no more
Kanye West on the track, by the way

There's this girl I know

So deep in love
Do almost any thing

To make him see she's the one

But he doesn't feel a girl like her
He's so so wrapped up

'Coz the average girl will give him
Anything that he wants

He's so caught up
He won't call her

He shows no love

'Til she decides
I changed my mind

I don't love you

I used think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playin' games, what's this all about?

And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl what a difference
What you seen in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe

Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found

Last night.
I couldn't even get an answer.
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial.
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression.
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child.

I know you can hear me.
I know you can feel me.
I can't live without you.
God, please make me betta.
I wish I wasn't the way I am.

(Keyshia Cole:)
If I told you once, I told you twice.
You can see it in my eyes.
I'm all cried out with nothing to say.
You're everything I wanted to be.
If you could only see your hearts belongs to me.
I love you so much.
I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free.
Forever yours I'll be.
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away.

I couldn't even get an answer. (You said you couldn't get an answer baby)

And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child. (The way I feel, a baby)

Been sittin', thinkin' 'bout you
And I am wonderin' why we're not gettin' along
So frustrated 'cause what we had was a happy home

I don't know what the situation is
But I can tell in the way we kiss
We don't talk no more, it feels better when I'm alone

Sometimes I feel like there's no gettin' through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do
You gotta show me that you want me to stay
Don't turn and walk away

Baby, I'm slowly fallin' out of love with you
I don't know what to do
How did we end up here this way?
What are we gonna do?

I'm slowly falling out
Baby, we're trippin' on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me half way
If you want me to be with you

Look into my eyes... and tell me what you see.

Now all your lies has caught up wit your game.

And where were you when I cried at Night
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you, I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out, I remember when I screamed I hated you
But some how deep inside I deep inside still lovin' you

If that's the case I should go have my fun
And do all the things you say I do
Boy, I can't continue to take this from you

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have given away my love
As much as you accused me, I should have cheated

When you say I was out with somebody else
When my girl told me she saw you with some girl
But I didn't accuse you of something that I didn't see myself

A few times in the past
Never last as strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh, no more will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven (ooh, 'cause)

Alright we heard your side of the story, hear mine
I'mma tell you why, 'cause you changed
When you got dough, nah nah nah nah nah, no you listen

I remember like yesterday
The very day I met you
You were lookin' fly, I was actin' shy
So when you walked on by I ignored you

But then you turned around and asked my name
And in an instant my attitude changed
Swept me off my feet, you were so sweet
Full of comedy, you amused me

Gave you my number, next day you called
Askin' if you could see me
So I said alright, you can stop on by
It gave me butterflies

30 minutes, knock, knock it's you
I'm glad to see you, but I keep my cool
From day one I fell in love with you
But now I ask myself who are you because

You've changed, you've changed
You got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
Baby you changed

It wasn't the same

It started real simple
Comin' through 'cause I missed you
An' I couldn't wait to kiss you
I tried to play shy a little

But not tryin' to move fast
But not too slow
Because I know you're the kinda guy
I see you already got me

She could never be
Half as good as me
You know what I mean
'Cause I'm the real thing
An' I got to have you

In here by your side
Wait before you day and night
Can't understand why
You're not my man

But I should be your girl
I'm fallin' in love again
Goddamn, we kissed again
It went a little bit further then

I thought this boy was just a friend
I need my baby here
'Cause can't nobody love me like he can

Hey, what's happenin'?
Looks like I'm runnin' a little late
I got caught up in the middle of somethin'
But I'm still tryin' to come see you later on though

To understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard time and time again but I
Didn't know my love wouldn't grow, I shoulda just let it go
But I, stayed around thinkin you would learn to love

And we both know, you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I shoulda let you go
Shoulda let you go (x3)

Couldn't do without it, I felt I needed you in my world (to get me by, by)
More and more I looked out for you, you tried to play me like a fool so I didn't care, that love wasn't there, had to just let it go

Lately, I been thinkin' bout you goin crazy
Cant go on without you in mys life its true
Wat you wanna do
U can be my boyfriend
I can be your girlfriend

Here there Q-Tip? Ha whats the deal?
Had to let you know how I feel
Had a bunch of girls, but ima keep it real
Them otha chickenheads couldnt foot the bill,
But you, its somethin bout you baby,
What it is? I dont know
Maybe 'cause ya body just right,
Wit a sexy smile,
And you know how to get that dough
Plus the heart for red just like Bo(Q),
Feel me up, when im feelin low,
When im home or out the road, no questions asked,
You know its on as soon as I hit the door, (Fo sho)
And I need that on my team,
Baby you was made ofr me,
Had somethin on my mind
And forgot wat it was, and thats because

Lately, I been thinkin' bout you goin crazy
Cant go on without you in mys life its true
Wat you wanna do
U can be my boyfriend

It's time to grow up
I embarrass myself enough
Cause I wouldn't leave you ooh
Even my family know the truth yeah yeah

You've taken me under
Round in circles like you know you do
I've called on my brothers
They said don't call me till you know you're really through

But every time it feels like
This could be the last time
Where's the good in goodbye
If I give this one more try
Its hard cause they say that if its true love it never dies

Oh what a oh what a feeling
The one that I thought that I needed
Was Incapable incapable of needing me back
Incapable incapable of loving like that

Enough of no love, enough of no love

And I, don’t mind,

And I, don’t mind, 
you staying out all night long hanging with the guys
But I do mind, 
when you look me right dead in the eye and you tell me lies

You see it pays to tell the truth and look at what you had to loose
Should think before you do, did you not know the rules?
You see it pays to tell the truth, feel so sorry for you
You could have had it all, too bad you gotta fall
Now you live, now you live with zero
Nothing, now you live with zero, nothing nada
Now you live with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
Nothing, now you live with zero, nothing nada
Now you live with zero

London on the track
Can't kick it how we kick it
We tell a trick to kick the rocks
I see the bullshit and I dismiss it
I done been through a lot
I done been around the block
(?) try not to...

Don't waste my time, I don't have it for you
You blowin' mine, playin' with my mind
So don't waste my time, cause I don't have it for you
You blowin' mine, playin' with my mind
Ohhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

Oohhh, I can't think right
Hurry up and move or you can't think bae
If you snooze you lose but I might fuck your wife
You can call me Tom Cruise, I wanna wreck your life
Wreck it, red coupe, spaghetti and I check it

Turn, turn, turn, turn my music up
Not tryna overdose on your love
Don't wanna be heartbroken, no more
You're tryna kill me, with all this nonsense
But I ain't havin' it, no more
You're the love that reflects in my eye
But you take it, away from me
And constantly

We, fuck, we fight, we make up
It seems to be us right now
It's love right now
We fuss, we fuck, we make up
But is this really us right now?

911, what's your emergency?

You took her round the corner by the condo
I know what your tell
Even took her round the corner by her favourite bar
Pulled up an did it in the back seat
She said you know her family well
Her sister and her brother, even her mother too
Even been giving her money for a few years
I feel so faint now
Don't know what I'm doing
On my way to you in the heat of passion

Somebody better call the police
Cause I'm feeling kinda crazy right now
It hurts, and I can't do much about it
Cause I ain't catching no cases
And baby I ain't doing no time, for you
In the heat of passion

Together, baby.
Heavenly Father,
Which You are in Heaven
I pray that You keep this love together.

I prayed about this for days
And something told me
That you ain't changin', no.
And I cried from the love that we made
That's why it hurts me
Cause we ain't growin'
After all the things you put me through.

You done apologize so many times, it's like a broken record
And I'm startin' to think that I hate you
We were almost to the best part, best part

See, it's niggas like you that
Make it hard to love, make it hard to trust,
So hard.
A nigga like you make me wanna curse, burn up all your stuff
You've got your charm
A nigga like you,
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you.

The fightin' and the arguin' and cussin' all loud
Sometimes I think you do it just so you can walk out
And you're sayin' plenty things that you really don't mean
Or do you really mean it? 'Cause it hurts...
Then I say some foul shit just so I can hit back
But I don't mean it
We done went too far
Damn I thinks it's over

Next time
I won't throw my heart away, again
I just won't, no I won't
Next time
I won't throw my heart away, again

Seem kinda crazy sayin' you love me so much
How could you bring that woman into our home

Remember this night boy
I scream that oh my god it felt right boy
We got so loud they told us to pipe down
But once we turn it on, can't turn it off

In the morning right before I let you get up
I love you down, and make you where it's hard to get up
For my lips won't miss a spot, then work your way up
Lift me hands, feed up
Make you a believer
A true believer
On your knees believer
Boy I'mma leave praying that this night don't ever end

Tonight the breathe is going deeper
As your knees get weaker

Cuz I can't take my actions back now
Oh, no, what are we gonna do now, the love is so lost, yeah
But I'm calling all night and you ain't pickin' up
Only crime knows where you at
My friend's tellin' me to just let it go
Let you calm, let you take a break

But I won't stress the fame
You know that we're not like that
But you can't go
Cause I'm leaving this time

And I know you really know it baby

The way that you should have been,
And I guess you know I so moved on, once again took a chance to try,
But my heart's still beating... for love.

(See my heart) my heart just wouldn't let me walk away,
(And I knew) I knew if you didn't leave I would have stayed,
(Every day) I couldn't keep pretending everything was ok, (no more hurt)
I don't wish no hurt the way that you hurt me,
There ain't no easy way to let it slip away,
but it was a bitter sweet goodbye.
Cause honestly baby everything was wrong
But you were too caught up to ever notice on your own.

So that I could leave, I did things to make you change your mind... about me,

Cause nothing compares doing that song one more see
How strong these feelings are deep inside

Help the ones who carried on and fight their fight

Maybe one day making it out
Cause your [?] have you to follow through

And I brought my girl Faith... Evans
Along for the ride, Ahh

I've never thought about it, love what I do without it?
Heartaches that I have seen before
I learned enough about it, what I could do without and
I made the vow that I would change
No I just couldn't see what I needed from me
But all these things happened before

If I'll fall in love again, He'll will be more than just a friend

It ended how it ended,
I'm not really trippin', I won't pay attention,
To the lies you had given wasn't really in it
The way that you should have been,
And I guess you know I so moved on, once again took a chance to try,
But my heart's still beating... for love.

(See my heart) my heart just wouldn't let me walk away,
(And I knew) I knew if you didn't leave I would have stayed,
(Every day) I couldn't keep pretending everything was ok, (no more hurt)
I don't wish no hurt the way that you hurt me,
There ain't no easy way to let it slip away,
but it was a bitter sweet goodbye.
Cause honestly baby everything was wrong
But you were too caught up to ever notice on your own.

I made you not love me,
So that I could leave, I did things to make you change your mind... about me,

It's funny how you may never
Know the true effect you may have
On somebody else watching your life
In your eyes they may see dreams and
Hopes and aspirations that might
Help the ones who carried on and fight their fight
In the night they lay and think about
Maybe one day making it out
Cause your [?] have you to follow through

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I just wanna stay beside myself
Sometimes I just wanna go way from myself

I love my baby, I love my baby
So ready

Well, it's a new hit for the radio
Just another jam for the dance floor

I gotta whole new thing goin' on

'Cause leaving you is what I won't do

Ain't nobody else out there for me, for me

Everything we do B-I-G
And I'ma keep it real 'til I D-I-E

Okay, let's go, I'm with it

No lie, I'm telling the truth

Now, baby, take me away

I walk to the door, see your lovely face
All the things I wanna do doesn't want, wanna race, no
Visions of you, on holding me, I can't wait now

Making love baby, I could feel your heart beat

Sent from heaven
Sent from heaven

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last as strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh, no more will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven (ooh, 'cause)
I wanna be the one who you believe

Where were you, when I said I loved you
And where were you when I cried at Night
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you, I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out, I remember when I screamed I hated you
But some how deep inside I deep inside still lovin' you

Sad and lonely

No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love, I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know, where I would go, where I would be

Baby, first of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things
You know that you are guilty of
And I see that it is easy for you to blame everything on me

If that's the case I should go have my fun
And do all the things you say I do
Boy, I can't continue to take this from you

I might as well have cheated you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have given away my love
As much as you accused me, I should have cheated

When you say I was out with somebody else
When my girl told me she saw you with some girl
But I didn't accuse you of something that I didn't see myself
Realize that I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me, you gotta stop accusing me

I might as well have cheated you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
