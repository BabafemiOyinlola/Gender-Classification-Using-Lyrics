Ayoko nang umibig
Ayoko nang lumuha pa
Di na bale wala nang
Sa akin ay magmahal pa

Tibok ng pusong iniwan mo
Kahit ano'y matatanggap ko

O bakit pa iibig
Ayoko Na
Di bale na lang
Ayoko nang umibig
Kung di rin lang ikaw

Oooh

Ayoko nang tumawa

Your sex is got it goin' on

There's so many nasty things I wanna do to you
Lick you up and down and a runnin' around
But a lovely mind could never ever be found

Now you see me and baby, now you don't
Come fast upon me girl

Lick you real good till the very last drop
Ah, no, no, no, no, honey, don't you ever, ever, stop

That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look, in a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took, my body was next

On a mountain, by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with Cupid
The picture's very clear

Hang the sign up on the door
It says, 'Don't disturb this groove'
All I want is just me and you
It's a way to say that I'm so into you

Just, so that I'm understood
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove

Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for the moment

Stand in line, get your tickets, I hope you will attend.
It'll only cost you fifty cents to see.
What life has done to those like you and me.
See the man, with a broken heart you'll see that he is sad.
He hurts so bad.
See the girl who has lost the only love she ever had.

Just come into my arms
While the world goes spinnin' by
In the glow of candlelight
I will show you you're the lady in my life
Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
As long as I know you'll be there, girl
So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine

And baby through the years gonna love you more each day

It don't matter what the season is I still love you

Only you can make it right

Because of the love that you've given to me
Baby once I was blind, but now I can see
I was lost, but I'm found and my spirit is free
All because of your love

I was a stranger in a strange and lonely world
Looking for a lover to be my lady and my friend
You gave me direction and you were there through thick and thin
Because of your love baby I'm back on my feet again, again

I never knew that you would be
The one to fall in love with me
But now I know that I am blessed
You showed me love and tenderness

Because of the love that you've given to me
Baby once I was blind, but now I can see
I was lost, but I'm found and my spirit is free
All because of your love

I've searched all over what my path would find
And girl before your love I was blind
My friends say, "Boy, how do you know it?
How do you know this love is real?"
I say, "Nothing has ever moved me
Nothing has ever quite made me feel"

The way that she touches
The way that she holds me
The way that she kisses
The way she loves me down with all her might
And I know her love is real
You can't tell me what I feel

What kind of love is this you are giving?
Never before has a love been so driven
I'll give you the sun and the moon
And the stars if I could
Just to keep you satisfied, baby
And I know your love is real

Life ain't the same
So much pain inside
Knowing you are out of my life
Out of my life

Life ain't just the same living without you
No one else to blame now that I lost you
Nothing stays the same, everything must change
Now that I've lost you

It was my own decision to be a fool
And think that without you girl I'd still be cool
But I'm so afraid
I don't wanna live this way

Baby, if I told you how much I adore you
Would it mean things better? Would you say whatever?
But if I showed you that I'd like to give it one more try
Would I be making a fool of myself

Oooh, yeah, yeah

1 - I didn't mean to break your heart
I didn't mean to do you wrong
I didn't mean to lie to you
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to

I didn't mean to sex off on you
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to cheat on you
So forgive me for all that I've done

I didn't mean to take for granted
That you would always be right here
I know you heard me say I'm sorry
So many years

But I admit that I was wrong
For leaving you all alone
But now I finally realize
Cuz I see the pain in your eyes

Repeat 1

Girl I hope that you still love me
I'm trying to let you know I've changed
I can't imagine life without you
I'd go insane

I wanna make it up to you
By giving all my love to you
Cuz now I finally understand

Baby, promise that we'll always be
Together, forever

Babe, promise that we'll always be
Don't go, don't go

I'm leaving you this message
I'm sorry that I couldn't be home
But one night while I was out on the road
I didn't spend the night alone, no
I let my weakness get the best of me

I know sometimes it's hard
To put our pride aside
When all we should do is just say
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, baby

All alone in my room
I see visions of you
And I think to myself
What went wrong

As I sit here with my pain
Knowing I'm the one to blame
Had to play those silly games
Now there's no refrain, refrain

1 - I should of listened when you cried
I should of opened up my eyes
Too busy holding on to pride
I didn't hear you say goodbye

2 - So how do I say I'm sorry
When you're gone
How do I say that you were right
And baby I was wrong

I can feel that old black water
Commin' down on me strong
Cuz see, I had a real good something
And now I'm sitting here with nothing
I'm drowning, can somebody help me
Tell me how to say I'm sorry

So yesterday I sat and wrote these words
And tried not to cry

Workin' it like it ain't no thing
Makin' it sweet in the sheets
From your head down to your feet
...
