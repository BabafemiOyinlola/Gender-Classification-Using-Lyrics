I think I found the girl for me
She's a very special lady
And she really cares for me
Like a dream, she's my fantasy come true
Now my search for love is over
Since the day that found you
When we're together, in the passing of the night
There's a fire burning in our heart all bright
Our love is special, it will never fade away
Because the - is one, baby our love is here to stay

Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate, in a very special way
All of our love
Baby our love
Wuh ooh ooh
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate, in a very special way
All of our love
Our love

I, think I found the guy for me
He's a warm and gentle lover

Tumbling dice, seven on 'em, baby
Yeah, come on, yeah
LSG, LSG

When I rise in the morning and face the sunlight
You bounce all my love and it's air tight
Sometimes I'm curious on how you feel
When you're screaming out my name

Is it really for reality, originality, my mentality
Explore every possibility, let's get down
Shorty time will reveal the only true test is pain
You know the deal

Love appears like bright lights in the night sky
Disappears in the blink of a teary eye
That's why I'm C, caught up in your love
U are incredible, your love is a drug

R you the one that can hold me down
I don't know but O I like the sound
U are amazing, there's no doubt
Top it off with a S 'cause you smooth me out

So get ready and let me love you
I got the answer right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
So let me win girl, I wanna know what's on your mind

I'm curious
(About your lovin')
I'm curious
(I wanna know what's on your mind, baby)
I'm curious
(About your lovin', girl)

Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

Don't rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

You and I together
Boy, we made a perfect pair
Till we got those inner feelings
And played those games of truth and dare

No, I'm not one to regret
But I know I did you wrong
And it's so hard to forget
How you loved me all night long

I tried to understand my feelings
Why I ever played on you
In these days of danger
I really should be true

It ain't worth those silly chances
To be a fool whenever I date
From right now to forever
Let's remember this simple phrase

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it don't fit, don't force it
Just chill out and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)

Excuse me
May I have this dance

I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to
Lift my spirits up

So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this sweet lovin' thing was
She was more than enough

I asked her for her hand
Said, "Would you like to dance?"
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we dance and fell in love on a slow jam, yeah, yeah

Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
A slow jam
For my baby and for me, ooh

Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet

Playmates, out to have some fun

Got a little plaything, takes me for a ride
I don't have to tell him how to keep me satisfied
When we're out together, he will stop and stare
That is why we play the game of trick and dare
I'll abide the rules, everybody play
All you've got to do is share a little love today
Just can't be no cheatin', sure you understand
Choose a simple partner, and take him by the hand now

Playmates, out to have some fun
Playmates, I got to having one
Playmates, out to have some fun
Playmates, everybody needs one

Yeah, yeah

Kissin', huggin', lovin' keeps you in the game
Body language sets the page, ignites the flame

Written in these walls are the stories
That I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside

Sometimes I'm curious on how you feel
When you're screaming out my name

Is it really for reality, originality, my mentality
Explore every possibility, let's get down
Shorty time will reveal the only true test is pain
You know the deal

Love appears like bright lights in the night sky
Disappears in the blink of a teary eye
That's why I'm C, caught up in your love
U are incredible, your love is a drug

R you the one that can hold me down
I don't know but O I like the sound
U are amazing, there's no doubt
Top it off with a S 'cause you smooth me out

So get ready and let me love you
I got the answer right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
So let me win girl, I wanna know what's on your mind

Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

Don't rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

You and I together
Boy, we made a perfect pair
Till we got those inner feelings
And played those games of truth and dare

No, I'm not one to regret
But I know I did you wrong
And it's so hard to forget
How you loved me all night long

I tried to understand my feelings
Why I ever played on you
In these days of danger
I really should be true

It ain't worth those silly chances
To be a fool whenever I date
From right now to forever
Let's remember this simple phrase

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it don't fit, don't force it
Just chill out and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)

Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

Don't rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

You and I together
Boy, we made a perfect pair
Till we got those inner feelings
And played those games of truth and dare

No, I'm not one to regret
But I know I did you wrong
And it's so hard to forget
How you loved me all night long

I tried to understand my feelings
Why I ever played on you
In these days of danger
I really should be true

It ain't worth those silly chances
To be a fool whenever I date
From right now to forever
Let's remember this simple phrase

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it don't fit, don't force it
Just chill out and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)

Tumbling dice, seven on 'em, baby
Yeah, come on, yeah
LSG, LSG

When I rise in the morning and face the sunlight
You bounce all my love and it's air tight
Sometimes I'm curious on how you feel
When you're screaming out my name

Is it really for reality, originality, my mentality
Explore every possibility, let's get down
Shorty time will reveal the only true test is pain
You know the deal

Love appears like bright lights in the night sky
Disappears in the blink of a teary eye
That's why I'm C, caught up in your love
U are incredible, your love is a drug

R you the one that can hold me down
I don't know but O I like the sound
U are amazing, there's no doubt
Top it off with a S 'cause you smooth me out

So get ready and let me love you
I got the answer right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
So let me win girl, I wanna know what's on your mind

I'm curious

May I have this dance

I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to
Lift my spirits up

So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this sweet lovin' thing was
She was more than enough

I asked her for her hand
Said, "Would you like to dance?"
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we dance and fell in love on a slow jam, yeah, yeah

Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
A slow jam
For my baby and for me, ooh

Just one-on-one, baby, you and me
Computer freakin' all night long
And you can bet that all my circuits are strong

Just call me up whenever you find the time
We'll get together on the party line
Let's take our time and do it right
We're gonna operate our love tonight

The Midas touch, touch, touch, touch

You say you? re going through changes
Every day it seems your life is up and down
And you say that you? re lookin? for an answer
Everywhere you look it seems you can? t be found

Like searchin?, tryin? to find the rainbow
No one? s ever found it, yet it? s told to be
But if you? re lookin? for a lover
Everything you need, you can find right here with me

I? ve got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I? ve got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Now you? ve been trapped by love
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye
So you say that you? ll never love another
Tired of playin? games and that? s the reason why

But now whenever we? re together
There? s a certain feelin?, that we both agree
And it? s time that you? ve opened up to love
? Cause if you don? t ever try, then baby, you may never see

I've got the power to magnetize
I'll fill you up with my energy
You'll be my toy I'll be your electricity

You've got my head all wired up
It seems I never can't get enough
It feels so good don't you ever stop

You never let me touch and love your body
So won't you come a little closer to me
You'll be my toy I'll be your electricity

Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

Don't rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

You and I together
Boy, we made a perfect pair
Till we got those inner feelings
And played those games of truth and dare

No, I'm not one to regret
But I know I did you wrong
And it's so hard to forget
How you loved me all night long

I tried to understand my feelings
Why I ever played on you
In these days of danger
I really should be true

It ain't worth those silly chances
To be a fool whenever I date
From right now to forever
Let's remember this simple phrase

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)
If it don't fit, don't force it
Just chill out and let it flow

Don't rock that boat (Don't rock that boat, baby)

In the middle of the night I feel your body
Close to mine
Passion
That we engaged I thought would be with us forever
A lifetime

And you say you really need me
And we will always be together
All this time I've been believing
I was making you happy everyday

When I rise in the morning and face the sunlight
You bounce all my love and it's air tight
Sometimes I'm curious on how you feel
When you're screaming out my name

Is it really for reality, originality, my mentality
Explore every possibility, let's get down
Shorty time will reveal the only true test is pain
You know the deal

Love appears like bright lights in the night sky
Disappears in the blink of a teary eye
That's why I'm C, caught up in your love
U are incredible, your love is a drug

R you the one that can hold me down
I don't know but O I like the sound
U are amazing, there's no doubt
Top it off with a S 'cause you smooth me out

So get ready and let me love you
I got the answer right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
So let me win girl, I wanna know what's on your mind
