Welcome 2 the slaughterhouse

Silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
The rope of silicon

One day U'll get outside the doo-rag
When U really want 2 contemplate this, jacked up (Jacked up)Paranormal situation that your people got into
Can I hip U?
Long ago who considered the outcome?
Now I'm thinking that a cat like U would be troublesome
And sock U in the mind tangling curriculum
Guaranteed 2 leave U in a state of delirium
While all along teaching they kids in the valley 2 become unlike U:
broke and dumb

Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon

On a magical rope of silicon
U can bet that they'll be chillin' in Babylon
Thinking about a way that they can split the proton
While U eating all the bloody chicken and dead prawn
Mickey D. shake and a filet mignon
Swearing up and down U the picture of health, now come on!

Just a rope of silicon (Dance)
Just a rope of silicon

All U can hear is the sound of my voice
Every time I touch your face
U gonna fall into a deep sleep
A deep sleep
A deep sleep

U are the reason I believe that I was born
U're always there 2 hold me whenever I am scorned
I'd give my left hand just 2 know your name
Shall I call U "Savior" just the same?

Hypno paradise, oh-oh-oh
Hypno paradise, oh-oh-oh

Am I in heaven or hypno paradise?
This must be heaven cuz hell was never nice
I don't need permission 2 be happy every day
As long as I got a freak like U, I'm straight

Oh paradise

Touch me I'll go under any spell U choose

Positivity is the only way

Chorus:

Love 4 one another is the only sound 2day
Negative people don't get to play

Why you wanna holler when you know what the bible say
Positivity is the only way

Once again when the coin is tossed
And lands upon the sea
Unsuspecting lives are lost
They didn't have to be
When the book is opened
and The Son condemns them all

One day all 7 will die
All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die
And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand, she holds the very key

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come to funk around
'Til I get your daughter, I won't leave this town

In the beginnin', God made the sea
But on the 7th day, He made me
He was tryin' to rest, y'all, when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar, cold gettin' down
I tried to bust a high note but I bust a string
My God was worried 'til He heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only, hurt me

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk, I am a junkie
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got two sides and they both friends

Don't try to clock 'em, they're much too fast
If you try to stop 'em, they'd kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When you hear my music, you'll be havin' fun
That's when I got you, that's when you mine
To tell the truth, tell me what's my line?

No not your body, youe mind you fool
Come here baby, yeah

We're all alone in a villa on the Rivera
That's in France on the south side in case you care
Out of all yoor friends I wanna be the closest
That's why I tell you things so you'll be the mostest

When it comes to life, to be this man's wife
You got to be well educated on the subject of fights
I mean prevention of, in other words

Are you up on this?
If so, then you can get up off hug and a kiss

Tell me what cha eat, I might cook for you
See it really don't matter 'cause it's all about me and you

Now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could, I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

Why can't we just let love decide?

Livin' in the past when they need 2 be livin' the new

Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Brother steady talkin' while the girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock

(Oh yeah)

Pop - punchin' in the rock and roll clock
Talk, guitar talk

Daddy Pop is the writer and love is the book

Morning Papers
He realized that she was new 2 love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass and offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time 4 the morning papers

They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel and ride
Or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe or just one star
Oh, just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers?

Yeah

30, 000 Feet and still a-counting (Live 4 love)
The attack on my plane is steadily mounting (Live 4 love)
They killed my buddy, I'm supposed 2 feel nothing (Live 4 love)
How can I live 4 love?

(I'm calling?) Live 4 love, live 4 love
(I'm calling?) Live 4 love
(Calling?) Live 4 love

Kicked outta my home at 17 (Live 4 love) (Get outta here!)
A real family, now what does that mean? (Live 4 love)
Don't nobody know the trouble I've seen (Live 4 love) (Leave me alone!)
How can I live 4 love?

Don't use that magical, mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love unless you love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love that I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's, baby
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time
(4 all time)
Baby, take a real good look at my face
'Cuz honey, it just might be the last time
Maybe you should've played an ace, instead you played the queen
You'd be better off cheatin' than tryin' 2 read my mind
Don't use that magical, mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love unless you love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love that I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's, baby
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's

I wanna be loved, sugar
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time
(4 all time)
Love me 2 the 9's
Stay awake 4 14 hours
Listen 2 the band play 'New power soul'
We got 2 get with thi
Dancing 2 the beat till we lose our mind control
Can I get a witness?
Lookin' 4 a lover with a body that say some mo'
I wanna see the booty boom
Before I even let her get close enough 2 smell perfume
I'm lookin' 4 a Ph. D.

Morning Papers
He realized that she was new 2 love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass and offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time 4 the morning papers

They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel and ride
Or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe or just one star
Oh, just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers?

Yeah

Where are U?
U can relax now, the max is in control, uh
I Go (this is something 4 nothing), ah yeah yeah

When my back is so far back it's on the other side of the wall
When half a chance is all I get, if I get a chance at all
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the ax - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max, I go

The max-- yo baby, tell me where the party's at (This is something)
The max-- yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
The max - we can dance if U want 2 but I might break your back (Yeah) (This is something)
The max -- MO 4 4 your buck U can bet on that

When they tell me 2 walk a straight line
I put on crooked shoes
When they tell me that I can't live 4ever
I pay some overdues (Dig it)

Lookin' 4 something 2 get us in the mood
I tell each and every one of my friends
That the love we make is really pretty rude
But they don't believe me cuz it's written all over my face
Like Evian and the deep blue sea

Just U and me all night, alright

This is safe sex, (Ooh - I wanna melt with u)

A funky little story about u and me
(Ooh - I wanna melt with u)
Gettin busy 4 awhile
From the tip of my typhoon
(Ooh - I wanna melt with u)
2 the bottom of your ankle chains
We gonna shake and shake and shake
Until we're both deranged
With endorphins
This is the ultimate rave
Ooh - I wanna melt with u
S 2 the S
Slow and slippery, groovy
If we bathe in each other's hips
In other words, get close enough to stick

And I'ma do ya like U wanna...

This is the Continental
This is the main thang

I can see U dancin' 4 a pack of wolves
I can see them fightin’ 4 a chance 2 pull
But they ain't got a shot cuz the way 2 make U hot
Is 2 let U do your own thing instead of tryin’ 2 make U stop

Go on ahead my dear and dance
This is the new romance
Whatever U want 2 do, I'll make it happen fast

I am the Continental, I am the main thang
Whatever come 4 and after me is ying yang
Why settle 4 a star when U can have the sun?
Come on, let me do U like U want 2 be ... done!

Alright, cut! Dissolve 2 a purple floor
U and me are starring in a movie called “More"
3 quarters in a glass, I see U smile and ask
“If I flip 'em on my stomach, will U marry my ass?”

Is it really important where I take my naps?

Or who I sleep with?
People with the real mind will peep this out

Then there goes your clout
Another fool don't know what she talkin' 'bout
Like the woman who tried to approach and attempt to roast

And even boast about how she knew me when
(What'd she say?)

Damn, here we go again
You never went to school as far as I know
And now you're trying to say that you're writing a bio about me?

Girl, I hate to say this, nigga, please

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die
All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand, she holds the very key

In a deep sleep I fell
And the music starts to swell
One of my ribs he took
And it shall be bone of my bones
(Bone of my bones)
And God created woman

And we were naked and did not care
There’s a time to take and a time to share
Two in love, all around and all aware
Flesh of my flesh
(Flesh of my flesh)
And God created woman

Temptation sweet and so much

Surely die if neither one of us shall ye touch
(Shall ye touch)
Then again we could die from the rush

If I don't think about the fact that she left me
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life

U say u'll call me and then u don't
I'll want 2 kiss u and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?

This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration
But I didn't have any dreams
Couple with the fact that u belong 2 another
Whose name is self-righteousness

Cord wrapped around my neck
Epileptic 'til the age of seven
I was sure Heaven marked the deck

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come to funk around
'Til I get your daughter, I won't leave this town

In the beginnin', God made the sea
But on the 7th day, He made me
He was tryin' to rest, y'all, when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar, cold gettin' down
I tried to bust a high note but I bust a string
My God was worried 'til He heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only, hurt me

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk, I am a junkie
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got two sides and they both friends

Don't try to clock 'em, they're much too fast
If you try to stop 'em, they'd kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When you hear my music, you'll be havin' fun
That's when I got you, that's when you mine
To tell the truth, tell me what's my line?
