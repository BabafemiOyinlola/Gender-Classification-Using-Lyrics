Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right

Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh, look out!

Pop pop, it's show time (Show time)
Show time (Show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in (Showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer minks (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (Whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues

Ooh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Oh yeah yeah

Ooh!
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh!
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, For too long
Yeah you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
Oh

He thought me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend (Ah ah ah)

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't

He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
...

Oh I got a bottle full of liquor with a cocaine
Kicker and I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Ooh ooh ooh yeah, you and me baby making love like gorillas

And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice

Can't come back to me, can't come back to me, can't come back to me,

Easily approaching but microphone because I ain't no joke when

Standing at this liquor store
Whisky coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block.(Oh Really)

Tryna scratch my way up to the top.
Because my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose.(No feel up)
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues.(yo)

I'll take one shot for my pain,(oom) One drag for my sorrow.
Get messed up today,(I roll) I'll be ok tomorrow.
One shot for my pain,(who) One drag for my sorrow.(haw)
Get messed up today,(u know me) I'll be ok tomorrow.

For you and your friends
Gotta do it in the penthouse
That's where I keep my pen

What you got a man? I don't see you with him
Put your phone down, let's get it
Forget your Instagram and your Twitter
Got me like woah, wait a minute
You need to take a minute
Loosen them shoulders up
Pour it up, let's work

Throw some perm on your attitude
Girl you gotta relax, ooh

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I don't recognize my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killa on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killa on the run
K-k-killa, k-k-killa, k-k-killa
K-k-killa on the run
Killa on the run
K-k-killa on the run

Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy

Like my daddy, I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice

Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
Cause once I get my hands on her, I'mma ooohh

Shots of patron and it's on, girl

Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is
But I’m a tell you what love is – love is not what you see in the movies
Is not just ecstasy, sex and passion
Love is sacrifice

Always banking my mind that he’s waiting for you,
If you’re crossing the line from this world is true
Now I realised and I know that you’re gone, so gone, ooh
Signs from my God this feeling
Now what I found, this is deeper than life
I know that I get lost in this feeling, ooh
I can see all in me, all in me

We First, Fight and Scream
And It's All Because Of Love
But You And I Both Know We Ain't Never Giving Up!

Everytime I Try To Leave, Somethin' Tells Me, Turn Around
Cause How Could I Ever Leave, The Only One That Holds Me Down (Down)

Cause I Know
We Can Work It Out (Work It Out)
Talk It Out (Talk It Out)
Stick It Out (Stick It Out) Oooh
Everytime I Try To Leave, I Know We Can Figure It Out

And now here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room

Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go - is all the way, ooh baby

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, Baby, baby, please dont go away
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby

You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'

Your poor little heart will end up alone

No one will know, oh, come on girl
Who cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron and it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no

Voice a de called Bruno Mars long side Gong the Zilla(you know me and roll)

Standing at this liquor store
Whisky coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block.(Oh Really)
Lotto tickets and cheap beer That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top.
Because my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose.(No feel up)
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues.(yo)

I'll take one shot for my pain,(oom) One drag for my sorrow.
Get messed up today,(I roll) I'll be ok tomorrow.
One shot for my pain,(who) One drag for my sorrow.(haw)
Get messed up today,(u know me) I'll be ok tomorrow.

And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two
You'll be there

Until you try

You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,
Waiting on the other side

We would live forever
Who could ask for more
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for

You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me

Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
