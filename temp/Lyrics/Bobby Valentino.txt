Bobby Valentino
Tim drop the beat for me
Do it really sexy for me, yeah
Y'all see that girl over there
Hey girl, check this out right here

Say baby what's your story
You got the goods, it's plain to see
The kind that a keep a brother on his knees
And I'm so curious

After the club hang out with me
Valentino is sure to please
For now let's have an apple martini
And get to know each other

Oh ma, tell me
How did you get that in those jeans
The way you poppin', it is killing me
Look over here come follow me

Tell me
How did you get that in those jeans
The way you dropping it is killing me
I'll meet you in the V.I.P.

When you sizzling wanna lay you on the floor
I'm a bad boy just thought I'd let you know
These are the thoughts running through my mind
'Cause I'm so curious, yeah

Couple more shots and we out the door

I slow it down
It's the remix

I can tell you keep yourself up
Hair and nails done plus a good job
Baby, I can tell you from a good home
You're a leader and your head is strong

You're exclusive not many guys
Can say they tapped that
And I like that put your brake on
I'm writing you a ticket
With my name on it plus ten digets

I'm in your city just for the weekend
Relaxation is all I'm seekin'
This walkin' and talkin' ain't doin' it for me
So baby, won't you please turn around?

And slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you

Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you

For a minute it was looking like
I'd end up one of those guys spending my whole life
Looking for a special lady to save me, maybe I'll never be satisfied
Had a couple bad lucks and a couple dimes
Now that I'm looking for you, why you so hard to find?

I thought I took one step, I took two back
I'm not even close this time and that's a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match
So where you at love? I just gotta find you yeah

I wanna know, I wanna know your name
Your name, your name, why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know your name
Your name, your name, why you gotta be anonymous?

Baby, I want you so much
Wanna hold, wanna feel your touch
Come fast girl I'm in a rush
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I wanna know, I gotta know your name
Your name, your name, why you gotta be anonymous?

What's your name?
(Anonymous)
Where you at?
(Anonymous)
When I think about you I get a rush
I wanna meet my Miss Anonymous

Then I see you when I close my eyes
We on borrowed time, I wanna delay the sunlight
Everything I tried to tell you I failed to
Maybe I'll tell you another time
How you keeping me so preoccupied
Gotta strong hold on me, pay me, no, never mind, no

I thought I took one step, I took two back
I'm not even close this time and that's a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match

You know how we do

I saw you walking down on Melrose
You looked like an angel straight out of heaven, girl
I was blown away by your sexiness
Now all I have to do is catch up to you

Slow down
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me

Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

A butterfly tattoo right above your navel
Your belly button's pierced too, just like I like it, girl
Come and take a walk with me, you'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you, it's real, yeah

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe 'cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you
Let's kick it, girl

Yeah, Bobby V, Darkchild, uh
We doin' it like this right here
Check this out, yeah

Can't believe you chose to start the night this way
We were just bout to go out
Then you said wait, baby, no sit down
Baby, girl, I just knew right then

Something was wrong with ya
You said I can't be with ya
Then it started to feel like my heart jumped out my chest
Felt like I lost my breath

This is not how we're supposed to be, baby
The story has just begun
We've only turn the page once
And trust me this is such a beautiful one, baby

You don't have to turn the page
I read the story, it ends with you and me
You don't have to walk away
The story will change, baby, please don't turn the page

You don't have to turn the page
I read the story, it ends with you and me
You don't have to walk away
The story will change, baby, please don't turn the page

You say stay and never leave
You say meant for ever
I could believe you, but I don't

You say we're almost
All alone together all alone
You say, you say you will
I know you won't

I was wrong
I was wrong to ever doubt
I can get along without
I can love my fellow man
But I'm damned if I'll love yours

In a bar that's always closing
In a world where people shout
I don't wanna talk this over
I don't wanna talk it out

Some sad and some happy days
But we still made it thru the rain (yea.yea)

All girls wanna be in yo shoes
