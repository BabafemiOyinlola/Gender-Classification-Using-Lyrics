It's about to be on
It's about to be on

Ya'll came here to give it up
So come on and show me what you got
It's about to be on baby non-stop
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

Nobody but stars in here tonight
Dancing underneath the party light
When I see you working that body right
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

I've been waiting, now I'm ready for the main event
All the ladies and the players in here dressed to kill
Choose a winner who has flavor looking on for style
Only the best can pass the test, let me check you out

In the midst of a fierce competition
Get a view from a better position
A little closer now you got my attention
Maybe your my, my, my, my, my superstar

Keep showing me moves that are blazing
'Cause you're teasing my imagination
Don't believe I can fight temptation
I think you already know that

Ya'll came here to give it up
So come on and show me what you got
It's about to be on baby non-stop
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

I'm glad that you accepted

"Excuse Me Miss, what's your name"
That was the spark that lit the flame

You won't be regrettin' it

Girl, I'm glad that I got you home, tonite
Finally we are alone, tonite

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shinin' star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinkin' of you

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love

A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you
A letter of love but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your, to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh

She called me by surprise I must say
'Cause I never have seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated, surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me Miss, but what's your name, where are you from
And can I come and possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park, I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it

Wait a minute
Let's try something different
This is Luther
With the masters at work

Last night I had some trouble sleeping.

1 - Are you, are you, are you using me?
Are you, are you, are you using me?
Are you, are you, are you using me?
Are you, are you, are you using me?

No more will I let it be
You called his name out in your sleep
You're doing things so suspiciously
And I think that you're using me, yeah

Don't hang on me for security
Love is never free
Are you using me?

Repeat 1

You pretended like we were friends

In the big apple, scars embedded like tattoos
Ghetto love, protection from what's coming at you
Keeping our heads up, maintaining self esteem
And reminiscing on the Harlem Nights scene
We used to party all night
We used to hang out all night like it was all right
Hoping we all might make it through
Doin' what it takes to do to keep it true
I like to reminisce about that night we kissed
It was somewhere in Harlem
The nights were hot and bright, you could treat your honey right
'Coz Sylvia's would burn all night, yeah
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem
Big sister had a group and they'd sit out on the stoop
And Lordy could they harmonize
My cousin Joe could blow just like the radio
And he used to drove them 'B' girls wild
Remember the times we struggled and still held on

Morning
Some of y'all may think
That this next track
A little risky for a Luther joint
But all you gotta do is listen to get it
Get it right
Alright, ch'all, lets start from number one
And get down till it's done

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu
The Pre to the C-I-S-E do

Let's get this thing to workin'
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start it
We all could use the change

Do it till we get it, get it right
Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right
Do it till we get it
Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

Get all up in your back and down your spine

Won't you forgive me for that?

Won't you forgive me, baby?
I'm only human, baby
Won't you forgive me for that?

I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
Is only a heartbeat away
When I need love
I hold out my hand and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Miles and miles of empty space in between us

I just love how long we've known each other
And I know you care about me
But I can't tell just where your life is going

They keep taking your confidence

But I'm keeping my faith in you
Deep in my heart of hearts
You've been worried, puzzled, surrounded by your trouble
But I'm keeping my faith in you

We all cried when your first bow was taken
No one could be prouder of you
But I care more about your heart if it's aching
If I'm your friend, what else can I do?
But those people who hang around

Another sad day, another lonely day
For all we know some people only cry
They have no good times, no poetry rhymes
They don't know how or when or if or why
Why the goodness never stays
Or why love didn't come again today

Isn't there someone who knows they're in trouble
Isn't there someone who sees
I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love
I can be the someone that you need

It was early Sunday morning
Everyone in the house was still asleep
She made some toast and coffee
Took a shower and made herself smell sweet
She said, "I don't want a bus ride,
I believe that the walk might help me think
Got a heart kind of heavy
I need some big hat and gloves, shoes and bag religion!"

Religion
That's my decision
Some of that "make me feel better when I shout!" religion
That's my decision

He was a man usually nice
But something got into him last night
Made him want to fuss and hollar

And it's impossible to erase
Still it scares me when I hear what I hear
You see, everybody's talking and they whisper in my ear

But I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
'Cause nothing's gonna stop our love

In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love"

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had
Since you've come my way

I hope you know, I'd gladly go
Anywhere you'd take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come
And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

Verse 1:
It's the middle of the night
And I can't sleep at all (I'm so uptight)
Tossin' and turnin' is how I've spent the time
I've got so much on my mind... hey
Something's got a hold on me
I think it's love, don't you agree?...(It's got to be)
I don't feel better
I know what I've got to do
I've got to get next to you

Chorus 1:
So I came here (for you to love)
In the pouring rain (for you to love)
And I know I'm ready (for you to love)
I'll be the best I can (honey, for you to love)
'Cause honey it's you I love

Anyone who ever loved could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms and love me too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do

Every time you go away I always say
This time it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back
Without you I'd die dear

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

Said you were gonna be alone

Yeah, I heard you mention
That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go, yes it is

After the dance I walked my baby home under the moonlight
It was a scene, right from my fantasy
She said the things that made me wanna say
How much I love her
(Don't love no other)
It couldn't be, ooh, she's so good to me

And when the morning came around
Well, she had not let me down, she was still my lover
I must confess that I put love to the test
To see if there was any others

She proved to me, oh, what a real good love she'd be
And she was so excited
Deep in her eyes was a promise of the love
That I've been dreaming of, oh
She made me love the world, well
So I know she's my girl

I'm on the cloud where no one is allowed except my lady
High as can be, she's so good to me
Well, I don't care or know what the people down below
Think 'bout my baby, maybe I'm crazy
But it's ecstasy, yeah, she's so good to me

She's so very fine

SHE LOVES ME BACK
Luther Vandross
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)

I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I did everthing that a guy could do
I couldn't do more than that
I felt so helpless
I thought things would never change
Then I saw my girl walking down on the avenue
One day I said, I wanna talk to you

I wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in my eyes
She took me on a natural high
When I said, I love you girl of mine

I mean. It actually happened
Just like this

Yeah

brighter than most of the time
Then love came
out of nowhere, yeah
No thrill will ever be like

That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go, yes it is

You're busted,
You must have fooled me for a while
But honey, as they say
Hit the road
It's all over now

You did me bad
(Over now)
(It's over now)
You treated me so bad

Oh, yes
A kiss in the dark
A certain time I can call you
A letter of love
But no name did you sign
Pretending to all
That we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your
(For your) To be

1-Your secret love
Why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves

My friends told me all about it
They said, I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I 'd get by without it
Until I found this one girl and she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind

See, I used to be such a bad, bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy
And that was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love

I used to know the party people around the world
I gave it up when I found that girl
And she's the one treats me good enough
So I gave it up when I fell in love

Honey, I thought I was justified
To only see the world through my eyes
And that it was a waste of time talkin' 'bout love
But it only took a little time to make me change my mind

THE RUSH
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller

Spoken:
What happened
It seems like every time love comes
You're never ready
That's why they call it...
The Rush

Verse I:
Tell me, tell me are you there
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer
See, I've prayed for peace and love
Like so many of us do
Then I prayed to find someone like you
Up in the morning
Fell out of my bed
Worn out, I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you filled my head
How could it be. (The rush)
This is scaring me

Each time around I tell myself

ignore the signs and risk it all
in the name of love
well i've decided i can't let nobody hurt me again

Are all those feelings that want to touch

What a world for the lonely guy

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him,
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again

When I and my mother would disagree

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

She called me by surprise I must say
'Cause I never have seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated, surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me Miss, but what's your name, where are you from
And can I come and possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park, I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

Missin' you, missin' you, oh... oh...

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby

Yeah... I really do

Long ago
And oh, so far away
I fell in love with you

And you sound so sweet and clear

Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had
Since you've come my way

I hope you know, I'd gladly go
Anywhere you'd take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come
And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved

I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my
In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love"

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

Chorus:
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
Verse 1:
Out of my head to say the things i said
I didn't mean a word
Think jealousy just took a hold of me
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard
(No doubt about it) My heart is in her hands
(With every moment) I'm waiting for a second chance
(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see
I can't face the world if she don't love me

I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
Till I see the mornin' sun

The time is right, you hold me tight
And love's got me high
Please, tell me, 'Yes' and don't say, 'No'
Honey, not tonight

Move a little close to me, you owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait, yeah, yeah

The time is right, turn down the lights
And take my hand, ooh, ooh, yeah
We'll take a flight and spend the night
In the Wonderland

And I need to have you next to me

Creep through your window pane
Because love won't let me wait
Not another minute

Being the toast of the town
What can I say? Hey, hey
But it's strange how your friends
Can sometimes let you fall down

But you and everyone in the world can see
That I'm for real, honey
See I don't know how to fool your heart
I just know what I know and what I know is

I will treat you right
'Cause little darlin' you've got to be mine
I see your love light
We'll have a beautiful time all night

I think about you, you're so fine
And it just might work out
Work, work, if I treat you right

Was when you walked into my life
It was a very special night
When we danced so close

So tender, it gave my heart
The second chance that I'd been waiting for

Our love is falling, all kinds of pressure
Has temptation calling, it gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay 'til the last day

Worry no more, what is love for
I hear love knocking, honey

Got me working overtime

Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you

Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say 'Wow'

Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
One day I was cryin'
'Cause I thought that
Love was something that would
Never come my way, no way

That's when somebody told me not to worry
They said love would surely one day be my friend
And I would never have to be without it again
And it's because

Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true

She said she didn't need to know, ooh, ooh

Just said she'd miss me every minute of the time
She wrote me that on a valentine
That's how I know that I can't stay away too long

Yeah, yeah

In the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of
You and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world that's
A distorted reality
(Nothing's real)

Happiness you
Took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects the hurt I can't
Control

'Cause although you're gone
I keep holdin' on
To the happy times
Ooh when you were mine

Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller
(album: NEVER LET ME GO - 1993)

I could write a book on love
The way you make me feel
I never knew someone
Could have a love so real

Call it a special heart
Call it a love so true
But, in a little while I'm getting close to you

Chorus I:
See, I'm about to lose my mind
(Love is on the way)
I'm so excited, it's a crime
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love
Real love, oh love

To tell them how right they've been
They said you would take me back into your arms again

I GAVE IT UP (WHEN I FELL IN LOVE)
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller

My friends told me all about it
They said I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I could live without it
Until I met this one girl
And she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind

Chorus:
See, I used to be such a bad bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy

One look in your eyes and there I see
Just what you mean to me
Here in my heart I believe
Your love is all I'll ever need
Holdin' you close through the night
I need you, yeah

I look in your eyes and there I see
What happiness really mean
The love that we share makes life so sweet
Together we'll always be
This pledge of love feels so right
And, ooh, I need you

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
(Faithfully)
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee

Your love is all (I need) I need

Yeah yeah
Here it is

She caught me by suprised I must say
Cause I never had seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beatiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fasinated surly
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me miss (YEHHH)
But whats your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can i take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park (YEHHH)
I'll have you home before it's dark (WHOOOO)
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Don't care if i get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact i missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing
I tried my best and i'm going

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants

He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say
Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life
Yeaaah

I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that

I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone

And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you

I'm standing on your doorstep
And I don't know what to do
Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away
My friends all say that you were never true
I'm hiding in the shadows

I hear the music coming out of your radio
Are you there with another guy instead of me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I hear the laughter and there's something I've got to know
Are you there with another guy instead of me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, I would surely die
I'm hiding in the shadows

And I see two silhouettes in back of your window shade
Are you there with another guy when I am gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If you're there with another guy, I can't go on, oh no
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You would never leave me, hurt me or deceive me

We shared a life, we shared a heart
But what we united seems to be breaking apart
It's a haunting pain, goes right to the core
Now we're dividing what's mine from what's yours

I'll keep the same old things I had when we met
And you'll keep what's yours 'cause that would only be fair
But what about the heart that we both created together?

We used to be the toast of the town
We used to have the best love of all
We had blue skies but they came falling down
What happened to us, you and I once were lovers?

A chair is still a chair

And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight

Woah girl

A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home

And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game

Goodbye, so long
Were the last words from you
Seems like you're over

You think that you're strong
You think that you don't
You don't need no one

Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends
Just to see how everyone was doin'
And they said you needed me

Said it was something you'd never admit
But it was hard to see you going through it

Learn to love and you learn to survive
My mistake was thinking love wouldn't catch me
It was the story of my life
I awakened seeing with new eyes
I begged forgiveness, but love wouldn't hear me
Taught you to fear me, baby

Love forgot we used to be just fine
And love forgot about the tender times
Love forgot to ask you if you'd want to give me
Give me one more try
Maybe love forgot this time

Love can't love someone who breaks a vow
But I was not myself, my heart wasn't in it
I still loved you every minute
I could fix it if you show me how

I'd give anything just to trade places with you
So I'm begging heaven down on my knees
To help you make it through

Tell me, can heaven wait
Can heaven wait just one more night

Giving up the shame of my other life
Now I'm seeing things in a whole new light

Especially when I'm alone myself

Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin) to you (To you)
When you call on me (Yeah)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin'

If ever I find that someone special for me
I will do all that I can to keep her in my life
Now I lay me down to sleep and hope that heaven hears my heart
Send me someone right now

I got your love
You need to look no further
Don't you know that
Don't you know that

After my love
You'll never need another
Don't you know that

I don't make no promises I can't keep
And I promised myself that I'd love you forever
How many times must I say that
For you to understand the real thing

Don't you know that I love you so
Baby, don't you know
Don't you know that
I love you so, ooh, don't you know
Don't you know that
Oh

Without a doubt
You are my sweetest inspiration
Don't you know that
Don't you know that

A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart

Roll back the rug everybody, move all the tables and chairs
We're gonna have us a good time tonight
Every time that we meet, we skip and we dip to the beat, yeah
What in the world could be better than getting together again

The last time we had a party, it ended when the sun came up
That's why your mama told you that you couldn't go out (stay in the house)

(aaww), Bad boy, gonna sneak out tonight, he's gonna tip by her window
Cause he sure wants to go out and dance

Everyone's here, let 'em all in (oh yeah)

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

SHE LOVES ME BACK
Luther Vandross
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)

I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I did everthing that a guy could do
I couldn't do more than that
I felt so helpless
I thought things would never change
Then I saw my girl walking down on the avenue
One day I said, I wanna talk to you

I wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in my eyes
She took me on a natural high
When I said, I love you girl of mine
...

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you
Yeah... I really do

Long ago
And oh, so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show

And your guitar
And you sound so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, yeah

There's a whole lot of girls
Messin' around trying to get me

My girl is away they try to upset me

They can't believe I resist how can I hold out
Where is that girl now but the truth really is
I don't worry 'cause I love my baby so

And no matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

If she stays away for long
She calls me on a phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin', head gets the achin'
Is she thinkin' of me or feelin' the fire
With some other guy, yeah

I can't believe I can be worried about her
I shouldn't doubt her
'Cause our thing is for real and I don't worry
'Cause I know, I know, I know

No matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough

Something's going on, it's the middle of the night

I know what's going on girl, you ain't been treating me right
And your sweet talking ain't enough

Yeah, I know you're messing
With at least 2 other guys
You fooled me a long time
But the kid is getting wise, yes I am

Don't hug me, don't kiss me
Don't love me down
Excuse me, but you see
This love affair is over now

You did me bad
(Over now)
(It's over now)
You treated me so bad

Yeah yeah
It's all over baby

I didn't know it when I walked into the house
But you were on the telephone
That's when I heard you tell him to come over tonight
Said you were gonna be alone

Yeah, I heard you mention
That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go, yes it is

You're busted,
You must have fooled me for a while
But honey, as they say
Hit the road

And this is one night that i'll never forget
You see... It was just like in the movies
I mean. It actually happened
Just like this

[Sings]
Yeah
The stars were shining
brighter than most of the time
Then love came
out of nowhere, yeah
No thrill will ever be like
(The night that I fell in love)

You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me

Every time you go away I always say
This time it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back
Without you I'd die dear

Love has truly been good to me

Anywhere you'd take me

I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me

And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow

I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess

Something's got a hold on me
I think it's love, don't you agree?...(It's got to be)

I know what I've got to do
I've got to get next to you

So I came here (for you to love)

It's not your situation

Not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you, you're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you, you're my only world

Just think how long I've known you
It's long for me to own you, lock and key
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion, can't you see?

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you, you're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you, you're my only world

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh

She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away

Excuse me Miss, but what's your name, where are you from

Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that

I thought it was the end

And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone

And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Yeah

And thought she could replace you

Get a view from a better position

And it's all good, so don't you keep it inside
Let it out, do it today
No, no, no, don't you wait
'Cuz it just might be too late
To say "I love you"

Don't walk a mile inside my shoes
'Cuz if you do, you're gonna regret it
Don't take it lightly thinking they might be
Here or there tomorrow

Why you wanna wait, communicate
Don't assume that they already know

ooh, yea
So many times I've seen
So many peoples dreams
Lost and washed away, out to the sea
yeah
I said no not I
pain which should've passed me by
happenin to them but not to me

Hearts get broken all the time
oooh never used to worry bout things like this (I wouldn't worry)
But the trouble is (this time it's mine)
Now I'm worryin (this heart is mine)
see the problem is the heart is mine

Love would be all I need
How nieve could I be
Trusting other people with my care, yeah

I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that

I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone

And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
...

(How)
How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
(Oh, yeah)
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before

How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before

I'm doing all I can to try and understand
Why my feelings faded away
She's been nothin' but good to me
I don't wanna hurt her but I must be free
I can't stay in this love, how do I say goodbye

How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
(No)
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before
 (I don't wanna be here)

How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before

She pretends she cannot see
The love is gone from me
She carries on as if it is what it was before
But I don't love her anymore

I have to let her know

Livin' day to day, the same old things
Enough to make you want to scream
Limited time, border line
Peace of mind is all you need
But I know a place far away
From all the noise and crowded streets
If you jump in the car, it ain't that far
The ride with me is free

Let it flow, let it go, let me get your coat
Baby let it be me
Let me open that door, let me get your seat
Show a little bit of chivalry
Let me kiss you right there
Smellin' your hair, let me hold your hand
Play some soul
Baby let me know
 (I wanna be your man)

Let's make tonight the night
That we ride underneath the stars so high
 (So high)
Let's make tonight the night
That we fall in love if we think it's right
Let's make tonight the night
That we both decide what it's gonna be
Let's make tonight the night
That you fall in love with me finally

You talk about me as if I'm not there
You don't even whisper 'cuz you just don't care
I stand there and listen to my life go by
And at times I wonder why I even try

Well I try because I like to finish what I start
And I have faith it can get better tomorrow
But it won't if you keep treating me
Like I'm invisible

Say that you won't treat me
The way you're treating me
Say that you won't
I see you but you just keep looking right through me
Like someone you don't even see

I'm standing on your doorstep
And I don't know what to do
Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away
My friends all say that you were never true
I'm hiding in the shadows

I hear the music coming out of your radio
Are you there with another guy instead of me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I hear the laughter and there's something I've got to know
Are you there with another guy instead of me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, I would surely die
I'm hiding in the shadows

And I see two silhouettes in back of your window shade
Are you there with another guy when I am gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If you're there with another guy, I can't go on, oh no
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You would never leave me, hurt me or deceive me

Learn to love and you learn to survive
My mistake was thinking love wouldn't catch me
It was the story of my life
I awakened seeing with new eyes
I begged forgiveness, but love wouldn't hear me
Taught you to fear me, baby

Love forgot we used to be just fine
And love forgot about the tender times
Love forgot to ask you if you'd want to give me
Give me one more try
Maybe love forgot this time

Love can't love someone who breaks a vow
But I was not myself, my heart wasn't in it
I still loved you every minute
I could fix it if you show me how

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much

She caught me by suprised I must say
Cause I never had seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beatiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fasinated surly
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me miss (YEHHH)
But whats your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can i take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park (YEHHH)
I'll have you home before it's dark (WHOOOO)
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Regret the fact i missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing

Honey, not tonight

Move a little close to me, you owe it to yourself

And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait, yeah, yeah

The time is right, turn down the lights

We'll take a flight and spend the night
In the Wonderland

Before life removed all the innocence

And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh

The best things in life are free,
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free,
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free

Come on now,
Ooh, yeah

Alright, I like that,
Now, Janet

Ooh, Luther

I know you are my baby, my one and only baby
You said it twice, I'll say it thrice my baby baby baby

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love

And if you wanted the moonlight

I don't worry 'cause I love my baby so

And no matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

If she stays away for long
She calls me on a phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin', head gets the achin'
Is she thinkin' of me or feelin' the fire
With some other guy, yeah

I can't believe I can be worried about her
I shouldn't doubt her

And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess

Are all those feelings that want to touch

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shinin' star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinkin' of you

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)
...

Something's going on, it's the middle of the night
And my ESP woke me up
I know what's going on girl, you ain't been treating me right
And your sweet talking ain't enough

Yeah, I know you're messing
With at least 2 other guys
You fooled me a long time
But the kid is getting wise, yes I am

Don't hug me, don't kiss me
Don't love me down
Excuse me, but you see
This love affair is over now

You did me bad
(Over now)
(It's over now)
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
Yeah yeah
It's all over baby

I didn't know it when I walked into the house
But you were on the telephone
That's when I heard you tell him to come over tonight
Said you were gonna be alone

Yeah, I heard you mention
That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go, yes it is

You're busted,
You must have fooled me for a while
But honey, as they say
Hit the road
It's all over now

You did me bad
(Over now)

You treated me so bad

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love

After the dance I walked my baby home under the moonlight
It was a scene, right from my fantasy
She said the things that made me wanna say
How much I love her
(Don't love no other)
It couldn't be, ooh, she's so good to me

And when the morning came around
Well, she had not let me down, she was still my lover
I must confess that I put love to the test
To see if there was any others

She proved to me, oh, what a real good love she'd be
And she was so excited
Deep in her eyes was a promise of the love
That I've been dreaming of, oh
She made me love the world, well
So I know she's my girl

I'm on the cloud where no one is allowed except my lady
High as can be, she's so good to me
Well, I don't care or know what the people down below
Think 'bout my baby, maybe I'm crazy
But it's ecstasy, yeah, she's so good to me

She's so very fine

SHE LOVES ME BACK
Luther Vandross
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)

I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I did everthing that a guy could do
I couldn't do more than that
I felt so helpless
I thought things would never change
Then I saw my girl walking down on the avenue
One day I said, I wanna talk to you

I wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in my eyes
She took me on a natural high
When I said, I love you girl of mine

I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love

And you don't have to guess

Just to make sure things get stronger

ARE YOU GONNA LOVE ME
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller
(album: ANY LOVE - 1988)

Anywhere you say to be
From the sky down to the ground
If I hear you calling me
I will never let you down
What if I were far away
Would the love fire still burn
I want to know if you would be
Still in love when I return

Are you gonna love me
I'm who I should be when you're loving me
Are you gonna love me
And give this love a chance ...would we dance

I know the way you feel
I shouldn't worry 'bout the future now
It just gets in the way
Don't want to make you sad
Just want to know you're gonna love me
When it's not a sunny day

Are you gonna love me
When the skies are grey and I'm far away

I got up this morning
And without a word of warning
I knew for sure I had to change my way

Dusted my mind to clear it

But it's okay, I'm gonna start today, hey

Emotions disappearing
I call out but you're not here and
I question why I have this debt to pay

But I'll do my best believing
And I'll get that lovin' feeling
I mean to say, I'm gonna start today

Start today to turn this love around
I know for sure I'll never let you down, baby
'Cause no longer do I think, it's all in your mind

I get the point and I've got nothing but time
To be the way, I know I really should be
And find a way for love to rescue me, ooh

(I'm gonna start today)
Working on loving you better
(I'm gonna start today)
Working on leaving you never

(I'm gonna start today)
So baby, dry your tears away, it's okay

Still dream of you returning
My pilot light is burning
I mention you every time that I pray

And I sleep with one eye open
'Cause in my heart I'm hoping

Cuz the minute you hurt love
Then it's over and done

Love don't love you anymore
No more, shoulda never done wrong
Love don't love you anymore
No, no

Love is a ride, up and down, yeah
You did what you did to love
And I betcha know now
Cuz there's no one else around
And now you're running back to me

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh

One thing I would love to do
Is talk to someone
Wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust
What's gonna happen

The first thing I know
God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure

I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you

Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say 'Wow'

That's how I know it'll all work out

And can't a thing ever bring us down
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not 'cause I remember you

Scared of tomorrow, scared of right now too
See, it's all very sad, can't deny you feel bad
But I just don't want you to let this thing take you over

LOVE IS ON THE WAY (Real Love)
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller
(album: NEVER LET ME GO - 1993)

I could write a book on love
The way you make me feel
I never knew someone
Could have a love so real

Call it a special heart
Call it a love so true
But, in a little while I'm getting close to you

Chorus I:
See, I'm about to lose my mind
(Love is on the way)
I'm so excited, it's a crime
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love
Real love, oh love

Calling up all my friends
To tell them how right they've been
They said you would take me back into your arms again
...

One look in your eyes and there I see
Just what you mean to me
Here in my heart I believe
Your love is all I'll ever need
Holdin' you close through the night

I look in your eyes and there I see
What happiness really mean
The love that we share makes life so sweet
Together we'll always be
This pledge of love feels so right
And, ooh, I need you

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully

You're all I need
Here and now

How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you

What you think, am I still your guy?
I'm so confused, my darling, I could die

You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you

Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say 'Wow'
Heaven brought us together
That's how I know it'll all work out

We built our love on a solid ground
And can't a thing ever bring us down
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not 'cause I remember you

You're still the one on my mind
Love is working overtime

A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you
A letter of love but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby

Just to have something to do
Then I saw a different you
And o-o-h, my

There's so many stories of love
All with the wonders of love
And so very sad I would be
'Cause none belonged to me

Could be it's all for the voice
So I finally let it rest
Sad but I thought that maybe
Love wasn't meant for me

There was love

There was love

Side of the world

So much love

Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star

SHE DOESN'T MIND
Luther Vandross and Reed Vertelney

For love you pay the price
You give it up, you sacrifice
And if necessary you compromise
Sometimes it's bitter sweet

To create a good enough love to keep
You see hearts belong to fire
So does her love
She burns me up with desire

My girl's love is right on time
Sweet and sweet and ever kind
She's so fine

We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
(She doesn't, she doesn't)
(She don't mind)

I did my best, please understand
I was late for one of our evening plans
Champagne, dinner for two
With candlelight, she set the mood
But there wasn't anything I could do

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

But I don't wanna be holdin' you

In these arms for all eternity

I don't mean to put your under pressure
I just wanna spend some time together
And baby, if it's just for one night

Then give me just one night with you

Give me just one night with you

Third time, there won't be one

Third time, honey, dream on

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

Is talk to someone

Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust

God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh

When you make things up I can tell you lie

And I wonder what kind of man is he
The one who you say is your lover
Who you insist takes care of you under the covers
And who is there for you and loves you like no other
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother

If I didn't know better

I'd think that you were mine, you're with me all the time
If I didn't know better
I'd swear we're more than friends, you're touching me again

We shared a life, we shared a heart
But what we united seems to be breaking apart
It's a haunting pain, goes right to the core
Now we're dividing what's mine from what's yours

I'll keep the same old things I had when we met
And you'll keep what's yours 'cause that would only be fair
But what about the heart that we both created together?

We used to be the toast of the town
We used to have the best love of all
We had blue skies but they came falling down
What happened to us, you and I once were lovers?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me

And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow

But I don't wanna be holdin' you

In these arms for all eternity

I don't mean to put your under pressure
I just wanna spend some time together
And baby, if it's just for one night

Then give me just one night with you

One kiss in the morning
After a hundred kisses each night

Give me just one night with you
Everyday for all time
It would be so right
Everyday to have just one night with you (With you, hey, hey)

'Cause you won't pay nothin' for this good lovin', it's for free

And I won't make you promises,
I'll just do all I can to be your lover 'cause I understand

The best things in life are free,
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free,
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free

Come on now,
Ooh, yeah

Alright, I like that,
Now, Janet

Ooh, Luther

I know you are my baby, my one and only baby
You said it twice, I'll say it thrice my baby baby baby

One thing I would love to do
Is talk to someone
Wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust
What's gonna happen

The first thing I know
God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
Oh yeah

My first love (yeah)
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

(Oh)
And I (And I)
I want to share
All my love with you, hey yeah
No one else will do
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You will always be
My endless love
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true, yeah

And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
'Cause we got a life of love

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you
A letter of love but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your, to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Well, once again my love, it's time for you to go
No need to explain anything, I know, I know, I know
This is the end of the road, it's the parting of the ways
And there's not much left for us to say

You keep telling me he's no good for you
You said you were gonna change your lock
You told me if he bothers you again, baby
He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Put him away, baby
Make him understand
Tell him his game is over
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder

Whatever you're going through
I can make it better
No one should be making you feel like you do
I can make it better

And oh, baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Tell him you wanna be free, you wanna love me
Don't let him get in the way, hey, hey, yeah

For every one time that he gives you pleasure
Ten times he makes you wanna cry
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Ay, love don't love you
Hey, love, ah ha

Time rushes on
And it's not fair
When someone you used to love
Is no longer there
But I think it's time you know
See love is a society
Any fool can not belong
Cuz the minute you hurt love
Then it's over and done

Love don't love you anymore
No more, shoulda never done wrong
Love don't love you anymore
No, no

Love is a ride, up and down, yeah
You did what you did to love
And I betcha know now
Cuz there's no one else around
And now you're running back to me

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens

Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

To dream the impossible dream

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much

Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

This time it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back
Without you I'd die dear

I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away

And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time

She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

And you don't have to guess

Now all you need is a chance to try any love"

Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out, hey
Are all those feelings that want to touch any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind, my mind

And oh, everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
And oh, everybody feels alone without any love, any love

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone

And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Here it is

She called me by surprise I must say
'Cause I never have seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated, surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me Miss, but what's your name, where are you from
And can I come and possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park, I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

I thought some time alone
was what we really needed.
You said this time would hurt more than it helped,
but I couldn't see that.
I thought it was the end
of a beautiful story,
and so I left the one I love at home
to be alone, ooh oh
And I tried and found out this one thing is true,
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh

One look in your eyes and there I see
Just what you mean to me

And, ooh, I need you

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much

Oh, my love

You have come
And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow

I had known you for quite sometime
But the thought of love
Never crossed my mind

On the other side of the world

To many times had I loved
And not cared at all about love
Just to have something to do
Then I saw a different you
And o-o-h, my

There's so many stories of love
All with the wonders of love
And so very sad I would be
'Cause none belonged to me

Could be it's all for the voice
So I finally let it rest
Sad but I thought that maybe
Love wasn't meant for me

There was love
There was love
There was love
On the other
Side of the world

So much love

I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess

SHE DOESN'T MIND
Luther Vandross and Reed Vertelney

For love you pay the price
You give it up, you sacrifice
And if necessary you compromise
Sometimes it's bitter sweet
You've got to try eight days a week
To create a good enough love to keep
You see hearts belong to fire
So does her love
She burns me up with desire

Chorus I:
My girl's love is right on time
Sweet and sweet and ever kind
She's so fine
(She doesn't, she doesn't)
(She don't mind)
Even when I come home late at night
We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
(She doesn't, she doesn't)
(She don't mind)

It was out of my hands
I did my best, please understand
I was late for one of our evening plans
Champagne, dinner for two
With candlelight, she set the mood
But there wasn't anything I could do

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart

Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had
Since you've come my way

I hope you know, I'd gladly go
Anywhere you'd take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come
And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved

Yesterday was the first time
That I didn't hear from you
Almost felt like the world ended
And what was I to do
Cause you're the one for me
And only you can be
My love fantasy
You lift me up higher
You're who I desire
I just love what you do to me
And oh. Don't leave me waiting too long

Come back and
[see me]
You need love baby
I need love baby

Oh baby oh yay eh ah-eh!

I can't hide my emotions
It never turns out right
And without you there was no-one
To get me through the night
Well I have never felt so much
For anybody else's touch

And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
Verse 1:
Out of my head to say the things i said
I didn't mean a word
Think jealousy just took a hold of me
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard

(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see
I can't face the world if she don't love me

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

Said you were gonna be alone

Yeah, I heard you mention
That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go, yes it is

She proved to me, oh, what a real good love she'd be
And she was so excited
Deep in her eyes was a promise of the love
That I've been dreaming of, oh

And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved

I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess

Chorus:
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
Verse 1:
Out of my head to say the things i said
I didn't mean a word
Think jealousy just took a hold of me
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard
(No doubt about it) My heart is in her hands
(With every moment) I'm waiting for a second chance
(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see
I can't face the world if she don't love me

Chorus:
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)

I used to be afraid
That you were never gonna love me this way
But I feel better now
No one could ever say
To me, it's such a shame you're a lonely guy
Because you love is mine

And now we know our love is ever so true
I think we know it 'cause you feel the way I do
I can't imagine me without you, my dear
And I'm so glad about the reason that you came here

Because it's love
Because it's love
Because it's really love
Because it's really love

Ooh, girl you gotta stay
'Cause I wanna fill your day with happiness
'Cause I'm in love you see
There's so much I wanna say
And you'll hear the words to make you fall in love
Deep in love with me

I used to say I love you every day
To make you really know, to trust in the things I say
But look at me now and you can clearly see
The love I feel for you, you don't need words from me

Because it's love

Anyone who ever loved could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms and love me too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do

Every time you go away I always say
This time it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back
Without you I'd die dear

SHE DOESN'T MIND
Luther Vandross and Reed Vertelney

For love you pay the price
You give it up, you sacrifice
And if necessary you compromise
Sometimes it's bitter sweet
You've got to try eight days a week
To create a good enough love to keep
You see hearts belong to fire
So does her love
She burns me up with desire

Chorus I:
My girl's love is right on time
Sweet and sweet and ever kind
She's so fine
(She doesn't, she doesn't)
(She don't mind)
Even when I come home late at night
We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
(She doesn't, she doesn't)
(She don't mind)

It was out of my hands
I did my best, please understand
I was late for one of our evening plans
Champagne, dinner for two
With candlelight, she set the mood
But there wasn't anything I could do
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

I got up this morning
And without a word of warning
I knew for sure I had to change my way

Dusted my mind to clear it
My body and my spirit
But it's okay, I'm gonna start today, hey

Emotions disappearing
I call out but you're not here and
I question why I have this debt to pay

But I'll do my best believing
And I'll get that lovin' feeling
I mean to say, I'm gonna start today

Start today to turn this love around
I know for sure I'll never let you down, baby
'Cause no longer do I think, it's all in your mind

I get the point and I've got nothing but time
To be the way, I know I really should be
And find a way for love to rescue me, ooh

Working on loving you better
(I'm gonna start today)
Working on leaving you never

So baby, dry your tears away, it's okay

Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer?

Each time around I tell myself

One day I'll always remember
Was when you walked into my life
It was a very special night
When we danced so close

So tender, it gave my heart
The second chance that I'd been waiting for

Our love is falling, all kinds of pressure
Has temptation calling, it gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay 'til the last day

Worry no more, what is love for
I hear love knocking, honey

She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me miss (YEHHH)
But whats your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can i take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park (YEHHH)
I'll have you home before it's dark (WHOOOO)
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Regret the fact i missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing

I thought some time alone
was what we really needed
you said this time would hurt more than it helps
but I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
of a beautiful story
and so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)
and I tried and found
out this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone

And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game

He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Put him away, baby

Tell him his game is over
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder

Whatever you're going through

No one should be making you feel like you do

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess

I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my
In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love"

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

Chorus:
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
Verse 1:
Out of my head to say the things i said
I didn't mean a word
Think jealousy just took a hold of me
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard
(No doubt about it) My heart is in her hands
(With every moment) I'm waiting for a second chance
(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see
I can't face the world if she don't love me

I think I dream about you most of the time
What can I say? Hey, hey
But I don't see you much
It's only once in a while
I wanna know what you feel

I used to hang around
Being the toast of the town
What can I say? Hey, hey
But it's strange how your friends
Can sometimes let you fall down

But you and everyone in the world can see
That I'm for real, honey
See I don't know how to fool your heart
I just know what I know and what I know is

I will treat you right
'Cause little darlin' you've got to be mine
I see your love light
We'll have a beautiful time all night

I think about you, you're so fine
And it just might work out
Work, work, if I treat you right
My, my, my, my baby

I wanna keep you close to the heart
What can I say? Hey, hey
So I know, you will never ever, never go far
'Cause I can feel if it's real

One look in your eyes and there I see

What happiness really mean
The love that we share makes life so sweet
Together we'll always be
This pledge of love feels so right
And, ooh, I need you

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
(Faithfully)
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee

Your love is all (I need) I need

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

Loving you the way I do I'd take you back
Without you I'd die dear

But Ooh, I love you

But I'm keeping my faith in you
Deep in my heart of hearts
You've been worried, puzzled, surrounded by your trouble
But I'm keeping my faith in you

We all cried when your first bow was taken
No one could be prouder of you
But I care more about your heart if it's aching
If I'm your friend, what else can I do?
But those people who hang around

Another sad day, another lonely day
For all we know some people only cry
They have no good times, no poetry rhymes

Why the goodness never stays
Or why love didn't come again today

Isn't there someone who knows they're in trouble
Isn't there someone who sees
I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love
I can be the someone that you need

It was early Sunday morning
Everyone in the house was still asleep
She made some toast and coffee
Took a shower and made herself smell sweet
She said, "I don't want a bus ride,
I believe that the walk might help me think
Got a heart kind of heavy
I need some big hat and gloves, shoes and bag religion!"

Religion
That's my decision
Some of that "make me feel better when I shout!" religion
That's my decision

Papa Henry was full of spice
He was a man usually nice
But something got into him last night
Made him want to fuss and hollar
The entire house was in a sweat

Morning
Some of y'all may think
That this next track
A little risky for a Luther joint
But all you gotta do is listen to get it
Get it right
Alright, ch'all, lets start from number one
And get down till it's done

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu
The Pre to the C-I-S-E do

Let's get this thing to workin'
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start it
We all could use the change

Do it till we get it, get it right
Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right
Do it till we get it
Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

Get all up in your back and down your spine

And I know it's just a rumor spreading in this town
And I know know know it's a thing I don't believe
'Cause you know I'd never let you down baby
This is love that you see on my face
And it's impossible to erase
Still it scares me when I hear what I hear
You see, everybody's talking and they whisper in my ear

But I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
'Cause nothing's gonna stop our love
Honey don't you see?

I know about their jealousy

Hoping we all might make it through

Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem

Keeping me warm night and day

My friends told me all about it
They said, I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I 'd get by without it
Until I found this one girl and she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind

See, I used to be such a bad, bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy
And that was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love

I used to know the party people around the world
I gave it up when I found that girl
And she's the one treats me good enough
So I gave it up when I fell in love

Honey, I thought I was justified
To only see the world through my eyes

THE RUSH
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller

Spoken:
What happened
It seems like every time love comes
You're never ready
That's why they call it...
The Rush

Verse I:
Tell me, tell me are you there
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer
See, I've prayed for peace and love
Like so many of us do
Then I prayed to find someone like you
Up in the morning
Fell out of my bed
Worn out, I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you filled my head
How could it be. (The rush)
This is scaring me

SHE DOESN'T MIND
Luther Vandross and Reed Vertelney

For love you pay the price
You give it up, you sacrifice
And if necessary you compromise
Sometimes it's bitter sweet
You've got to try eight days a week
To create a good enough love to keep
You see hearts belong to fire
So does her love
She burns me up with desire

Chorus I:
My girl's love is right on time
Sweet and sweet and ever kind
She's so fine
(She doesn't, she doesn't)
(She don't mind)
Even when I come home late at night
We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
(She doesn't, she doesn't)
(She don't mind)

It was out of my hands
I did my best, please understand
I was late for one of our evening plans
Champagne, dinner for two
With candlelight, she set the mood
But there wasn't anything I could do
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it
...

I got up this morning
And without a word of warning
I knew for sure I had to change my way

Dusted my mind to clear it
My body and my spirit
But it's okay, I'm gonna start today, hey

Emotions disappearing
I call out but you're not here and
I question why I have this debt to pay

But I'll do my best believing
And I'll get that lovin' feeling
I mean to say, I'm gonna start today

Start today to turn this love around
I know for sure I'll never let you down, baby
'Cause no longer do I think, it's all in your mind

I get the point and I've got nothing but time
To be the way, I know I really should be
And find a way for love to rescue me, ooh

Working on loving you better
(I'm gonna start today)
Working on leaving you never

So baby, dry your tears away, it's okay

Still dream of you returning

I mention you every time that I pray

And I sleep with one eye open

Each time around I tell myself

One day I'll always remember
Was when you walked into my life
It was a very special night
When we danced so close

So tender, it gave my heart
The second chance that I'd been waiting for

Our love is falling, all kinds of pressure
Has temptation calling, it gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay 'til the last day

Worry no more, what is love for
I hear love knocking, honey
Come on, open the door

You know you've got me to love

Let me tell you that

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Don't care if i get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact i missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing
I tried my best and i'm going

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say
Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes

LOVE IS ON THE WAY (Real Love)
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller
(album: NEVER LET ME GO - 1993)

I could write a book on love
The way you make me feel
I never knew someone
Could have a love so real

Call it a special heart
Call it a love so true
But, in a little while I'm getting close to you

Chorus I:
See, I'm about to lose my mind
(Love is on the way)
I'm so excited, it's a crime
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love
Real love, oh love

Calling up all my friends
To tell them how right they've been
They said you would take me back into your arms again
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Heaven knows I love you
Heaven knows how much I care
Couldn't live without you
Look for me and I'll be there

But even though you're a joy to me
I think you think, "He's a bore to me"
What you think, am I still your guy?
I'm so confused, my darling, I could die

You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you

Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say 'Wow'
Heaven brought us together
That's how I know it'll all work out

We built our love on a solid ground
And can't a thing ever bring us down
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not 'cause I remember you

You're still the one on my mind
Love is working overtime

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

Love has truly been good to me

I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me

Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again

A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you
A letter of love but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your, to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in

Looking? round for the warmth of the light
There was fog on the road
So I guess no one saw me arriving

I was tired and awake for some time
Then my lights hit a welcoming sign
It said if you're alone
You can make this your home
If you want to, oww

Searching, searching
(For so long)
Searching

Searching, searching

Stepped outta the night
It was brighter inside
Someone come and asked me my name
Taken back by surprise

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

If she stays away for long
She calls me on a phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright

Is she thinkin' of me or feelin' the fire
With some other guy, yeah

I can't believe I can be worried about her
I shouldn't doubt her

It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you

Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby

I was fascinated, surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me Miss, but what's your name, where are you from
And can I come and possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park, I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my
In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love"

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

What good is the money when lately we've been missin' each other?
'Cause we've got work and kids, you know how it goes
Monday through Friday, nine to five
We spend most of the time chasin' that dough

But not tonight, we're gonna both get fly
Call your momma, tell her come over so we can have quality time
'Cause it's been too long since I held you in my arms
I can't wait no more, I'm ready to ooh

You make me wanna do thangs, do thangs
Them grown thangs, do thangs with you, ooh
Tonight we gon' forget our worries
Put the kids to bed, I'm goin' out instead with you, ooh

Girl, put that celly down, don't even peek at your pager now
Just chill, relax, the kids will be cool
Grab two more Cosmos, we ain't thinkin' about tomorrow
We're in a club full of people but it feels just like me and you

Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin) to you (To you)
When you call on me (Yeah)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin'

If ever I find that someone special for me

Now I lay me down to sleep and hope that heaven hears my heart
Send me someone right now

Ey, hey, yea

I don't wanna put no chains on you
I just wanna be here lovin' you
‘Cause you touch me in a place
That puts a smile right on my face

But I don't wanna be holdin' you
Baby, only for an hour or two
I want you with me
In these arms for all eternity

I don't mean to put your under pressure
I just wanna spend some time together
And baby, if it's just for one night

Then give me just one night with you
Everyday of your life
One kiss in the morning
After a hundred kisses each night

Give me just one night with you
Everyday for all time
It would be so right
Everyday to have just one night with you (With you, hey, hey)

Wait a minute, this is where I draw the line
Tell me what's got into you 'cause apparently you've lost your mind
Repetitious fault just can't be overlooked
So I'm reading you your rights in case you misunderstood

The first time, a mistake
Second time, a bad decision
Third time, there won't be one
'Cause I won't let you do that to me

The first time, a mistake
Second time, a bad decision
Third time, honey, dream on
'Cause I won't let you do that to me

Don't think I haven't checked out all your alibies
And the evidence concludes that you're just telling me half the truth
Still I keep giving you the benefit of doubt
'Cause I fell so deep in love with you, I struggle to get around

Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer?

I GAVE IT UP (WHEN I FELL IN LOVE)
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller

My friends told me all about it
They said I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I could live without it
Until I met this one girl
And she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind

See, I used to be such a bad bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy

Love, what have you done

but I don't anymore
she said i'm a bore
my heart hit the floor
(don't be a fool again)

Each time around I tell myself
it's the game of love
ignore the signs and risk it all
in the name of love
well i've decided i can't let nobody hurt me again
so I'll say it til the end
i just don't want to be a fool

said i don't want to be a fool ever again

Sorry you can't buy my kisses
Open your eyes and see
True love comes for free

I'm keepin' my heart open
Hopin' you won't stab me in it
'Cause I've been in love before
When I had to pay I didn't

I lose my sanity
Tryin' to measure your intentions
What do you want from me
How much will it be?

No more than I'm willin' to give (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you won't pay nothin'
For this good lovin' (Alright), it's for free

And I won't make you promises [Uh-uh]
I'll just do all I can
To be your lover 'cause I understand

One thing I would love to do
Is talk to someone
Wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust
What's gonna happen

The first thing I know
God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure

How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again

Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...
Girl

A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart

I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that

I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone

And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you

I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my
In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love"

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

Oh oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah, yeah yeah

So close to paradise but closer than I should be
It's like I'm along for the ride, it happened unexpectedly
Promised myself that I wouldn't ever love again
But you make me feel something, my mind's always on you

I was standing in the rain
(I thought about you)
I was riding on the train
(I thought about you)
Feeling high like I seem to do
Every time I think about you

Saw two lovers start to kiss
(I thought about you)
Had to hold back the tears
(I thought about you)
Other girls no more exist
All because I think about you

Nothing seems to help, I don't even know myself
I'm trying not to think of you but a heart does what it wants to do
Pass you by, see you smile and I must admit I get
So emotional, I think I'm falling for you

Bought a pillow for my room
(I thought about you)
Heard Alicia sing a tune
(I thought about you)
It sends my rocket to the moon
(Every time I think about you)
Happens every time oh

Right from this heart of mine
(I thought about you)
I wanted you every time

A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you
A letter of love but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your, to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby

The closer I get to you 
The more you make me see 
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more) 
Your love has captured me 


Over and over again 
I try to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real 
The way you make me feel 

Lyin' here next to you

Needing you more and more (More and more)

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say
Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life
Yeaaah
Now the days have grown

Get a view from a better position
A little closer now you got my attention
Baby you're my, my, my, my, my superstar
Keep showing me moves that are blazing
Cause you're teasing my imagination
Don't believe I can fight temptation

Quarter after seven, got a phone call
Telling me to get here quick
Said "Your girl is in a bad situation
They don't know if she's gonna make it"

As I hurry to be by her side
I ask a thousand times, why oh why
There's no rhyme or reason in my life
With you lying here this way

I'd give anything just to trade places with you
So I'm begging heaven down on my knees
To help you make it through

Tell me, can heaven wait
Can heaven wait just one more night
Tell me what it's gonna take
To keep you with me in my life

Giving up the shame of my other life
Now I'm seeing things in a whole new light
Lord, I vow to change if you just make it right

They can't believe I resist how can I hold out

I don't worry 'cause I love my baby so

And no matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

If she stays away for long
She calls me on a phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin', head gets the achin'
Is she thinkin' of me or feelin' the fire
With some other guy, yeah

I can't believe I can be worried about her
I shouldn't doubt her

I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in

Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh

Anywhere you'd take me

I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me

You have come
And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow

Think jealousy just took a hold of me
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard

Don't let him try to take you from me

I don't wanna feel I've been penalized
Just 'cause I can drive in a better car
Live in a bigger house just like a superstar

Material things, but that's not true
You see my heart is rich with love for you
Don't let him make you doubt my love for you
Yeah, baby
I work hard for my money
No one gave it to me

The smaller the heart will be, not true

Not all bad, not all good

Not all cold, not all hot
(Yeah, I like that, not all hot)

Not all bitter, not all sweet

So don? t miss all the good, waiting for the best
There? s still happiness, right in the middle

Perfect love sounds real nice
But that never seemed to happen
With any relationship of mine
It was always up and down, in then out

And after the last goodbye
I still didn? t know what it was all about
You get disappointed if it ain? t bliss all the time

We shared a life, we shared a heart
But what we united seems to be breaking apart
It's a haunting pain, goes right to the core
Now we're dividing what's mine from what's yours

I'll keep the same old things I had when we met
And you'll keep what's yours 'cause that would only be fair
But what about the heart that we both created together?

We used to be the toast of the town
We used to have the best love of all
We had blue skies but they came falling down
What happened to us, you and I once were lovers?

What's up my people?
You know
I am your weather man Busta Rhymes
I've come today to give you your weather forcast
you know today looks like one of those beautiful days
you know? to be perfectly honest,
there aint a cloud in the sky
you know this is the kind of weather you take your girl to the beach
lay her down and talk to her
Luther, step to the microphone

When i wake up in the morning love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
something strange without a one in love
That is heavy on my mind
then i look at you
and the world is alright with me
just one look at you
and i know it's gonna be

a lovely day
oohh.
a lovely day
it's gonna

Goodbye, so long
Were the last words from you
Seems like you're over
All the goodness we knew

You think that you're strong
You think that you don't
You don't need no one

Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends
Just to see how everyone was doin'
And they said you needed me

Said it was something you'd never admit
But it was hard to see you going through it
They said you needed me

I thought some time alone
was what we really needed
you said this time would hurt more than it helps
but I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
of a beautiful story
and so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)
and I tried and found
out this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone

The bad boy's swingin' (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Oh Yeah (Do doobie, doobie, de, de)
Well alright, (Do doobie, doobie, de, de) oh yeah
(Yeah) Well alright, (Whoa, ey)
oh yeah (bad boy's swingin') (Do doobie, dwiddle, de, de)
Well alright, (Dwiddle, de, Dwiddle, de, Dwiddle, de)
oh yeah (Do, do, do, de, do, yeah)

Roll back the rug everybody, move all the tables and chairs
We're gonna have us a good time tonight
Every time that we meet, we skip and we dip to the beat, yeah
What in the world could be better than getting together again

The last time we had a party, it ended when the sun came up
That's why your mama told you that you couldn't go out (stay in the house)

(aaww), Bad boy, gonna sneak out tonight, he's gonna tip by her window
Cause he sure wants to go out and dance

Everyone's here, let 'em all in (oh yeah)

Dear Diana, I know I've said this before
But I'm sure this time
It's really love

The world's sweetest lady
Lives around my way
And I think that I'm in love

Hey there, sweet one
You don't know what you've done
I was once so lonely

Now, I only think of love
Of love, sweet love
And you're the sweetest one

(The sweetest one)
I've ever known
(Sugar and honey)
You're the one

(You are the one)
The sweetest love
(The sweetest one and only)

I'm in love forever
With the sweetest lady
And I know she love me too

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)

FOREVER, FOR ALWAYS, FOR LOVE
Luther Vandross

Spoken:
I sing this song
To remind myself that

There was a time when I
Didn't have no one
Didn't have no love
Do you remember
The love that we once had
Well, if I had the chance to love you again
I would make your heart forget I was ever bad

PROMISE ME
Luther Vandross
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
So when it comes to our love
I'll talk the whole night through
About the lovin' I've been missin'
Lately, baby I ain't had no kissin'
Don't you love me
Can we stay together

Bridge:
Like when we used to be in love

SHE LOVES ME BACK
Luther Vandross
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)

I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I did everthing that a guy could do
I couldn't do more than that
I felt so helpless
I thought things would never change
Then I saw my girl walking down on the avenue
One day I said, I wanna talk to you

I wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in my eyes
She took me on a natural high
When I said, I love you girl of mine
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
One day I was cryin'
'Cause I thought that
Love was something that would
Never come my way, no way

That's when somebody told me not to worry
They said love would surely one day be my friend
And I would never have to be without it again
And it's because

Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shinin' star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinkin' of you

I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
...

Something's going on, it's the middle of the night
And my ESP woke me up
I know what's going on girl, you ain't been treating me right
And your sweet talking ain't enough

Yeah, I know you're messing
With at least 2 other guys
You fooled me a long time
But the kid is getting wise, yes I am

Don't hug me, don't kiss me
Don't love me down
Excuse me, but you see
This love affair is over now

You did me bad
(Over now)
(It's over now)
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
Yeah yeah
It's all over baby

I didn't know it when I walked into the house
But you were on the telephone
That's when I heard you tell him to come over tonight
Said you were gonna be alone

Yeah, I heard you mention
That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go, yes it is

You're busted,
You must have fooled me for a while
But honey, as they say
Hit the road
It's all over now

You did me bad
(Over now)
(It's over now)
You treated me so bad
