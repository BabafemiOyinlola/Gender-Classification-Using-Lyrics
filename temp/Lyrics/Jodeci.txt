Promises you made me
All the things you told me
You said you'd never leave me
We'll be together for eternity
Now it's all in the past
Now I know our love will last
Lady I will do all I can
Lady I would be all I am

(Pre-)
I'll give you all you've had before
So come on in and close the door
Let me show you what I could be
Could you just please tell me

Lately I've had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
But yet the thought of losing you been hanging
Around my mind, K-CI sing it

Far more frequently your wearing perfume
With you say the special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know never know

Oh I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses but what I really feel

Too hot, she's hot, melt, sex, too hot
Too hot, she's hot, gets all of that
Too hot, she's hot, that's a fact
Too hot, she's hot, that's that

You can see it in her eyes, baby got that fire
Pretty face like Lauren, body like mine
I hit her with the stud pass and I'ma ride it
Hit her good, have her screamin' high notes like Mariah
Hold up, and watch her shut it down, say watch her shut it down
These other hoes know they gotta go when she come around
Say my name, say my name so I know it's me
You got a nigga feenin' like Jodeci, turn up

All my niggas know, when she hits the floor
That she steals the show
All my niggas know, when she hits the door
That girl has to go

Too hot, she's hot, melt, sex, too hot
Too hot, she's hot, gets all of that
Too hot, she's hot, that's a fact

Cars, clothes, girls and games, and
Through the years a lot of things changed
We shared the love like a melody,
My sweetest moments are when you're here with me
Give me all of me,
Giving you all of me, too
Trusting me, trusting you
In my life

EVERY MOMENT is so sweet
When you're laying next to me,
Our hearts beating as one
Nothing we can't overcome

Every time I look at you
Your smile lets me know you feel me too

Bobby
(No, no, no, no, no, no)

We don't see the same, and we don't speak the same
But if we don't get shit right this go 'round, then we ain't gon' beat the game
You can see the pain, we entertain when disagreements turn into blame
The heated words turn into flames under your skin, it just aggravates
Every nerve you got, and every working vein, gotta take a cool breath and respirate
We gon' get it right, no matter how many steps it takes
'Cause the devil gon' lie, and Heaven don't hesitate
And Lord knows we need Heaven, 'cause we're going through Hell each and every day
These emotions bottled up inside are hot enough to fry thermometers and lighters on my mind
A lot of us will find the answers obvious, but probably all the time
You gotta know the signs and loosen up how tight you hold your pride
Put emotions to the side and get a grip before you lose your mind

Nobody wins
When we fight, fuss and argue

Thought I could settle down, my friend
Hoping for something to let

Then you left me all alone
Called me on the telephone
Said you found someone and you found fast
Girl you found him fast

All of my dreams are shattered

Now that I lost you, girl

But when I see you lady, I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk, it really turns me on
Ooh, you really turn me on, come on, come on, come on

Here I am sittin' in this fly ass hotel over Miami
Just watching the birds fly over the ocean
I guess I'm kinda trippin'
'Cause I'm kinda high
And don't give a fuck
So I wanna come at you on the real, baby
And let you know how I feel
You know, for the last few days
I've been watching you, all by my lonely
With your little friends
I see how you make them laugh
I've been kinda envious of your friends
'Cause it's like, they're so close to you

And I can't find the right things to say to get close to you
This is the only time in my life that money doesn't matter
The only thing that matters if finding the perfect place for me and you
So if you got the time, I got the place
One, two, three seconds are gone
Coulda been gone
A long time ago
So baby don't be shy
Tell your girlfriend bye bye so we can roll
And we can get nasty on the way
My car's got tint, so they won't see your face
There's no need to -
Ohhh, what I wanna do to you is right, babe

Come in and shut the door, so I can lay my back down on floor
And girl you are so bold, come and take control
Ohhhh
Riding up and down, do you want my loving round and round suck on your toe
We can start to flow

Do you know if anybody knows I want to slide
Tonight baby I gotta taste your love
Tonight baby I gotta hit it oh so right sugar
Do you know if anybody knows I want to slide
Tonight baby I gotta taste your love

Yeahhh
Here I am sittin' in this fly ass hotel over Miami
Just watching the birds fly over the ocean
I guess I'm kinda trippin'
'Cause I'm kinda high
And don't give a fuck
So I wanna come at you on the real, baby
And let you know how I feel
You know, for the last few days
I've been watching you, all by my lonely
With your little friends
I see how you make them laugh
I've been kinda envious of your friends
'Cause it's like, they're so close to you

And I can't find the right things to say to get close to you
This is the only time in my life that money doesn't matter
The only thing that matters if finding the perfect place for me and you
So if you got the time, I got the place
One, two, three seconds are gone
Coulda been gone
A long time ago
So baby don't be shy
Tell your girlfriend bye bye so we can roll
And we can get nasty on the way
My car's got tint, so they won't see your face
There's no need to -
Ohhh, what I wanna do to you is right, babe

Just listen
First of all
I have to be honest with you baby
I lied
When I told you I never wanted to see you again
Can you please stay
Just for tonight
And maybe we can do something
Like make love
Watch the sunrise
Or listen to jojo, k-ci, sing us a verse
Slide closer baby
Ha, that devante baby
Oh you feel so sexy, so good
Sorry I left you
Left you cryin
But since you've been gone
I've been all alone
Cause all of my tears
You know they left me drownin
Please baby I'm beggin
For you to stay at home
...

Been watching you for a long time
You look so good, got my eyes on you

I've been watching you for so very long
Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really want to meet you but I'm kind of scared
'Cause you're the kind of lady with so much class

I get my thoughts together for the very next day
But when I see you lady, I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk, it really turns me on
Ooh, you really turn me on, come on, come on, come on

Come & talk to me, I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you? I really wanna know you
Come & talk to me, I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you? I really wanna know you
Oh, oh oh oh oh

(No, no, no, no, no, no)

We don't see the same, and we don't speak the same
But if we don't get shit right this go 'round, then we ain't gon' beat the game
You can see the pain, we entertain when disagreements turn into blame
The heated words turn into flames under your skin, it just aggravates
Every nerve you got, and every working vein, gotta take a cool breath and respirate
We gon' get it right, no matter how many steps it takes
'Cause the devil gon' lie, and Heaven don't hesitate
And Lord knows we need Heaven, 'cause we're going through Hell each and every day
These emotions bottled up inside are hot enough to fry thermometers and lighters on my mind
A lot of us will find the answers obvious, but probably all the time
You gotta know the signs and loosen up how tight you hold your pride
Put emotions to the side and get a grip before you lose your mind

Nobody wins
When we fight, fuss and argue
