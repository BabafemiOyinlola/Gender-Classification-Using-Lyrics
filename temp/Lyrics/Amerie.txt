Now we got all night long, all night long
(Curious like what you want?)

So give me your [?]
No regrets, just be here with me now

Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but

It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin
It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh

Hey, we don't know each other well
So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels a clicking towards your door

C'mon, I can feel it now

I said, hey, I know it's been a minute
Since it's been good, baby, I ain't lyin'
You know a lil' somethin' missin'
Let me give you a piece of my mind

Maybe I need a little attention
Maybe I need a little more time
Maybe I need a little affection
Baby, I need you to just tell me

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna give you what you never had
'Til you're always thinkin' of me

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I got what you need and you gon' see
Baby, I'm gonna make you love me

So just tell me you love me

I know I ain't the one to play
But I'ma tell you my love don't come cheap
You act like you don't want it
But I'll make you, I'ma make you see

It's Amerie, I took a little time out
Took a vacation but boys, I'm back
Pardon the interruption but we got a news flash
Someone in the buildin' said Amerie's back

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Some of them wonder what it take to be my lover
First you gotta be my drummer, don't move fast
You can pop tags on the Louis bags
But it won't get you under my covers

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me

Whatcha doin' to me?

I guess I'm gonna tell you, don't know if I should
I don't do it everyday, so baby, listen good
It's so hard to admit it but I just wanna get with it
You caught my interest, baby, now I'm so willin'

Little too aggressive but it's kinda fly
'Cause you got the swagger like no other guy
I don't know how you do it but there must be something to it
'Cause whatcha doin' to me I just can't shake it
Whatcha doin' to me?

In the back of my mind I know I'm wasting my time
You put it all on the line 'cause it's dangerous
No matter how hard I try about what I feel inside
I can't do anything to contain this

I keep looking at you 'cause I don't know what to do
About controlling myself but I like it
But I know the game that I'm playin'
[Incomprehensible] so dangerous

When I was younger girl
Nobody told me 'bout the facts of life
I was living in the clouds
I didn't think about what's wrong or right

So I didn't understand
That playing games is what some people do
I swore I didn't start my life
Until the day I fell in love with you

And you kept takin' me higher
Just to drop me off

Do you feel like a man?
'Cause you've got my heart in your hands
And you took me high as you can
Higher just to drop me off

Tell me did it make you feel good
Treatin' me the way that you would?
'Cause you took me high as you could
Higher just to drop me off

I can't lose

What's the reason that I'm here again it's crazy
I keep waiting but I'm foolish cause you'll never change
Wasted all my time and here I am still crying over you
Over you

Loving you was so hard
(But I keep Trying Baby)
I just end of with scars
(Cause I keep fighting Baby)
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose
I can't lose

But I'm asking you
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing I think about
Why are you the only one

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one

Is it a crime to want that old thing back?
Can it be wrong to miss the way you used to kiss me?
Back in the day, back to the way you used to love me

Now you've got me ready to break the law again
'Cause I made a vow to rock with you 'til the end
So, tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
'Cause I remember when you said

Right from the door, said "Can we talk?"
You had me caught, got to admit it, love
Let's cut straight to the point
You know with me is where you belong

Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart
So far from the start?
Let's cut straight to the point
Baby, you know with me is where you belong

Pretty brown eyes, you know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I keep holding on after all your rejection

And I don't wanna let go
But you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on

It's a bad situation and I'm tired of pretendin'

Half the time almost every night

It's a hard road I'm facin'
So maybe I should keep it movin'
'Cause I can only trust you, baby
Far as I can see what's in front of me

You keep tellin' me

Come closer, here to me
Together baby, we can go far

Let me blow your mind sky-high

So many things that we can try
If you're not scared to fly

I don't gotta be your only girl, I just wanna take you around the world
And your seat's guaranteed
Here we are just me and you and the door is closing soon
So relax and be free

And fly with me, just so you know now

And fly with me, this is a red eye flight

And fly with me, I know it's going down

Now it's just a memory and it's hard to think
Hard to think about it
'Bout the love I left behind, I can't help but think
What could I have done about it?

But deep inside I know
It's your fault that I'm not there
Once you put aside your pride
I know that you saw it so clearly

That you're nearly losing your mind, tryna rewind
Do what you did and didn't do, so I'm telling you
You should have did so much more to show you loved me

I'm wishing, I wish you would have gave me the flowers
(When I could smell them)
And I'm wishing, I wish you would have held me for hours
(When I was around)

Now there's nothing you can do
But to wish I was with you
But it's too little, too late, too late, too late
Press rewind to go back in time

So there's nothing you can do
'Cause I'm no longer missing you
You should have gave me the flowers
(When I could smell them)
'Cause now I'm gone

And baby, it's so hard to believe you
When you say that you promise you'll be better
'Cause everything you're saying right now
You were saying forever

You should have showed you loved me

It's like you tryna change things that make me, me
But I can't help but be, be who I be

We can be different people

It’s Miss. Amerie and Mr. A-Milli
Smelling like money, it’s probably Young Money

Crew neck tee, all black chuckers
Weezy F B, the girls them lover
And if it ain’t me then the girls just suffer
I got the big bread so the girls just butter
And you ain’t gotta love me cus the world do
And I ain’t gotta do me cus ya girl do
Miss. Amerie, took a lil time out
Bugatti sit so low you gotta climb out
Bring it back, bring it back
I blow your spine out
Haha, get the handicap sign out

I done heard them all talk bout how much they want me
But ain’t never had nobody put it on me
(Hey) keep doing what you doing cause it ain’t been done to me
Keep doing what you doing cause it ain’t been done to me

It's this 1 thing I want to admit it (you did)
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh

Hey, we don't know each other well
so why I keep pickin' up my cell?
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh
Hear voices I don't want to understand

So many things I'm goin' through
So much that I wanna do
It startin' to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed

So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
And fall in love, so many reasons why

Why don't we (So why don't we)
Why don't we, why don't we (Yeah)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (Why don't we fall in love)
(It's so many reasons)
(It's the only thing that matters to me)
Why don't we fall in love

He's lookin' like he can't believe this
Always in my jeans
And bet he don't know what I'm thinkin' (I wanna take him home with me)
This here's gonna be my weekend
I don't think he knows that I see him
His bodys got me weak (and I can't wait to see)

What it is I really want is for him to do to me what he wants to (oh)
He would want to, yeah (oh)

Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
'Cause when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day but
That never mattered too much to me, hey
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know I can do anything
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this

show me your love can be true (show me your love can be true)
anything you want me to do (anything you want i'll do it)
just make me believe in you (make me believe in you)

I can't deal with temptation
you know it leaves me with no inspiration
another man playing on me
may have a hard time succeeding you see (you don't seem to be)
you don't seem quite like the others

Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
'Cause when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day but
That never mattered too much to me, hey
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know I can do anything
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

And you can't get no lower

You're so sexy
Heaven help me please
I need to get my mind right
And it's so hard because
You're so incredible
Those lips of yours so luscious
I just wanna bite
And I could do that all night

(Sexy gloss, Matte or Frost)
Don't matter cause it's coming off
You're so sexy, I can't help myself
(Ruby Red, Pink Champagne)
Don't matter cause it ends the same
Never lasting when I get to you

Crazy crazy wonderful
Can you really feel it?
Uh oh oh
I wanna be your cherry kiss
You can put your lips like this
Crazy crazy wonderful
Can you really feel it?
Uh oh oh
I wanna kiss you all the time

Don't act like you're so surprised
Feel the silk against your skin
Let the games begin

Don't waste time come get me right now
Don't worry 'bout a thing it's 'bout to go down

you don't love me
and though you tried to hide
hide it from me
I know i can see the truth
so easy to love you in the beginning
and so easy to play the fool
cuz i was willing
but it's over now

when loving you was easy
when loving you was easy
tried to make it hard for me
still i stuck around
i was set on loving you
and no matter what you did
i stuck through it

when loving you was easy
why'd you make it harder
why'd you make it hard for me

wishing that you'd would come around
oh, you made it easy for me to leave you

it could have been so easy cuz

Lonely days and lonely nights are waiting for me
But I gotta leave
From the day rise up until the night falls down
I'm losin' myself, so I can't stay around

I'm still the girl that you met, you called me perfect
But now you're changin' I'm not good enough anymore
So I did it for us, I wanted to keep your love
You tried to mold me
And I thought that I would please you more

You want me to be what you want me to be
But you can't
Paint me over, you tried to paint me over
I tried my best to be your everything
But you can't
Paint me over, you tried to paint me over

You know what they say
That everything in your life
Brings you to where you are today
I know what they mean
'Cause even with all the bad
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause it lead me to you
And if one thing was different
I know you'd be missing
So there's no regrets
I can only thank god
For the day that we met

Somebody up there must love me
'Cause he gave me you and that's why
Somebody up there must love me
Yes I know in my heart and I'll try
To give you love
To give you everything you need
You don't even know how much you've given to me so
Somebody up there must love me
'Cause he gave me you

Now I would be lying if I said
That love wasn't trying

i know that you are standing by my side

Staring in the mirror as I
Start to carefully contemplate
Just really how deep is this thing I have for you
It's wearing on my heart
And from the start you know I tried, steadily denied
Friendship turn to love
I know you probably think that I'm so strange -
Stuttering on every word when you look my way, why?
And maybe it's all in my mind
But when we hugged goodbye I had butterflies
I just died (yeah yeah yeah)

I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life

Any other time, I could resist, now my will is gone
Getting weak, that ain't E-V-E, hell, is going on

Oh, been tryin' to let it go
Tryin' to keep my eyes closed
Tryin' to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak

Don't wanna tell you what it is
Oh, wee, it felt so serious
Got me thinkin' just too much
I wanna set it off but

It's this 1 thing that got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that got me trippin'
You did this 1 thing my soul may be feelin'
It's this 1 thing you did oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh

It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
You did this 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh

Hey, we don't know each other well

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
You’re all that I need
The simple things you do for me you keep comin’ through
I must say that I’m impressed
I know you love the whole world, seems I’m the only one you know
‘Cause you’re so personal
You got me sayin’ like oooohh, because you’re fillin’ my cup
Oooohhh, I just can’t get enough
So let it be known, wouldn’t trade your love for nothin’
You see, you’re all that I need

[Verse 1 – Flame]
Lord you're so holy, in a league of your own
You didn’t owe me but remember you took Francis Jones
You gave me everything when my grandmother died
The greatest gift of all, you when you opened my eyes
Lord my heart was broke seein’ her in there dead
In the hospital doctor pronouncing her dead
You took my best friend, at the time I was blind
Hard to look ahead, hard to put the past behind
But like Isaiah 6 when King Uzziah died
I saw you Lord, seated on the throne lifted high
I saw you Lord, in a way I never seen before

He's lookin' like he can't believe this
Always in my jeans
And bet he don't know what I'm thinkin' (I wanna take him home with me)
This here's gonna be my weekend
I don't think he knows that I see him
His bodys got me weak (and I can't wait to see)

(Hook)
What it is I really want is for him to do to me what he wants to (oh)
He would want to, yeah (oh)
He can come inside my mind
If he tried but he don't know how I want to (oh)
Baby, don't you know what you get from me

Our love what we once treasured
Your ways what I remember most of all
Can't quite get away
From the days we love so heavenly

Your kiss such a sweet surrender
That day when I let my temper
Get the best of what we used to have
Now I got to ask you can you make it

Like it used to be
Bring back your love to me
I remember when our love was new
And all I needed in my life was you
And baby it felt so right to me
Please make it like it used to be

Look, you don't have to take this
You can come with me

So hard to believe she left you alone all alone
I know babe, you can come with me though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone
I know babe, you can come with me though

I know you're alone, you can come with me though
I know you feel pain, you can come with me though
I know you feel hurt, you can come with me though
It wouldn't be the same, if you come with me though

I just couldn't believe, believe it babe
That she would go and treat you that way
Especially after all the craziness you took
It just ain't necessary

I can feel the tears that you cry at night
'Cause I know what love supposed to be like
Every little kiss and hug that she put aside
Baby if you want to I can make it right

So hard to believe, she left you alone all alone
I know babe, you can come with me though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone

Can't breathe, can't think
Been through enough
My friends on the streets stopped so abrupt
"What's wrong?" They demand "Tell us what's up?"
No need, one look and they all shut up
See it's written all over, anyone could see
No matter how my daily attitude seems
And I'm tired of missin' what I can replace
So I'm tired of the world knowin' your mistakes
And the tears keep rolling down my face
Rolling down my face
Rolling down my face

Tears keep rolling down my face
Rolling down my face (Ooh oh)
Tears keep rolling down my face
Rolling down my face
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling

(Ay) They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling rolling away

Please take this phone I don't wanna talk

And tell you how this thing had really started
When I come around
You act like loving you is under audit

So baby can you gimme just a little more time
'Cause I'm having problems trying to read your mind
I really don't know what do with you
What's so weird to you, now I'm through with you

Can we, can we go back
To where love is?
Can we, can we go
Can we go back to where love is?

I've given up on love
But I gave up on the chance
That I'd ever fall
Head over heels
And all the stars
I wished upon
I never thought
That one would fall
Down on me
Ooh, it's good to know

There's somebody
Somebody who feels like me
(Ooh, tt's good to know)
There's Somebody
Somebody who loves like me
(Yeah, I waited all my life)
For somebody
For somebody who can do
It like me
(And ooh, tt's good to know)
Found somebody
Found somebody
Who's just like me
(Somebody who's just like me)

Now here we are
And I wanna
Make the most of it
Wanna hold you
And get close to it
Baby, let me love you
Don't let go
And promise that you won't forget

Hey understand I'm not used to letting go
Once in my past, I told myself I'd never lose control
But you're not to blame, so please don't ever change
And forgive me if I, I hesitate

(Over and over and over again)
I'm scared to lose

For the way, I carry on

You's a grown' ass man
Dawg you can't even stand on ya own two feet
Now your lookin' my way
It's too late 'cuz you messed it up with me

You needa change your tone
Get your swagger goin'
You gotta hold your own
So don't call my phone
'Cuz you ain't gotta home with me no more

Get it out your head baby

Get ahold of yourself

Wishin we could read minds
Don't wanna let our feelings show

I'm willing to give as much time as I can

Every time our eyes meet
(Every time our eyes meet)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
 (Talkin' to me)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me

Just ain't no need for words to speak
'Cause every touch
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', to me

Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me

Your always actin' so composed and cool
Never got too many words for me

Cross my heart

And from the start you know I tried, steadily denied
Friendship turn to love
I know you probably think that I'm so strange -
Stuttering on every word when you look my way, why?
And maybe it's all in my mind
But when we hugged goodbye I had butterflies
I just died (yeah yeah yeah)

Don't want nobody to bring me back to life

So high I can't look below
When you say my name I lose control
And I start to float

And whenever I want this feeling to go
I touch the sky and realize
One look in your eyes
