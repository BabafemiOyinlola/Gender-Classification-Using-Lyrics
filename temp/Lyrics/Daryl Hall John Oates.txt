Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what's right for me
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But it's plain to see that they can't comfort me

Sorry Charlie for the imposition
I think I've got it, got the strength to carry on
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooh what will be

She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, what went wrong

Get up in the morning look in the mirror
I'm worn as her tooth brush hanging in the stand
...

You're A Rich Girl, And You've Gone Too Far
'Cause You Know It Don't Matter Anyway
You Can Rely On The Old Man's Money
You Can Rely On The Old Man's Money
I T's A Bitch Girl But It's Gone Too Far
'Cause You Know It Don't Matter Anyway
Say Money But It Won't Get You Too Far,
Get You Too Far
And Don't You Know, Don't You Know
That It's Wrong To Take What Is Given You
So Far Gone, On Your Own
You Can Get Along If You Try To Be Strong
But You'll Never Be Strong
'Cause
You're A Rich Girl, And You've Gone Too Far

There's a thunder storm 'a brewin'
And the day is turning gray
There ain't much to say about the weather
The shower stall is leakin'
And the ceiling's fallin' in
And I'm getting twenty bills to every letter

The sun beats down so slow
I feel my body heating up inside
I watch the danger zone
For signs of life but not a soul alive
Try every trick I know
To keep my temperature from blowing sky high
Check on the time to go
Lay my spirit down to fantasize
...
