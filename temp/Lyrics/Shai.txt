Your lips said "Hello"

But I was caught up
In physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Baby you were more than just a face

And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)

And your rainbow starts to appear
Let us take you far far away from here

Girl rest your eyes, I'll watch you
Don't worry none, I'll keep you safe
Keep you safe, safe, keep you safe
And every waking moment
I'll pray the sun adorns your face, your face

In the stormy days of life, I'll be the light, so hold on
To guide you through the night, just be patient
Can we spend our nights alone with thoughts of paradise only

Lady, I hope we can be together soon
Lately, I'm waking up every day at noon
And maybe, all the meaning is just a minute or two
With you, alone with you

And I know we said we wouldn't
Ever overcrowd each other
But now that we are lovers
I just want you here with me

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy

Pardon me, don't worry you're all I'm thinking of
Funny, how silly we get when we're in love
Money can never be worth a minute or two
With you, alone with you

Have you ever just wanted to love him
That you never had to answer to
No headaches, no heartaches no broken promises
Someone who could just get you on and leave
And not take your emotions with him
See uh, I'm that man
But I'm not real, I'm just a fantasy
Hrm, remember me
I was in your dream last night
But you don't know my name
All you know is I did it and it felt just right
So maybe that's our destiny
In this world that's so insane
We hit each other off by candlelight
I'm not even real
Just a figment of imagination
No, never cause an aggravation
No more jealousy, dishonesty
It's purely ecstasy, laying next to me

And nothing's gonna wake me now
Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling,
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough

And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
But now I'm falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling,
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

And I can feel the eyes, they're watching us so closely oh
I'm trying not to make a sound
Cause I'll be found out somehow

So keep calling,

Tonight is the night
Of love and sweet romance
May I have this dance
I could make you feel special(feel so special baby)
If you give me half the chance
I'll always respect you(always respect)
I'll never neglect you baby(i'll never neglect)
And I think Ill find you'll trust
So prepare yourself
(get your body ready)
For a night that can only be described as sensual
Tonight is gonna be

Sexual
Tonight is the night
That we make love all night and morning never comes
Sexual
The moon is so right for us to love
So right
Until one of us falls

Oh, everybody goes through changes, yes
Oh, changes baby

You know, lately I've been going through changes
And sometimes, you just gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Just make sure you're sure

I was in a situation, it was a little too much for me
To handle all the pressure that one can get
When you were too in love

I was always falling in and out and in and out of love
There were emotions so strong
And sometimes you just gotta let go, yeah

Many times before I felt all alone
I know life's unfair but girl I'm true to myself
Baby can't you see you've been hurting me?
Now, just let me walk out of the door

Everybody goes through changes
Sometimes you gotta let go
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
(1409618341378)
This is the place where you belong
Right here in my arms
Without you something is wrong

Misery, such a fool to let you walk away from me
Now it seems there's just nobody there for me
Girl I'm in agony, for you, oh

Gone without a trace
Never knew that love was such a lonely place
Damn I need your lovin' just to feel this space
I'm in so much pain without you, oh

You left me here alone
Why don't you come back home to me, oh
Everybody help me sing now

This is the place where you belong
Right here in my arms
Without you something is wrong

I got a call. A telephone call today.
Somebody's offering a job a thousand miles away,
And I want to take it, it's the opportunity of a life time,
But I need a second opinion, an opinion other than mine.

So I, I'm turning to you,
Because you always seem to know what to do.
When times like these arrive, I call,
On my only true friend in the world, my girl.

So I, I want to know,
Should I really, really go,

Lady, I hope we can be together soon
Lately, I'm waking up every day at noon
And maybe, all the meaning is just a minute or two
With you, alone with you

And I know we said we wouldn't
Ever overcrowd each other
But now that we are lovers
I just want you here with me

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy

Pardon me, don't worry you're all I'm thinking of
Funny, how silly we get when we're in love
Money can never be worth a minute or two
With you, alone with you
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
(1409618341378)
Have you ever just wanted to love him
That you never had to answer to
No headaches, no heartaches no broken promises
Someone who could just get you on and leave
And not take your emotions with him
See uh, I'm that man
But I'm not real, I'm just a fantasy
Hrm, remember me
I was in your dream last night
But you don't know my name
All you know is I did it and it felt just right
So maybe that's our destiny
In this world that's so insane
We hit each other off by candlelight
I'm not even real
Just a figment of imagination
No, never cause an aggravation
No more jealousy, dishonesty
It's purely ecstasy, laying next to me

...

Life, what does it mean?
Life, check it out

Tell me sometimes do you feel like
You're servin' no purpose in life
And you ask yourself all these questions why
And life still passes you by, tell me

Did you know, did you know
That what you do affects the stars above
And the earth and the moon and the sun
And did you know
That me and you represent peace and love
If you feel like we do

So if you feel like we do
Then vive with the music
Just let us enter your soul
And if you know like we know
Then you've got to use it
Just let it take control

Shai... coming right back at ya baby
Part 2
Remix... Ooooooh
If I ever fall in love again
The next time the lady will be
Just like you

[Verse 1:]
The very first time
That I saw your brown eyes
Your lips said "hello" and I said "hi"
I knew right then you were the one
But I was caught up
In physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Baby you were more than just a friend

[Chorus:]
And if I ever fall in love again

Talk to me, baby.
I'm listening.

Lay down.
And tell me what's on your mind.
What exactly did he do? To make you cry this time?
Well, I will be your comforter. I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart. And I will bring back your light
Come in...

I see he's hurt you again,
When you're in pain I'm in pain
That's part of bein' a friend.
But this is a special case.
I held my feelings back because of him
And now I can see more than ever
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
(1409618341378)
Understand girl that my heart is in your hands.
And I'm cautious. Of falling in love again.
So please don't hurt me, I'm scared.
Don't desert me, I'm afraid.
Of being a fool. Again.
So Baby I'm yours, if you want me. And if you want my sweet love.
And Baby I'm yours, if you need me. La la la.
Loving you forever, if you want me. Give me your love.
Baby I'm yours, if you need me. Ohh...
Realize girl that my faith is kind of torn.
Watch your step girl, Because my heart is weak and worn.
