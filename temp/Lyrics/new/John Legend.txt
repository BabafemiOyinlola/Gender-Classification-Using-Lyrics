Yo yo Yo yo Yo yo  She's a fast love professional Crafty, bold and beautiful Staged right, locked eyes I swear it's magical  Her name is Melanie Says she digs my melodies Likes how I move Thinks I'm cool That's what she says to me  Big stage, bright lights, short love long nights Frequent flights through the skies to see stars  I come back to town She's hangin' around It still feels so real but it can't go too far  Her favorite colours be platinum and gold She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo I should know 'cause I've seen it before I think I gotta let her go She only loves her stereo  Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I realized as I lay down to sleep We haven't spoke in weeks So many things that I'd like to know Come have a talk with me I need a sign, something I can see Why all the mystery? I try not to fall for make believe What is reality? Where do we go? What do we know? Life has to have a meaning Show me the light, show me the way Show that you're listening Show that you love me Show me that you walk with me  Hopefully just above me Heaven's watching over me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Ooooohhh...  Where do we go who knows But each day gets better I just can let her go (oooh, oh no) Each kiss gets sweeter I just can leave her noo  I'll write a song I thought about it for far to long But I Never had someone to sing about Until I met her and each days get better Nobody knows Nobody sees Nobody else understands me like she Now there I Know what true love means I Just hope she stays with me  Where do we go who knows But each day gets better I just can let her go ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Let's go to the park I wanna kiss you underneath the stars Maybe we'll go too far We just don't care We just don't care We just don't care.  You know I love it when you're loving me Sometimes it's better when it's publicly I'm not ashamed, I don't care who sees Us hugging & kissing our love exhibition, oh  We'll rendezvous out on the fire escape I'd like to set off an alarm today The love emergency don't make me wait Just follow I'll lead you I urgently need you  Let's go to the park I wanna kiss you underneath the stars Maybe we'll go too far We just don't care We just don't care We just don't ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Yeah, Yeah sing it with me y'all,  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Can we wait just a minute? Slow it down for a minute now, baby You're talkin' loud, you're wilding out Don't seem like my old lady Let's go and play the song we used to play Can we reignite the flame? 'Cause things just ain't the same  We can talk about the baby We can talk until we're crazy We can focus on it now Or we can focus on it later We can start another fight We can argue and fuss all night But I propose that we go  To floor and we slow dance Tonight I wanna dance ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Another Again"  So we did it again Knowing we should quit it, but we simply won't admit it again Oh it feels good, it's so good, but I won't do it again It's so dramatic again After we go at it, we get mad then we go at it again Oh I love it, then I hate it, she's my favorite again I'm wasting time I can't help it she's so fine Oh I like her style And I love the way she talks and I smile As much as we may try Can't quite see eye to eye So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye  (And again and again and again) Oh, and then, we do it again We do it again and we do it again ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused She may not be you But she looks just like you She may not be you But she looks just like you  You should've seen the way she wore her dress And her white stiletto shoes You should've seen the way they looked on her Just like the ones that I bought you I searched for days on end to no avail 'Til I found them in Peru She must've been to Lima just as well Because she had them too You should've seen her eyes, her lips, her face She looked as sweet as honeydew ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

A father waits upon a son A mother prays for his return I just called to see If you still have a place for me We know that like took us apart But you're still within my heart I go to sleep and feel your spirit next to me  I'll make it home again I pray you'll fall in love again Just say you'll entertain the possibility I learned enough from my mistakes Learned from all I didn't say Won't you wait for me  It may be long to get me there It feels like I've been everywhere But someday I'll be coming home ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Remember when, I caught your eye, You gave me rainbows, and butterflies, We did enjoy, a happiness, When our love was over, I was such a mess, I smiled at you, and you smiled back, That's when I knew, there's no turning back, You said you loved me, and I did too, Although it's over, I still love you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Here we are, under the stars Here we are, under the stars Heaven is not so far Heaven is not so far Heaven is not so far Under the stars  We'll find a love to hold our hand through the cold We'll find an angel light out in the storm We'll see a light to lead us all the way home And wherever we go we will know  Here we are, under the stars Here we are, under the stars Heaven is not so far ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
You bought your smile in a corner You paid a pretty little penny, you did.  You paint yourself in a picture As you deny the kind of person you've been You get what you feel, what you wish to be You can't live sarcastic sincerity You sharpen your guilt like a guillotine  You get what you feel, you get what you feel I gave you everything, you threw it away. Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette. Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
