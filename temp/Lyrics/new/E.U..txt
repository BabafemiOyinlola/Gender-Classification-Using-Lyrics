Ow, shake it! Yeah, oh, you're lookin' sweet, baby Yes, indeedy Funky (get down)  We was on a dance floor shakin' our thing To a funky beat with a go-go swing Everyone was watching, they stared in shock Amazed at how Salt and Pepa was rockin the place With a smile on my face Some got upset and then tried to base They called us nasty, said we danced dirty Claimed we were freaks, cheap, even flirty Pepa got pissed and pulled out a pump I was all set not to jet but to jump Spin broke it up and asked not to break Said, "They don't understand the way you..."  [Chorus:] Shake your thang, owww Do what you wanna do I can't tell you how to catch a groove It's your thang (It's your thing) Do what you wanna do I won't tell you who to sock it to  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Looking at myself, I see the man, nigga I'mma call it like I say it, I'mma call you bitch made nigga Holding pistols not to entertain niggas I got held up at the light reaching for my switchblade, nigga Popeye's on his spinach with the gauge, nigga If I tell you that the babysitter's dead, don't play, nigga Reach inside your pockets, dial H, nigga If you need help with pressure, don't drive this way, nigga You know I got schizophrenic tendencies I dream of porn stars and pouring gas on my enemies If I get a check, I'm not the vet I'm a dawg ass nigga looking for a hump bitch  Shaka Zulu with the new do with the TEC This is not a purchase, everyday life shit I've been praying for your downfall, man But all I see is bad bitches coming down the hill, damn Shaka Zulu noodle and the TEC Don't tell anybody that the babysitter's dead And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect  She bowed to her knees, want forgiveness But all I could think about was coming out of speakers She a fun girl living on the edge Poppa ran a hedge fund, all his daughter do is give head Said he had it up to head and neck Don't you point the thing at me, it could go off offside your head Temple to the brain, now he dead That's a life learned lesson, never stress over bullshit ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
