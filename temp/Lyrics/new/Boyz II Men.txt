Settling along the scenery, beneath the steady fall The dusk accompanies a loneliness, descending as snow Tears can drown the embers in this broken heart of mine Another portrait in my life watching the seasons passing by  Crystallizing every breath I take, even the subtle sighs The wind carries a solemn melody through uncovered trees At the red brick station the trains can catch their breath And I've been patient, waiting for someone who won't come back to me  Tonight the tears will go away, I'll find a way to play this Serenade How can I break this song away from my emotions The snow is falling down to kiss and help me reminisce and celebrate ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
