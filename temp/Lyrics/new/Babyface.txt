When can I breathe once again? And when can I see you? ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

So let's stop pretending.  So long Feel bad for all the pain I might have caused My fault ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Sometimes we wish for the better When we have it good as it gets Sometimes the grass isn't greener As soon as we find out, we forget Sometimes a fool he's doesn't know he's a fool Sometimes a dog, he don't know he's a dog Sometimes I do stupid things to you When I really don't mean it at all  Sometimes a man is gon' be a man Its not an excuse, its just how it is Sometimes a wrong, don't know that they wrong Sometimes the strong, ain't always so strong Sometimes a girl is gon' be a girl She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world God knows I don't mean to give it to you So girl, I'm sorry for the stupid things I wish I didn't do but I do  Oh Oh no Oh ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
