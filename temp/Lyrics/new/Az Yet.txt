Last night you were so into it You told me secrets that you've never told a soul You were so nervous and yet, oh, so comfortable As we explored your image of love I drank your wine as you taste mine I kissed your lips, you felt my mind slip Into your soul I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful Last night, I was inside of you Last night, while making love to you I saw the sun, the moon The mountains and the rivers  I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you Last night, there was no planning it It was so special and so very innocent We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies As we explored our visions of love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
