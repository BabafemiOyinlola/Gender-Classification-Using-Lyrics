Époque où le rap donne plus son opinion par peur d'pas rentrer en playlist Où le musulman en mal d'amis est vu comme extrémiste Où en plus d'être une marionnette faut être contorsionniste Où la question de trop fera de toi un complotiste Nouvelle saison, nouvelle pilule, nouveau comprimé Les pompiers pyromanes font croire que l'oppresseur et opprimé Le cul-de-jatte fait de sa langue une arme pour que son bruit court Donc parfois il vaut mieux une punchline qu'un long discours On nous propose le retour d'Sarko comme alternative 2017 second tour FN - UMP: affaire à suivre Un territoire où l'islamophobie est assumée En réponse à ça ta minute de silence n'est plus assurée Bientôt partir faire l'pèlerinage sera synonyme de Jihad Gueule du suspect depuis que l'équipe de France n'a plus d'Zidane On est tous surveiller par l'troisième œil de Ten Shin Han Fuck la presse bobo musicale c'est pas du rap de festival Inversion totale des valeurs, Marianne se voile la face C'est pas en faisant d'elle une Femen qu'elle évitera l'impasse Médias discrédités car le peuple a compris l'manège Suffit d'rester deux minutes sur BFM pour que le film s'abrège On te dira que le pays est à l'ombre d'un troisième Reich Que l'histoire ne fait qu'se répéter, qu'on veut pas écrire la même page A qui la faute aux Palestiniens où aux Ashkénazes? Suffit de lire la lettre écrite à Mazzini par Albert Pike On a sentit qu'en 2013 c'était pas la même marche Les beurs de Vaulx-en-Velin ont fait all in sans avoir l'carré d'as Même les associations antiracistes ont plus la cote Car elles ont l'idéologie d'Onfray et Finkielkraut Quand le deux poids, deux mesures est flagrant A-t'on le droit d'se poser des questions? Sans que l'Ordre établit crache sur toi des défections La démocratie est en réflexion A voir l'âge des gouvernants, il cache la vérité comme leurs problèmes d'érections On nous fait croire qu'le lobbyisme est un fantasme Tout les racismes doivent être combattus mais faut pas qu'ça devienne un chantage C'est la course à celui qui aura le plus souffert L'esclavage et les génocides en cours passent quasiment tous sous couvert Et c'est en vrai l'soucis donc j'crois qu'il faut creuser plus loin La crise économique, sociale en a plumé plus d'un Ceux qui ouvrent leurs gueules sont des fachos et ceux qui la ferment sont des putains Pendant qu'en hautes instances on partage le butin Pour qui dois-je prendre parti?
