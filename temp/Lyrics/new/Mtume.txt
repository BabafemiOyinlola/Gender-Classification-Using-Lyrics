Hey boy, I know it's what you wanted Closer to me Sweet thing, I know just how to flaunt it Can't you see  I'll Deliver C.O.D. I'll Dleiver C.O.D.  Let me Make it right Turn you  On all night Just call my name ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine away  The other night dear, as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken And I hung my head and cried  You are my sunshine, my only sunshine ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
