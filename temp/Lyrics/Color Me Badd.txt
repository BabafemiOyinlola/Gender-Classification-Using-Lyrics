When I was lost I could not see
All the beauty and wonder wrapping around me
I was alone dreaming of you
Oh, I could not imagine this dream coming true
So much joy now in all that I touch
You make me feel everything so much

I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh
I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh

Face in the wind, tears from my eyes
Baby, where have you been?
But I was always waiting for you to pull back the door
To take me by the hand and lead me through
This whole world was a stranger to me

She's faced the hardest times you could imagine.
And many times her eyes fought back the tears.
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders,
bore the weight of all her fears.
And the sorrow no one hears,
Still rings in midnight silence
In her ears...

Let her cry, for she's a lady (she's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child (child)
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

Where does love go when you're not in love?
How does it feel when nobody wants it?
Tell me does it float around like a little lost cloud
When a heart is not its home?

What does love do, when it's not being used?
Feeling like you just don't get enough home
Is it laying awake in the middle of the night
Thinking about what went wrong?

'Cause when I look in your eyes it's just not there
And when I hunger for affection, the cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hanging on
When loves got the message then its already gone

Why am I always the last to know?
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over?

Why am I always the last to see?

When we ooh... tonight,(tonight)
and we make-n it right just for love.
Hey girl, I love the way you do, the simple things you do.
The way that you go down on me.
and oh girl, you proved your style is smooth
with everything you do, with every little fantasy
Oh girl, I want to live them out with you
and we take our time with the special love affair. Yeah!
Coz' I've got this feeling inside of me, and I wanna' set it free. ooh baby.

When I was lost I could not see
All the beauty and wonder wrapping around me
I was alone dreaming of you
Oh, I could not imagine this dream coming true
So much joy now in all that I touch
You make me feel everything so much

I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh
I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh

Face in the wind, tears from my eyes
Baby, where have you been?
But I was always waiting for you to pull back the door
To take me by the hand and lead me through
This whole world was a stranger to me
...

Yeah, yeah, uh, oh baby, yeah

Where does love go when you're not in love?
How does it feel when nobody wants it?
Tell me does it float around like a little lost cloud
When a heart is not its home?

What does love do, when it's not being used?
Feeling like you just don't get enough home
Is it laying awake in the middle of the night
Thinking about what went wrong?

'Cause when I look in your eyes it's just not there
And when I hunger for affection, the cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hanging on
When loves got the message then its already gone

Why am I always the last to know?
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over?

Why am I always the last to see?

Many a night I lie alone
Inside a room that's not of my own
Having no one to hold onto
Who'd understand what I am going through?

So I at night, lay down a plan
To occupy myself to make me a better man
That's the only way I get through the night
So I don't turn off the lights

And I wait for all eternity
For someone who will comfort me
And as time passes, I get vivid flashes
Of you running through my mind, oh yeah

Many a morning sun appears
Wake up and find on my face a tear
'Cause from the vivid dream in my head

She's faced the hardest times you could imagine.
And many times her eyes fought back the tears.
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders,
bore the weight of all her fears.
And the sorrow no one hears,
Still rings in midnight silence
In her ears...

Let her cry, for she's a lady (she's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child (child)
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

Rosanna's little sister
Watched me as I kissed her
Older sister's lips
With a passion that always missed her
It was dark outside my window
But I could see her from the light
She was standing perfectly naked
Turning up the heat of the night
In the heat of the night

No matter how I try she's there
I just can't get her out of my mind
I can't hide

Hands, they're tickin' by me every day
Fallin' in love
While I feel your love is slippin' away

But if you should fall I'll be there to catch you
In 40 years I could never miss you
Baby I'll be there for you
But first you got to, got to let me know

How deep is your love? Are you willin' to go?
Ever an' every extra mile to show that you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love with you baby doll

You are my savior
Got me through my deepest darkness, girl

She's faced the hardest times you could imagine.
And many times her eyes fought back the tears.
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders,
bore the weight of all her fears.
And the sorrow no one hears,
Still rings in midnight silence
In her ears...

Let her cry, for she's a lady (she's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child (child)
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

You make me feel everything so much

I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh
I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh

How does it feel when nobody wants it?
Tell me does it float around like a little lost cloud
When a heart is not its home?

What does love do, when it's not being used?
Feeling like you just don't get enough home
Is it laying awake in the middle of the night
Thinking about what went wrong?

'Cause when I look in your eyes it's just not there
And when I hunger for affection, the cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hanging on
When loves got the message then its already gone

Why am I always the last to know?
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over?

Why am I always the last to see?

To occupy myself to make me a better man
That's the only way I get through the night
So I don't turn off the lights

And I wait for all eternity
For someone who will comfort me
And as time passes, I get vivid flashes
Of you running through my mind, oh yeah

Wake up and find on my face a tear

hum... ohh baby.aww baby Yeah!
We goin' take you back a little further
Thinkin' back on you and me,
Remembering how it use to be
Those times are precious, I cherish every moment we spent. Yeah!
Thinkin' back on all the arguments
Thinkin' back way back when
We kissed and made up and all was fair in love

So now we gotta go back baby (maybe we can turn the hands of time)
Going back to when (Going back to when you were mine)
When we were one (remembering the times when we were one, one in love)

Anything you want me to
I will live or die, you choose
This I swear

Only love, I will live
Only love, I will give
Only love, I will live
Only love, I will give

Only love can make me do
What I don't wanna do
Only love, I will live, only love

You know I? m not much on words
But I got to tell you how I feel
(Open your eyes, don? t try to hide my love)

So hard to say but I think it? s best
Gotta give your heart it's time to heal
(When you're ready, I? ll be there)

Sometimes I try and sometimes I cry
Only love make me do
What I don? t wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die, you choose

I? m serious when I tell you love
That a little heartbreak is ten to a dime
(Don? t be afraid, just turn the page my love)

Curious when the day will come
I see my reflection in your eyes
(Take your time and I? ll be there)

She's faced the hardest times you could imagine.
And many times her eyes fought back the tears.
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders,
bore the weight of all her fears.
And the sorrow no one hears,
Still rings in midnight silence
In her ears...

Let her cry, for she's a lady (she's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child (child)
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild
...

Girl, I? ve had some good, I? ve had some bad in my days
I never knew someone like you would come my way
To tell the truth, I can? t help but be a little afraid
I think your love might be a little too much for me

(Now we can get sexual)
Girl, I wanna be down everyday and night
(Now we can get sexual)
Just as long as you know my sexual capacity
(Now we can get sexual)
I? m dyin?, I? m tryin?, I wanna
I? m afraid that your lovin? might just be a little too much for me

Girl, I? ve paid the dues, I? ve made the rules all before
I? ve seen them beg, I made them plead for more
But I? ve never seen nothing better babe
I am a little afraid I think your love might be a little too much for me
And I gotta say

(Now we can get sexual)
Girl, I wanna be down everyday and night
(Now we can get sexual)
Just as long as you know my sexual capacity
(Now we can get sexual)
I? m dyin?, I? m tryin?, I wanna
 (I? m dyin?, I? m tryin?, oh)
I? m afraid that your lovin? might just be a little too much for me

When I was lost I could not see
All the beauty and wonder wrapping around me
I was alone dreaming of you
Oh, I could not imagine this dream coming true
So much joy now in all that I touch
You make me feel everything so much

I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh
I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh

Face in the wind, tears from my eyes
Baby, where have you been?
But I was always waiting for you to pull back the door
To take me by the hand and lead me through
This whole world was a stranger to me
...

Yeah, yeah, uh, oh baby, yeah

Where does love go when you're not in love?
How does it feel when nobody wants it?
Tell me does it float around like a little lost cloud
When a heart is not its home?

What does love do, when it's not being used?
Feeling like you just don't get enough home
Is it laying awake in the middle of the night
Thinking about what went wrong?

'Cause when I look in your eyes it's just not there
And when I hunger for affection, the cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hanging on
When loves got the message then its already gone

Why am I always the last to know?
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over?

Why am I always the last to see?

Ah, ah, ah, ah, lovely
Oh, you make my world go round
Pick me up when I’m down
This much you mean to me
(Ah, ah, ah)

The way you understand
The way you hold my hand
In times of loving me
(Lovely)

Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Ooh, I got that feeling inside
When I get you on my mind
(Ya, ya, ooh, ya)

Sweet lovely, lovely, lovely
Ya, that deep down feeling inside
I’m begging you to be mine

Say, gotta have you for myself

I have a plan, a woman and a man
against the wind but living free
the price for love my life for thee
don't run in fear, I need you to be here
I will climb the walls you hide behind
I will search the world until I find
I know that the ride we take
a life we'll make above the fears, beyond the tears
