Drink up baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be
That you'll never see
The promises you'll only make

Drink up with me now
And forget all about
The pressure of days
Do what I say
And I'll make you okay
And drive them away

Give me a HO if you've got your funky bus fare... HO HO HO

There's a double dutch bus comin' down the street
Movin pretty fast
So kinda shuffle your feet
Get on the bus and pay your fare
And tell the driver that you're
Goin' to a Double Dutch Affair
Fe Fi Fo Fum
Well I'll be darn here it comes
The Double Dutch Bus is on the street
You'd better get off the curb
Move your feet

Bus fare trans-pass
That's the way my money lasts
Ain't got no car to get around
When I go to work I've gotta go downtown
Now I've missed my train
That's a darn shame
When I'm running late no sleep's to blame
If you've gotta wife you know I'm right
Gotta special man well I can understand
Uptown, downtown everybody's getting down
Say uptown say downtown
Well I've missed my bus I know I'm late
I've gotta do something I know I hate
I'm gonna walk to work fifteen blocks
I already got a hole in my socks
Go ahead and laugh that's okay
Cause what I really wanna say
I got bad feet my corns hurt
To top it off I'm lost for work
Let me tell you what I say
When I'm dealing with the funky sidewalk

Peace to the gods
Peace to the earth
And peace the woman
Who hold themselves with the worth
Girl you're on my mind
But i need you to decide
Am I Mr. Wrong or Mr. Right
Do you want me in your life?
It's driving me crazy
To think you might not be my lady
But that would change see
You could be the one that changes me cause
Girl you're amazing and you never fail to amaze me
And I wait patiently as I wait for you til infinity
So let me show you the world
All imma tell you that you are my girl
Cause I I
And i got nothing no nothing to hide
And I just want you in my life
Say it, Woah
Maybe i've been a fool but i'm inlove with you
For you girl i'll be true
Do whatever you want me to do
Can't help how I feel
Let's dance under the moon
You leave me wanting more
Just darling tell me what's the score?
Darling tell me what's the score
