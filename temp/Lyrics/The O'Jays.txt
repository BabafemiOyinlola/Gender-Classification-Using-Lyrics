Hey, wine me and dine me
Take me in a way I wanna go
But when the night is over
You just may not see me no more

All I want is a one night affair
That won't hurt nobody
A night affair

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, but it could be fun

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't want us get anything
I just may not be ready
To fly down with a wedding ring

All I want is a one night affair, you're right
A one night affair and that's started one

Hit and run

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman

Few days ago we were inseparable
Love so good just want more
Man how things turned I can't get to this
What a 360, what a two years

Never fussin' never no arguments
I was so happy, something I missed
Irreconcilable differences
We're not compatible,
I ask why nobody knows

Why don't we make up
We didn't have to break up
In the first place
No, no

Was it because I work like this
The overtime, the dinners I missed
The things you wanted I had to get
...

My my my my my
My my my baby
My my my my darling
Yeah
My darling, it's been a long time
But we're still together
So when we make love
I always try to do something clever
Don't want you to ever get tired
Of this same old good thing
I wanna keep it alive
So nobody else can come take you away
‘Cause you're mine
And love is our Mrs
Open mind, open arms, and open heart
I'm here for your pleasure
So let's create a little bit of your fantasy
Enjoy getting you excited
Giving you the right thing

If you don't like doing that same old
Same old every day (Everyday)
You've got to use a little imagination, baby
(Use your imagination baby)
Wanna keep the love you've got
Don't let it slip away
(Don't let it slip away)
You've got to use a little imagination, baby
(Use a little imagination, baby)
Romantic journey, can we explore, love?
We can create our own vibe
Make each day special
So many ideas go in between us
Keeping the magic alive
Whatever you desire
Baby, let's make love
I'll make up a move, do it to you
You do it to me back
Oh it feels so good pleasing you
You keep me inspired

這輩子在妳身邊 是上天給的機會
我不會就這樣忘記妳是誰
有妳存在的雨天 走過的傷心大街
都將鎖在我青春的寶盒裡面

如果我將會化成蝴蝶
希望妳就是那朵玫瑰
這輩子因為妳的出現才會完美
如果我將是一滴雨水
就讓我假裝是妳的淚

I said they're ready for a change, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't know you
Got to give the people, give it up
Give the people what they want?
Well, well

No, don't know? You don't know, no
Got to give the people

Well, it's about time for things to get better
We want the truth, the truth and no more lies
We want freedom, justice and equality
I want it for you and I want it for me

You, you, don't you?

Stumbled to the floor, she was right in the door, I could see her face

We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you, no
There ain’t nothin’ wrong with me, uh uh

А болит у того, кто не пьет ничего.
Ой, бутылочка вина - ах, не болит голова,
А болит у того, кто не пьет ничего.

Так лучше веселиться, чем работать,
Так лучше водку пить, чем воевать.

The bright sun in the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You tell me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun
We walk the beach at midnight
And watch the stars in the clear skies
We both say I love you
But it's alright

Hello um
It's nice to see you here,
I was ... wondering if um ...
I can give you my number maybe
Oh your here for the summer
Oh that's nice,
maybe we can hang out sometime
I will give my number alright,
we can hang out
This will be, this will be fun
Alright, goodbye

The bright sun and the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You tell me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun
We walk the beach at midnight
And watch the stars in the clear skies

She's an extraordinary girl
in an ordinary world
and she cant seem to get away
He lacks the courage in his mind
like a child left behind
like a pet left in the rain
She's all alone again
wiping the tears from her eyes
some days he feels like dying
she gets so sick of crying

Ехали цыгане - не догонишь,
Пели они песни - не поймешь,
Была у них гитара - не настроишь,
И, в общем, ничего не разберешь.

Бутылка вина - не болит голова,
А болит у того, кто не пьет ничего.
Ой, бутылочка вина - ах, не болит голова,

You know, me and my woman
We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you, no
There ain’t nothin’ wrong with me, uh uh

We’re not the only people in the world

You know, me and my woman
We've been goin' through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It's been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain't nothin' without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin' at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin'

I said, "Baby, we can't go on this way"
She said, "You're right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain't nothin' wrong with you, no
There ain't nothin' wrong with me, uh uh

We're not the only people in the world

Hey, wine me and dine me
Take me in a way I wanna go
But when the night is over
You just may not see me no more

All I want is a one night affair
That won't hurt nobody
A night affair

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, but it could be fun

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't want us get anything
I just may not be ready
To fly down with a wedding ring

All I want is a one night affair, you're right
A one night affair and that's started one

Hit and run

You know, me and my woman
We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you, no
There ain’t nothin’ wrong with me, uh uh

We’re not the only people in the world

Played a few bars of a melody, and it sounded sweet to me
I thought I'd get up and take a look around, but my feet got in the way
Stumbled to the floor, she was right in the door, I could see her face

But how could it be, she ran away from me
My best friend's gone, I'm so all alone

When are you coming back home?

Are you coming home to stay?

Sittin' by the open fireplace in my favorite dungarees
Played a few bars of a melody, and it sounded sweet to me
I thought I'd get up and take a look around, but my feet got in the way
Stumbled to the floor, she was right in the door, I could see her face

But how could it be, she ran away from me
My best friend's gone, I'm so all alone

I kinda miss you Brandy, I'm so all alone
When are you coming back home?
I really miss you Brandy, missing you everyday
Are you coming home to stay?
'Cause I love you Brandy, oh yeah yeah yeah

People will rob their own brother

For the love of money
People can't even walk the streets
Because they'll never know who in the world they're gonna beat
For that mean, oh mean, mean green

Almighty Dollar!

Cash Money

For the love of money
People will lie, rob, they will cheat

For the love of money
People don't care who they hurt or beat

For the love of money
A woman will sell her precious body

For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight
Oh, that mean, mean, mean, mean, mean green

Almighty Dollar!

Talkin' bout, talkin' bout - cash

Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up rev me up
My little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not
Here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', bubblin' overweight lover hurt prone
So what's it gonna be
Me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
(Now) So why don't you just stretch
Stretch for a sec
Played? so I could cop a quick rec
Shake me, Shake me
Baby baby bake me
No need to fake here I am
Come on and take me
Wind your body
Baby move your body
I see you slip sliding
Come on now do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling Hunky Dory
'bout this thing that I found
(Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it)
(Now that we found love what are we gonna do
with it) [come on Heavy, come on Heavy]
(Now) I dig the way you wiggle
You don't jiggle
Once you jiggle
So hand over your love
Cause it's heavier
Than it'll
Move her like a mover
she wanted to groove so I grooved her
then she wanted to learn so we did school
and I schooled her

You're my darlin', darlin', baby
You're my darlin', darlin', love
You're my darlin', darlin', baby
I said, you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as I may live
Uh, you're my darlin', darlin', baby
You're my sweet and tender love
You're a very special lady
I said, you're the one that I always dreamed of in a woman
I'll give all that I can give
I'll give you plenty of love
Because you deserve the best
You should everything, a queen sittin' on a throne should have
You deserve to have it all
And I'm gonna do my best
To give it to you, to give it to you, to give it to you
Uh, you're my darlin', darlin', baby
You're my sweet and tender love
You're a very special lady

Played a few bars of a melody, and it sounded sweet to me
I thought I'd get up and take a look around, but my feet got in the way
Stumbled to the floor, she was right in the door, I could see her face

But how could it be, she ran away from me
My best friend's gone, I'm so all alone

Unity, we must have unity
Cause united we stand
Divided we fall

They played a game
Of divide and conquer
Ever since the word began
Tried their best too
Separable the people so
We couldn't understand
Come together and
Show our force
Now's the time for all
The people to speak with one voice
I'm talkin' bout

Unity, we must have unity
Cause united we stand
Divided we fall

Since we had a chance to get together
Nobody knows the next time we see each other
Maybe years and years from now
Family reunion (Got to have)

And her warm and tender embrace

In pieces, pieces and pieces before
Baby and you swore to never, never
Never love another man, another man anymore

People can't even walk the streets
Because they'll never know who in the world they're gonna beat
For that mean, oh mean, mean green

Almighty Dollar!

Cash Money

For the love of money
People will lie, rob, they will cheat

For the love of money
People don't care who they hurt or beat

For the love of money
A woman will sell her precious body

For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight
Oh, that mean, mean, mean, mean, mean green

Almighty Dollar!

Talkin' bout, talkin' bout - cash

Stumbled to the floor, she was right in the door, I could see her face

You know, me and my woman
We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry

Remind me of where I once begun
Come baby, show me, show me you know me
Tell me you're the one

I could be learning, you could be yearning
To see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours

Come baby, rock me, come baby

Lovin' you is such a pleasure
Especially when you're holdin' me like this, baby
The love we share can't measure
Each and every day just gets better
'Cause I found out that you were all that's missin'
In my life and it's you that made me realize
There's someone who can do it right
Love me, baby, both day and night
No one can do what you do
'Cause you do it right, oh oh
Keep on lovin' me, baby
Keep on lovin' me right
Keep on lovin' me, baby
All through the night
Keep on lovin' me, baby

Played a few bars of a melody, and it sounded sweet to me
I thought I'd get up and take a look around, but my feet got in the way
Stumbled to the floor, she was right in the door, I could see her face

But how could it be, she ran away from me
My best friend's gone, I'm so all alone

We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you, no
There ain’t nothin’ wrong with me, uh uh

We’re not the only people in the world

You know this thing is killin' me

You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry

For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight
Oh, that mean, mean, mean, mean, mean green

Played a few bars of a melody, and it sounded sweet to me

Stumbled to the floor, she was right in the door, I could see her face

But how could it be, she ran away from me
My best friend's gone, I'm so all alone

We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, "Baby, we can’t go on this way"
She said, "You’re right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you, no
There ain’t nothin’ wrong with me, uh uh

I just can't understand for the life of me
What I see in you
Yet every time you talk of leavin' me
I get so shook up, I don't know what to do

Oh, oh, baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
And I, oh I, oh I'm caught like a fish
And, baby, I just can't break free
You know this thing is killin' me

I must like it or, or I wouldn't be here, baby
Every time I get behind your back
I tell my friends I'm leavin' you
And when you question me about it, baby
I swear what they're sayin' just ain't true, no, no

Oh, oh, oh, baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
And I, oh, oh, I'm caught like a fish, ya
And, baby, I just can't break free

You and me, we can make it last
You and me must forget the past
You and me, we can build
A brand new life together, oh

I know your heart has been broken
In pieces, pieces and pieces before
Baby and you swore to never, never
Never love another man, another man anymore

Baby, don't blame me for the things that he did
That he did to make you feel this way
Can you find it in your heart
Baby, please, baby, please, oh, put your trust in me

It may seem hard sometimes
But we can make it through
I'm counting on you

Oh, where did I go wrong?
Girl, when you went away
You took a part of me
And you told me not to wait
You said, you want to be free
But I thought we'd be together
Never thought that I'd be alone
I use to think you would never
You'd never leave our happy home
I thought that we were fine
And everything was cool
But maybe I was blind
Maybe I was being the fool
'Cause I didn't see this comin'
Didn't know that you would walk away
So I'm searching for the answers
And maybe you can just tell me
Where did I go wrong?
And how can I make it right?

It's so nice to see
All the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout
All the things that's been goin' down
It's been a long, long time
Since we had a chance to get together
Nobody knows the next time we see each other
Maybe years and years from now
Family reunion (Got to have)
A family reunion
Family reunion
(It's so nice to come together) To come together
(To get together)
I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace
And if grandpa was here
I know he'd be smiling for me a tear
To see what he has done
All the offsprings from his daughters and sons
A family reunion (Gonna have)
A family reunion (Ooh, ooh)
Family reunion
(It's so nice to come together) To come together

Hey! (Jajaja)

(Chencho)
Mi vecinita le gusta los jangueitos
cada rato que la veo anda con su cervecita
ya no le gusta quedarse en su casita tranquilita
porque es media liberal la chamaquita
su coleccion de Cds es desde playero
pero en su carro siempre anda con lo nuevo
y si le pones reggaeton, se pone fresca
y hasta abajo, a lo under, ella le da sin miedo
(le da sin miedo)

La nena no se compara, lleva una vida de suerte
mirala como ella baila
mientras ella canta, se mueve

Eh Ah, Eh Ah
Eh Ah, Eh Ah (Maldy)
Se le ve, que se le salen por los poros
cuando escucha pista y coro
y las bocinas retumbando a la vez
ella se pasa en los foros
bajando reggaeton al I-Pod,

To get myself a cold, cold beer
'Cause when I come back to the house

when we learn to care for those lost in poverty
there would be no need for our daughters and our sons
to march up and down the streets singing we shall overcome

when the worlds at peace will it still be in one piece
I pray for the day when the bombs and the bullets cease
come lets make a change, or leave the world in dust
lets be the world of love for the ones that follow us
