Like you seen em twirl then he drop, nigga
And We Keep them 9 milli's on my block, nigga
And Monte Keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger he be wilding, he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with them Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Running through these checks 'til I pass out
Your shorty gave me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a hoe, get up out my trap house

They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch
You know me right that I'd beat a bitch, I'm a leader, bitch
I ain't even with the screaming shit, I'm a freezer, bitch
The next month where my sneakers ripped with the Beamer whip
Shooting niggas in front of Keisha crib right where Keisha live
Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib
CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this

Oh, They want that hot shit
All these social networks and these computers
Got these niggas walking round like they some shooters
See them in real life they trying to bust maneuvers
Like pussy talk that same shit from your computer

Just picked the cash up, they had the boy medula
Call up my broski Gene, like call up the jeweler
I just spent some cash on a pinky ring
Just made some brand new shmoney, what the fuck you think?
And bitch I'm heading to your city
Just to clap up all them?
Me and JJ went from 50
Filled up the gas tank it was empty
We heading out to Philly
Smoking Fronto, bitch no Phillies
I got racks all in my Billies
Shout out to Slice, that's my Billy
For Kokane, Shyste I'm getting trippy
Right to the other side with my guys and get busy
I'm shooting up the streets not the gym
I'm shooting at these suckers, not the rim
2Pac, Above The Rim
Put two shots in his chin
Ran down, he jumped the fence
I ran down in my Timbs
Saw the pussy through the tints
I was in that boy Memph Benz
With some shit that extend

Look around bitch, it's shyste time
But shyste ain't dead, he just went to Vegas
With his .45 and a couple Haitians
Bitch you ain't ‘bout that life, so why you keep on faking
Don't make King County have another patient
All them Zo's I bought with me, bitch them niggas Haitians
No green card don't call immigration

No conversation with these bitches, see these bitches later
