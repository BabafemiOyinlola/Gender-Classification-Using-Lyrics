Baby I am here
Do you know I am right here,
baby?
I really want to spend quite
time together
I'll turn off the phone and pull
the shades
We won't be disturbed tonight
Waited all day long to spend
sometime
Just my man and I
If we just leave the world
outside
We can fall in love once again
tonight
Lovers need to share the quiet
time
I know we still need the quiet
time
We can celebrate this special
time
And we don't need company
вЂЁWe'll just set the mood
with conversation

All the things

Cross the bridges

Yes, I would

Do You Wanna Get Serious


When I left you tonight
Well you looked so good
Baby
There was moonlight
In your hair
And God only knows
How I hated to leave you
Just standing there
I could've held you
Forever and ever
But the moment wasn't right
So I let go and took off
For another lonely night
Now I'd like

Ooh, hoo, yeah
Mmm, hmm

Tired of living life

Like a rainbow in the sky
Crying to be seen

When I open my eyes
to find inspiration
I search for the best I can see
If I settle for less
I won t be the best I can be

It's cost me a lot but there’s one thing that I've got
It’s my man, it’s my man
Cold and wet, tired, you bet
All of this I’ll soon forget with my man

He’s not much on looks, ain't no hero out of books
But I love him, yes, I, I love him
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me but I love him

I don’t know why I should
He isn't true, he makes me blue
What can I do?

Ooh
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Lookin' back
Over my years
I guessed
I've shedded some tears
Told myself time
And time again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight
Things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'd better let it go
(What you think about it, girl)
Let it go, baby (Oh, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

Tried to take control
Of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts
Sense of time
And have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps
And the bruises
Of all the things
Of a two-time loser
Tryin' to hold on
Faith is gone
It's just
Another sad song

I think
I'd better let it go

Painting pictures on the window pane
Feelings my heart cannot explain
Oh, the silence, sounds like music
Seems like I can hear a melody

I only want to be with you, tonight
And if you want me to, baby ask me to stay

Some that I understand, and some I guess

Are you right for me?
Do you ever dream?
Do you even know, ha, tomorrow's another

Will we be in the same place, in the same
way?
Don't wanna leave, but it seems that I just
can't breathe
Maybe we need a change
'Cause we always complain about the same
things
If we agree to change
Will it be for good or will we be back here
again?
I can't wait that time, please tell me now
I just wanna be in love again, oh
(Can we just, can we just be in love again)
If we kiss away the pain (If we kiss away the

Can it be new again?

But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
Thats all you got to do

But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah

Sat down to write you a letter
Promised I'd write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That I don't even know what to say

I don't know where to start
Don't know how to begin

When our love was beginning
It was so right and so true
Now here I am and it's ending
Trying to find out just was for you

I don't know where to start it
Don't know how to begin
And I don't even pray anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, oh my tears
So many tears, so many tears
(So many tears)

So long, it's been so loveless
There's jealousy, played its part
Then you begin, but I don't understand
Trying purposely to break my heart

Dream In Color

Ooh, hoo, yeah
Mmm, hmm

Tired of living life
in black and white
There s so much in between
Like a rainbow in the sky
Crying to be seen

When I open my eyes
to find inspiration
I search for the best I can see
If I settle for less
I won t be the best I can be

Show me the way now
Moving step by step to love
Show me, yeah, the way now
Touching where I've never been touched

Everybody's looking for a reason
Making time and calling it love
But you give me all I've ever needed
Don't ever stop filling me up

(Show me)
Yeah the way now
Moving step by step to love
Oh baby, won't you

 (Show me)
Show me the way now
Touching where I've never been touched

I've been used and I've been good at using
Running from the pain deep inside
But you make me feel the joy of living

Lookin' back
Over my years
I guessed
I've shedded some tears
Told myself time
And time again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight
Things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'd better let it go
(What you think about it, girl)
Let it go, baby (Oh, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

Tried to take control
Of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts
Sense of time
And have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps
And the bruises
Of all the things
Of a two-time loser
Tryin' to hold on
Faith is gone
It's just
Another sad song

I think
I'd better let it go
(What you say about it?)

It's cost me a lot but there’s one thing that I've got
It’s my man, it’s my man
Cold and wet, tired, you bet
All of this I’ll soon forget with my man

He’s not much on looks, ain't no hero out of books
But I love him, yes, I, I love him
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me but I love him

I don’t know why I should
He isn't true, he makes me blue
What can I do?

Painting pictures on the window pane
Feelings my heart cannot explain
Oh, the silence, sounds like music
Seems like I can hear a melody

And if you want me to, baby ask me to stay

Constantly

How to make you love me
Whoa
Sure
As there's a moon above
It's a friend of mine
It still makes you burn

Said, ooh, ooh
Something tells me
The fires
Goin' right up
Your spine
Whoa, ooh
Somethin' tells me

Ooh yeah

Everyday we used to slip away to talk
We would talk about the goodness of your heart
Now it seems I admit that never exist at all
And it leaves me feeling empty with this hollow call

Make it like it was
The way it used to be
When I hungered for your love
Constantly

Make it like it was
It was easier for me
I know you're able
To make it like it was

At a certain time you would find me on my knees
Asking you to supply my brother's needs
Now it seems the needs are a secondary thing
And it truly makes me wonder

It's the way that you hold me
And the way that you kiss me tenderly
I could never, never be lonely
You give me just what I need

Hey, good lovin' baby
Good love, good love

A special lover is so hard to find
I never thought that I'd be satisfied
Then you came and stepped into my life
It seemed so unreal, the way you make me feel

It's the way that you hold me
And the way that you kiss me tenderly
I could never feel lonely
You give me just what I need

(Good lovin')
Always what you give to me
(Good lovin')
Your love's got a hold on me
(Good lovin')
Hey hey, and I know we'll love forever
Together we'll be

No more loneliness, the fear is gone
Your good lovin' keeps me strong
I feel so safe when I'm in your arms
And being here with you is where I belong

Me loving you
Was so easy to do
Now since you left me
I’m trying to make it through
Every song I hear
Everywhere I turn
There’s a moment
I had shared with you

All the pain
I thought it would never go away
Oh but now the rain has stopped pouring down
I see a new day coming round

It doesn’t hurt anymore
Knowing I live my life without you
Every day I grow stronger
Cause I don’t need you any longer
And now I’m ready to face a brand new world
It doesn’t hurt me

Safe in your arms
Talking all night long
...

I've seen your face before
Somewhere, somehow, I know
Of that I'm sure
You turned and smiled at me
And started something I
Never thought would be

I wish that you and I
Could meet again, someday
I've never felt this way
For anyone else
No baby

This is love, this is love
Oh I think I'm falling for you
This is love only love
No one makes me feel like you do
No one but you

I believe all over the world, one love
I believe all over the world, one love
I believe all over the world, one love
Let it be, let it be
I believe in one love

We're on a carousel of great design
And all we have to do is treat it kind
All creation is for us to learn
To be together as one

How we get there is no mystery
The power lives inside of you and me
It's the miracle we're looking for
Let us upon the door

Dream In Color

Ooh, hoo, yeah
Mmm, hmm

Tired of living life
in black and white
There s so much in between
Like a rainbow in the sky
Crying to be seen

When I open my eyes
to find inspiration
I search for the best I can see
If I settle for less
I won t be the best I can be

Lookin' back
Over my years
I guessed
I've shedded some tears
Told myself time
And time again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight
Things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'd better let it go
(What you think about it, girl)
Let it go, baby (Oh, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

Tried to take control
Of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts
Sense of time
And have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps
And the bruises
Of all the things
Of a two-time loser
Tryin' to hold on
Faith is gone
It's just
Another sad song

I think
I'd better let it go
(What you say about it?)

It's cost me a lot but there’s one thing that I've got
It’s my man, it’s my man
Cold and wet, tired, you bet
All of this I’ll soon forget with my man

He’s not much on looks, ain't no hero out of books
But I love him, yes, I, I love him
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me but I love him

I don’t know why I should
He isn't true, he makes me blue
What can I do?

(feat. Peabo Bryson)

I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place i never knew
But, now, from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now i'm in

Everybody's looking for a reason
Making time and calling it love

Don't ever stop filling me up

Moving step by step to love
Oh baby, won't you

Sat down to write you a letter
Promised I'd write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That I don't even know what to say

I don't know where to start
Don't know how to begin

When our love was beginning
It was so right and so true
Now here I am and it's ending
Trying to find out just was for you

I don't know where to start it
Don't know how to begin
And I don't even pray anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, oh my tears
So many tears, so many tears
(So many tears)

So long, it's been so loveless
There's jealousy, played its part
Then you begin, but I don't understand
Trying purposely to break my heart

oooooooooooooo

I will endure, all the time.
Hold together in the worst conditions.
For at birth, we knew it to be, one of a kind.
mmhmmmmmm
And as it grew into this love of a legend,
we both made sure this piece of heaven
would withstand any test,
for the strength was made of love, faith and trust.

And until all the glitter's gone,
We'll be adding on to make it even stronger.
True love will never die,
Long after the love has lost it's shine.

Baby I am here
Do you know I am right here,
baby?
I really want to spend quite
time together
I'll turn off the phone and pull
the shades
We won't be disturbed tonight
Waited all day long to spend
sometime
Just my man and I
If we just leave the world
outside
We can fall in love once again
tonight
Lovers need to share the quiet
time
I know we still need the quiet
time
We can celebrate this special
time
And we don't need company
вЂЁWe'll just set the mood
with conversation

Gave you the love you never knew, girl, oh

I've cried so many times and that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry

Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I

Didn't I, this time?

Was it in my mind?
Sometimes I can't be sure of what I see in him
Sometimes I lose my way, I get down and pray, and ask
Him for his strength
I hope he understands
Sometimes I can't go on, living gets so tough

And I become so weak I can't even speak, then I need his

But, the thing that's so sad is sometimes we forget
