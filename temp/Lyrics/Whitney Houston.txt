I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do

So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy, living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue

There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above
Oh I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me is it really love
How will I know?
(Girl trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know?
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
So I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
...

I Will Always Love You

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go
But I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you
Will always love you

You, my darling, you
Bittersweet memories

Whatever you want, whatever you need,

Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally.

I'm every woman, it's all in me.
I can read your thoughts right now,
Every one from A to Z, whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa

I can cast a spell, of secrets you can tell,
Mix a special brew, put fire inside of you.
Anytime you feel danger or fear,

Someone for me
Someone for me

I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along
I wish that I could find a way
And party to the break of day
And there I'd be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me

Then mama comes and asks me
Why I am dreaming sitting alone
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever find
Someone for me
While I am young and seventeen

Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to find someone, someone
Someone for me

So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me

Never too much

Baby you give good love

Never stoppin' I was always searchin'
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses

Spinning through the town

Sooner or later, the fever ends

Hey, hey, hey
Sing it for me y'all!
See I was born in Newark (sure was)
Drive from Orchard Park now
We were always hand in hand
He wore high top shoes and shirt tails
Nip wore her pigtails
I knew I loved him even then
You know some disapproved it
They even boohooed it
But I told them time and time and time again
You know I was made to love him
Build my world around him
Hey, hey, hey
He's been my inspiration, showed appreciation
For the love I gave him through the years

I saw the news this morning
And saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine
But as I turned the page
And looked inside
There you were again (there you were)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
I can't stop thinkin' bout you
I hopped into a taxi
In a moment I was home
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
On the day that you left me
You said you had no regrets
There's a bond between us
That hasn't been broken yet
And the feelings between us
Will never disappear
How can you be far away
When your spirit's here

You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever

And the seasons of our love
Will always change I know
Maybe that's the reason
You felt we had to go
But soon you'll be missing me

Hey baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you

Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the morning comes
Feels good to me, my lovin' me

From the moment I saw you
I went outta my mind
Though I never believed in
Love at first sight
But you got a magic boy
That I just can't explain
Well you gotta, you gotta way
That you makin' me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you baby
I'll be down for you baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move so baby baby decide

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given my ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal
You're my first time
I feel like an angel
Who just started to fly
Well you gotta, you gotta way that
You makin' me feel I can, feel I can
Do anything for you baby
I will fly for you baby
Hold on and enjoy the ride
I'm not in no hurry

We can fly all night baby
It's your move now baby

(um, hmm, hmm.) (yea-yeah)
How could I throw away a miracle
How could I face another day
It's all of my doing I made a choice
And today I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand
The way I feel
How could you relate to so much pain
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today I pray
That someone should listen

For nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store

A pure and simple honesty

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the mornin' sun appears
We'll find our way together

I believe you when you say that you love me
Know that I won't take you for granted
Tonight the magic has begun

Friday night you and your boys went out to eat, uh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three, yes you did
If six of y'all went out, uh
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah, uh

I'll pack your bags so you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings and then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me
You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your caller I.D., oh

I've been through all this before
Don't think about it, don't think about it

When I think of home
I think of a place where there's
Love overflowing;
I wish I was home,
I wish I was back there,
With the things I've been knowing.
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning,
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall
Have a meaning.
Sprinkling the scene, makes it all clean.
Maybe there; s a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction;
It sure would be nice to be back home,

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm mm
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love, ooo

How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me

I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now, uh huh

Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown

I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away

I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed at least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me

Clock strikes upon the hour,
And the sun begins to fade.
Still enough time to figure out,
How to chase my blues away.

I've done alright up till now.
It's the light of day that shows me how.
And when the night falls...
The loneliness calls.

Oh I wanna dance with somebody,
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody,
With somebody who loves me.
Oh I wanna dance with somebody,
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody,
With somebody who loves me.

I've been in love,
And lost my senses,
Spinning through the town.

And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me
All at once

All at once
I started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now

We can take the night into tomorrow

Touching you I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine

You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned

Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh...

You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess

Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you needs a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind

And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day

Oh I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
...

There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above

Ooh, I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me is it really love

How will I know?
(Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?

How will I know?
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy
(Can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

I believe the children are our future,
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believed.
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
...

Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give the best of me

But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown

I broke my heart
For every gain

To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me

O say can you see by the dawn's early light

And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there

Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday, I'm coming back and it won't take long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms

When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day ...
lovely day, lovely day, lovely day ...
... lovely day, lovely day, lovely day ...

As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?

And each time I feel like this inside,
There's one thing I wanna know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?

I see you turnin' the world in your hands
Just let it go
I've loved you better, than ever you wanted
Doesn't it show

You've been standin' at the window, day & night
Lookin' at the rain
A simple conversation
A helpless situation
Please let me explain

Trust In Me, when you're all alone
Trust In Me, when you can't go on
If lovin' me is what you need
Trust In Me

I lost my heart
A long time ago
You made me feel
Like no one had before
Boy, you made me love you
Then you walked out the door
See I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours

And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up
And you gotta feel something, I know
I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
'Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back

Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad, oh, it hurts so bad, babe

My life's been better since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said, "I would do, boy"
I found someone who loves me for me, yeah yeah

Haven't had much drama since the day that we split, boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
I thought I was over you

Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

Won't they always love you?

But all I got from you
Was lots and lots of talking
Lonely nights filled with misery

Hey baby

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you

Day will make the way for night

And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun

Feels good to me, my lovin' me

You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list

But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue

And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me

I started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now

And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Spinning through the town

Sooner or later, the fever ends

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you needs a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your worlds falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well, you can't sleep 'cause your problems are to deep

Oh I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much

Just had to clear my mind again

If you want to feel the thrill of my touch
You better come out of your cave
It's so perplexing
Why you fight it won't you try it

Nothing can change it

Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before

If you believe that true love is only made in bed

It's time for you to strike back, they're lookin' at you
Whitney Houston, Muhammad 2 G
They're watching your every move
They're watching you

Why you lookin' at me?
Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

I feel your eyes on me, you've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me

See I don't understand, why you keep peepin' me?
When you don't even like me
You're after me and my man, don't think you're stressin' me
'Cause your lies don't excite me, no no

Never thought, never thought, never thought
Never knew, never knew that you would do this to me
Try to ruin me, be my enemy

Never thought, never thought, never thought
That you, would act as if you're cool with me
So why you lookin' at me, why you lookin' at me?

Don't get mad at me, 'cause I'm still gonna be
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat
Tell me, tell me, tell me, whatchulookinat

I'm reaching for my dreams and you're so quick to say what I can't do
You criticize my actions but I don't see you standing in my shoes
I'm going the wrong way, I'm doing the wrong things
Every word just gives me fuel
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

And tell me no, and I'll show you I can
And tell me no and I'll dig my feet right in
Tell me no, just tell me that I can' t win
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong, go on and go, tell me no

Now every step I take, you're right there trying to block my next move

Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I gotta do somethin' special for me

See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talkin' about, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruisin' in your car
An' you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

Such a pleasure loving you

Carries me from day to day
I appreciate the things you do
Ooh but there's one thing
I have to tell you boy
I dig your actions
But I love the things you say

I listen to the things you say
Things you say
Ooh you're calling me oh oh

To me baby
In a poem or a card
Serenade my heart

I listen to the things you say
Ooh you're calling me oh oh

Some girls just wanna spend guys' money
Live their lives chasing the milk and honey
Silver lines their every fantasy
But you're lucky 'cause that ain't me, no

Most girls think guys are all the same
Not true, so I can't take the blame
I love you through the joy and pain
Even the coldest Georgia rain

See, my love is like an open sky, open sky
See, my heart is like the river wide, river wide
No, my well would never, ever run dry
It runs over for you and I, you and I

See, my love is deeper than the sea
It's sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you got me
Trust in my love, my L-O-V-E
(My love, my love, my)

Some think that love is just a word, just a word
Because of all the things they've heard, things they've heard
They think they gotta close their hearts
Can't see the light, they so in the dark

But I know I got a real good man

Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
After working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a little treat say it might be little bit sweet

But he's worth it
He deserves it
He may not be perfect
He's all the man I need

He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling
And whenever we're together
I know I'm where I belong

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl
You used to know
So long ago

I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes
Which way to go
And I should know

I put myself aside
To do it in your way
But now I need
To do it all alone

And I am not afraid
To try it on my own
I don't care
If I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what
I'll keep it real, you know
Time for me to do it on my own

It's over now

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
If I changed my mind
If I changed my faith
Every time a stop light signaled
Each time I made mistakes

I don't think that I would be where I am today
I live my life without regrets
What you see is, what you see is
What you see is what you get and I'm

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed, unashamed

Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams

So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song

You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my day
and fill my nights with song

O holy night.
The stars are brightly shining.
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth. (Oh yes it is now.)

The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks

You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree.

Sometimes I wanna call you

Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do

Tanssittaa tyttöä laiturilla
Siellä missä kaislat kumartaa

Mies hieroo kylmää ilmaa ja sylkee suudelmaa

Ruma mies ei ketään rakasta

It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be

Maybe it's intuition
But somethings you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy, but I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only a sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for, I think I've found my way home

And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

I found out what I've been missin'
Always on the run
I've been lookin' for someone

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me, Baby
So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
(You give good love to me)
Never too much
(Never too much, will never be)
Baby you give good love

Never stoppin' I was always searchin'
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

You give good love to me, Baby
So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me

You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy, living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

Ooh, how will I know? (don't trust your feelings)

How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat

I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity...

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Remember when we held on in the rain

We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings

The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got, he's all I got in this world

He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go

I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day...
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing I learned
Is that I need you desperately...
So here I am
And can you please tell me... oh

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here, it's not the same
It's not the same

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got, he's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go
...

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

Now Romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothin' on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)

I believe in roses, but only from the heart
And if it's not sincere, baby then I don't want no part
I believe in one love, baby, true monogamy
What I don't know can't hurt me, well, that's not the way I see

If you believed in me you won't mess around
It's not like I don't know you've been with every girl in town
You got a lot of nerve to think I just close my eyes
While you walk around so full of it I give you my surprise

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore

I believe that angels watch everything we do
And all the wrong you're doing just might come back on you
I believe in phone calls when you're not by my side
Especially when it's lonely in the middle of the night

If you believe that true love is only made in bed
Lord, have mercy on you, chivalry is dead

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages
With ten thousand people watching
Well we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby can't you see through me
We're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love withholding nothing

Who do you love
I got a feeling you're the boy for me
I bet your love can set me free
I feel a love thing coming on
It started weak then got oh so strong

Strong enough to rock the world
Straight up I want to be your girl
So I keep praying to the stars above
That it's me who you're gonna love

Am I the one
Is she the one
Who do you love

Who do you love
I wanna know
Could it be me
Won't you tell me so

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity...

After you
Sometimes I tell myself I'm leavin'

I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say, “Love wins again”

So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me

You make me sick

Got me lit like a candlestick

Baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it

You got me goin' again
Baby, you got me goin' again
You were doin' me sick

He was doin' 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double 0, bumpin' Isley
He was gettin' kinda close, kinda touch-ay
'Cuz he had a little too much Hennessey

He told me that he wanna go home
With me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, "Boo, I don't really know though"

He got closer to me, it started gettin' deep
He had me in a zone
When he started to show me things
I never saw before

Baby, it was smooth but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a-cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
Got me lit like a candlestick
I get too hot when you touch the tip

He was a six foot stallion said a storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket with that rock in his ear
He made my heart stop palpitating every time he came near

He has a spankin' new range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin', he was plaided, and his head was cornrows
He has his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

'Cause I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

I start to activate my pad and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, roll my tounge 'cross my lips

For the first time since you've been gone, baby...
No friends to understand, to lend a helping hand,
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy...
But you went away, baby, and it's such a shame;
How could you turn your back on me? Oh...

Love overflowing;

Suddenly the snowflakes that fall
Have a meaning.

For me to go back
Now that I have some direction;
It sure would be nice to be back home,

When someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
(What'd you do? Oh baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(Made me cry)
What'd you do to me, can't take what you did to me

Now I see what you've been doin' wrong, blamed me all along
And made a fool of me baby, you got it all wrong
To think that I wouldn't find out that you were
Cheating on me, dear, how could you do it to me?
Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby face to face

And this is what I have to say

Clap your hands, all so right

And I'm standing on the front line
And the lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Cap your hands, all so right)
If I wake up in World War III
(World War, in World War III)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)

And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love

Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we knew we could, yes

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear

Hey baby

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

Now tell me how you feel
If I told you that I have feelings for you, baby?
And would it be so wrong to say what's on my mind?
I'm sorry I have to, baby baby

We were friends but with time
What I feel deep inside for you has changed
But I'd give up on love, if I thought
That it was untrue for you

If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that

Could get it back, could get it back
Check it out, come on

Remember when it all began
We were all in love
Then came the friends
Telling you when
Your time for me was good enough
I constantly had to compete
With your crew and their schemes
Remembering back in the day
I used to mean everything

(If we could just get it back)
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change with you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back

Now tell me why so many nights
You had so much to do
When you said bye
Sometimes I tried
I tried to make you choose
Now tell me how you can allow
Your boys to control
The time we shared
It was unfair
But now you need to know

See I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours

And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up
And you gotta feel something, I know
I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
'Till you come back to me baby

If there's a time when the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows to the sun on the other side
Don't despair, because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith, love won't let you lose your way, because

You, you'll never stand alone, I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold, I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home in these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone, love is standing by, oh yes, it is, yes

If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And you're cold and tired and lonely and this world has you in the dark

You know some disapproved it

You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do

But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity...

And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me
All at once

All at once
I started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now

Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine

You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned

Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh...

But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here, it's not the same

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got, he's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Hoo, how will I know? [(Don't trust your feelings)]
How will I know?
How will I know? [(Love can be deceiving)]
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy [(Can't speak)]
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me! I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uhh
Said there's no mistaking

Teach them well and let them lead the way

Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believed.
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me

Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown

I broke my heart
For every gain

To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me

O holy night.
The stars are brightly shining.
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth. (Oh yes it is now.)

In sin and error pining

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks

You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree.

You said you'd be here by 9
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit, trying not to cry
Askin' myself why, you do this to me

Since you're not around for me
To tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry

Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe...

Mmm, yeah

When we exhale, yeah, yeah, say
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop be doop

Why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying when I don't love you

So, why does it hurt so bad?
I thought I had let you go
So, why does it hurt me so?
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad, oh, it hurts so bad, babe

My life's been better since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said, "I would do, boy"
I found someone who loves me for me, yeah yeah

Haven't had much drama since the day that we split, boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying when I don't love you

So, why does it hurt so bad?
Baby, I thought, I had let you go
So, why does it hurt me so?

Hurts me so bad

Thank you for being woman enough to come

Whitney, what is this about?

I know he's leaving me for you

Who said that? Who told you that its true?

What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?

He told me that he loved me

I heard that

He told me I was beautiful

How did you know? How did you know?

'Cause I've played that scene before...

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

But how can I take advice from you?

Could I look into your eyes
Could I have this night to share this night together
Could I hold you close beside me

Should have seen it all along

All those sweet, sweet kisses and those sweet red roses
They convinced me that it was you
I made you exclusive
Now it's so conclusive
That you wasn't doing it too

If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around it would have been fine
It would have been fine
Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything is right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone
What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your world's falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear and
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day

A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be

Day will make the way for night

And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the morning comes
Feels good to me, my lovin' me

And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known

Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity...

Where do I go when there's nobody else to turn to?
Who do I talk to when nobody wants to listen?
Who do I lean on when there's no foundation stable?

I go to the rock
I know He's able
I go to the rock

The Lord is the rock I go to the rock for my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain, he stands by me

When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock

Where do I go, where do I go
When the storms of life are threatening?
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrows blow?
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation?

We all want to make a place in this world
We all want our voices to be heard
Everyone wants a chance to be someone
We all have dreams we need to dream
Sweeter than any star you can reach
Is when you reach and find you found someone
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing
The greatest gift this life can bring
Is when you look back and know
You were loved

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody

I'm trying to do things right
But I'm about to lose this fight
'Cause spending time with you
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth

And every day with you
I swear it brings me closer
to my only reservationis you
My sweet temptation, baby.

Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you

At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me

Hold me in your arms tonight

One Wish (For Christmas)
Whitney Houston
One Wish:  The Holiday Album

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
If there were no presents
Waiting on Santa's sleigh
What would I wish
For Christmas
And if Frosty, the Snowman
Were melting away
I would pray for hope and unity
On Christmas day
If I had one wish for Christmas

O holy night.
The stars are brightly shining.
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth. (Oh yes it is now.)
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks

I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do.
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas.
You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree.

And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

But somethin' tells me it's heading for heartbreak...
So darling please I'm praying that
This time yeah this time will be different
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize...

Tell me are you really ready for love boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love boy
Or is it the lonely talking again

When we got together
You promised you'd be forever true to me
But all I got from you
Was lots and lots of talking
Lonely nights filled with misery

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you needs a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your worlds falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well, you can't sleep 'cause your problems are to deep

The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Oh these lonely times

Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again

You're as cold as the London fog
You claim you want my love

If you want to feel the thrill of my touch
You better come out of your cave
It's so perplexing
Why you fight it won't you try it

Nothing can change it
We still belong together

Day will make the way for night

And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun

Feels good to me, my lovin' me

We said we needed space

And the only things I've learned

Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well
Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before

Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue

I believe the children are our future,
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believed.
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me

Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything is right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone
What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your world's falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear and
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm

When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Hoo, how will I know? [(Don't trust your feelings)]
How will I know?
How will I know? [(Love can be deceiving)]
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy [(Can't speak)]
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me! I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uhh
Said there's no mistaking

I finally took a moment
And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me
All at once

All at once
I started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now

Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine

I've had something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned

Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh...

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here, it's not the same
It's not the same

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got, he's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go

Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?

Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm

Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow

I can do, I can do anything for you baby
I'll be down for you baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move so baby baby decide

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given my ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal
You're my first time
I feel like an angel

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own baby
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

Oh I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much

Oh I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

There's a boy I know

Looks into my eyes

Tell me is it really love

How will I know?
(Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?

How will I know?
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy
(Can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

I believe the children are our future,
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believed.
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me

Each day I live

To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me

Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there

So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me

Never too much

Baby you give good love

Never stoppin' I was always searchin'
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here like you've been before

A few stolen moments, is all that we shared
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?

And I know that you still care for me

More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got, he's all I got in this world

He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you needs a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your worlds falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day

It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well, you can't sleep 'cause your problems are to deep

Merry Christmas!

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

This year, to save me from tears

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

"Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why you do this to me, oh baby
Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me

I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry

What'd you do to me, can't take what you did to me

Now I see what you've been doin' wrong, blamed me all along
And made a fool of me baby, you got it all wrong

And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you

Wishing you'd come back to me

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it

But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love for ever

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity...

A pure and simple honesty

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you needs a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your worlds falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well, you can't sleep 'cause your problems are to deep

The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
...

I don't know why I like it
I just do

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own baby
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

Oh I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much

Oh I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I saw the news this morning
And saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine
But as I turned the page
And looked inside
There you were again (there you were)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
I can't stop thinkin' bout you
I hopped into a taxi
In a moment I was home

Contact Contact

You've been avoiding me
Like a cat trying to dodge a dog
I never see ya shine
You're as cold as the London fog
You claim you want my love
Well I wouldn't know by the way you behave
If you want to feel the thrill of my touch
You better come out of your cave
It's so perplexing
Why you fight it won't you try it
Love's electric
Turn me on and see

Love is a contact sport
You gotta move in time
If you wanna do it right
Here I am
Love is a contact sport
You gotta act untamed
If you wanna play the game

On the day that you left me
You said you had no regrets
There's a bond between us
That hasn't been broken yet
And the feelings between us
Will never disappear
How can you be far away
When your spirit's here

You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever

And the seasons of our love
Will always change I know
Maybe that's the reason
You felt we had to go
But soon you'll be missing me

Hey baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you

Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the morning comes
Feels good to me, my lovin' me

Ooh...
I know it's been sometime
I've had something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned

Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh...

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well
Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before

From the moment I saw you
I went outta my mind
Though I never believed in

But you got a magic boy
That I just can't explain
Well you gotta, you gotta way
That you makin' me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you baby
I'll be down for you baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move so baby baby decide

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given my ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal
You're my first time
I feel like an angel
Who just started to fly
Well you gotta, you gotta way that
You makin' me feel I can, feel I can
Do anything for you baby
I will fly for you baby
Hold on and enjoy the ride
I'm not in no hurry

We can fly all night baby
It's your move now baby

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

Now Romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothin' on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here, it's not the same
It's not the same

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got, he's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go

I hope you realize, baby

Hey, you where I run for cover
Your loving shelter for me

And when I find myself needing some lifting up
One night with you and that always is enough
Hey, you make being in love a true rare affair
So take me, I'm your prisoner

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover for life

I wanna be you lover for life
Your lover for life

I just want to hear you say
You'll be my lover, my lover for life

I believe in roses, but only from the heart
And if it's not sincere, baby then I don't want no part
I believe in one love, baby, true monogamy
What I don't know can't hurt me, well, that's not the way I see

If you believed in me you won't mess around
It's not like I don't know you've been with every girl in town
You got a lot of nerve to think I just close my eyes
While you walk around so full of it I give you my surprise

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore

I believe that angels watch everything we do
And all the wrong you're doing just might come back on you
I believe in phone calls when you're not by my side
Especially when it's lonely in the middle of the night

If you believe that true love is only made in bed
Lord, have mercy on you, chivalry is dead

(um, hmm, hmm.) (yea-yeah)
How could I throw away a miracle
How could I face another day
It's all of my doing I made a choice
And today I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand
The way I feel
How could you relate to so much pain
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today I pray
That someone should listen

For nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store

All of my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss

'Cause I've been to the bottom, now I'm back on top
When I'm feelin' the rhythm as we start to rock

But what I'm feeling is summer in my heart

Is it too familiar to say "I love you"
Would you be suspicious if I asked your name
Tell me, what would it take
to really convince you

Could you turn this man

Here it is, another day, so dark and gloomy
My situation's real sadness goin' through me
Because my love is not here for my kiss

All I have is thoughts of yesterdays bliss
Images of you stay on my mind
Anticipating and waiting for the clock to unwind

Anxiety plays me as dusk turns to dawn
But I could take the wait, it won't be long
As confidence grows, I start to ready myself
Prepare myself for what lies ahead

As I dread the every minute I have to face without you here
Close but so far as the time draws near
How much more can I take, how much more, what can I do?
Just hold on tight and be strong

I know I'll make it through
Nows the time for the needs to finally go away
I feel you near, and it's a lovely day

Then I look at you
And the worlds all right with me
Just one look at you

And I know it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

But you came home around three, yes you did
If six of y'all went out, ah
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay

Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah, uh

I'll pack your bags, so you can leave town for a week
Yes I am

So why did 213,

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believed.
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me

When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time

Aah
Yeah

Woo!
Hey yeah
Haa
Ooh yeah

ah-ha
Yeah
I wanna dance

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love
Hoo How will I know (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (love can be deceiving)
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I don't know why I like it
I just do

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own baby
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

Oh I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much

Oh I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

(Whitney:) Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know theres much to fear

We were moving mountains long before we knew we could
Whoa, yes
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
(Mariah:) whoa...
(Whitney:) Hmmm yeah

(Mariah:) In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain

Ooh...

I know it's been sometime
I've had something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day

We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned
Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh...
...

From the moment I saw you
I went outta my mind
Though I never believed in
Love at first sight
But you got a magic boy
That I just can't explain
Well you gotta, you gotta way
That you makin' me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you baby
I'll be down for you baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move so baby baby decide

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given my ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal
You're my first time
I feel like an angel
Who just started to fly
Well you gotta, you gotta way that
You makin' me feel I can, feel I can
Do anything for you baby
I will fly for you baby
Hold on and enjoy the ride
I'm not in no hurry

We can fly all night baby
It's your move now baby

Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine

Oooh-ooh-ooh

I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
A girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)

Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right

Take me for what I am

Take my love

Just all that you are
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow

I won't hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

Now Romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothin' on me
So show some respect for the love you receive

Heaven hear me now
Im lost without a cause
After giving it my all

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you

Yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song

I look to you

After losing my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything is right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone
What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your world's falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear and
Love will save the day

Love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow

Can't run from myself

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare

A girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you (oooh)

Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)

But now I need to do it all alone

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll gonna keep it real
You know

I can see it's hurting you
I can feel your pain
It's hard to see the sunshine through the rain
I know sometimes it seems as if
It's never gonna end
But you'll get through it

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here, it's not the same

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got, he's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go

Ooh...

I've had something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned

Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh...

Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song

We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long

Before we knew we could, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe

Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve

When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear

So, why does it hurt me so?
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad, oh, it hurts so bad, babe

My life's been better since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said, "I would do, boy"
I found someone who loves me for me, yeah yeah

Haven't had much drama since the day that we split, boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying when I don't love you

Baby, I thought, I had let you go

You were loved

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody

Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine

Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown

I broke my heart
For every gain

To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me

I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do.

I'll be home for Christmas.
You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree.

It's the second time around
For you and I boy
And believe me it's confusing me
I'm afraid to say let's make up and All's forgiven
But somethin' tells me it's heading for heartbreak...
So darling please I'm praying that
This time yeah this time will be different
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize...

Tell me are you really ready for love boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love boy
Or is it the lonely talking again

Now the time before
When we got together
You promised you'd be forever true to me
But all I got from you
Was lots and lots of talking
Lonely nights filled with misery

A long time ago
You made me feel
Like no one had before
Boy, you made me love you
Then you walked out the door
See I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours

And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up
And you gotta feel something, I know
I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
'Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back

All at once
I finally took a moment
And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me
All at once

All at once
I started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now

...

(um, hmm, hmm.) (yea-yeah)
How could I throw away a miracle
How could I face another day
It's all of my doing I made a choice
And today I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand
The way I feel
How could you relate to so much pain
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today I pray
That someone should listen

For nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store

And saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine
But as I turned the page
And looked inside
There you were again (there you were)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
I can't stop thinkin' bout you
I hopped into a taxi
In a moment I was home

One night with you and that always is enough
Hey, you make being in love a true rare affair
So take me, I'm your prisoner

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover for life

And I gotta do somethin' special for me

Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talkin' about, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

When you're cruisin' in your car
An' you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

Live their lives chasing the milk and honey
Silver lines their every fantasy
But you're lucky 'cause that ain't me, no

Most girls think guys are all the same
Not true, so I can't take the blame
I love you through the joy and pain
Even the coldest Georgia rain

See, my love is like an open sky, open sky
See, my heart is like the river wide, river wide
No, my well would never, ever run dry
It runs over for you and I, you and I

See, my love is deeper than the sea
It's sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you got me
Trust in my love, my L-O-V-E
(My love, my love, my)

Some think that love is just a word, just a word
Because of all the things they've heard, things they've heard
They think they gotta close their hearts
Can't see the light, they so in the dark

But I know I got a real good man

But he's worth it
He deserves it
He may not be perfect
He's all the man I need

He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling
And whenever we're together
I know I'm where I belong

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I lived as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
to make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Yeah
Don't make no difference if I'm wrong or I'm right
I've got the feeling & I'm willing tonight
Well I ain't nobody's angel
What can I say?
Well I'm just that way
Hey, ey
I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
to make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Just say it, say it, say it
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Yeah

I've been around this world
I've been a lot of places
Seen a million faces
In a thousand towns
But when I looked into your eyes
I knew I found Heaven
And I've been wantin' to tell you
I never wanna let you go

It may be winter and heat on
But what I'm feeling is summer in my heart

Is it too familiar to say "I love you"
Would you be suspicious if I asked your name
Tell me, what would it take
to really convince you
that I'm gonna love you
even if my heart would break

I see a better day
I can feel it coming
I can hear it calling
in the winter night
Could you turn this man
into a true believer

Someday, I'm coming back and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday, I'm coming back and it won't be long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms

What did I do, my darling, that made you send me running
Told you to cast me down and throw me out?
What can I tell you, honey, if I don't know what I've done?
All I can hope is that you ask me to come back home

Someday, I'm coming back and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday, I'm coming back and it won't take long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms

Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

Here it is, another day, so dark and gloomy
My situation's real sadness goin' through me
Because my love is not here for my kiss

All I have is thoughts of yesterdays bliss
Images of you stay on my mind
Anticipating and waiting for the clock to unwind

Anxiety plays me as dusk turns to dawn
But I could take the wait, it won't be long
As confidence grows, I start to ready myself
Prepare myself for what lies ahead

As I dread the every minute I have to face without you here
Close but so far as the time draws near
How much more can I take, how much more, what can I do?
Just hold on tight and be strong

I know I'll make it through
Nows the time for the needs to finally go away
I feel you near, and it's a lovely day

Then I look at you
And the worlds all right with me
Just one look at you

And I know it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?

And each time I feel like this inside,
There's one thing I wanna know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?

I see you turnin' the world in your hands
Just let it go
I've loved you better, than ever you wanted
Doesn't it show

You've been standin' at the window, day & night
Lookin' at the rain
A simple conversation
A helpless situation
Please let me explain

Trust In Me, when you're all alone
Trust In Me, when you can't go on
If lovin' me is what you need
Trust In Me

Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
After working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a little treat say it might be little bit sweet

But he's worth it
He deserves it
He may not be perfect
He's all the man I need

He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling
And whenever we're together
I know I'm where I belong

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heav'n and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant Friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
I sing because I'm happy, I sing because I'm free,

Somebody should have told me
That I would feel the way I do
Somebody should have told me
I should have stayed away from you
Somebody should have told me
About the pain and the sleepless nights
Somebody should have warned me
And explain you'd never remain the same

Never would have gone this far
Knowing you for what you are

I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl you used to know so long ago
I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go and I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone

CHORUS
And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my the live the way I feel
No matter what, I'll keep it real you know
Time for me to do it on my own

It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lies
And if you don't know by now
