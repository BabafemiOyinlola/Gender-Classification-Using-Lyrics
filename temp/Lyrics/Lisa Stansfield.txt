This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows
If you don't demand, it shows
That you understand the light
Shining inside us

It's more than tonight
It's forever more, it's right
When there's someone there 'til the light
To hold you close

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seein' love and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows
It's a special thing, it's a love

Mighty love, Mighty love
It's once in a lifetime, and this time, it's mine

Never ever, ever gonna let you go
'Cause I'm always gonna love you
There's so much you haven't seen that I can show you
But I never wanna shove you
Maybe ladies come and maybe ladies go
(But I'll tell you) this lady's stayin'
And if you don't want to rush it we can take it slow

Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, this is

A mighty love, a mighty love

People say they care, but when it come down to it
Do they have what I'm singing for

Let's sing it for
Sincerity
Sincerity

People, rushin' 'round in their lonely lives
They'd like to care for others, but frankly,
They don't have the time
'Cause they're always doin' the things
They have to do so they'll be alright
Their always lookin' out for their own side
People think they've got priorities right

Sincerity
The road we need to travel for a better way of life

I ain't puttin' you in no cage
I ain't puttin' no chains on you, baby
The love in Me

If you believe in love then you'll believe in me
'Cause I'm everythin' you want
And baby, I'm everything you need
I know where you're coming from
'Cause I'm a woman
I'm freer than the breeze
And fresher than the air that you breath

Ohhh, my heart is breakin'
Ohhh, when it's tired and achin' for love
I'll give you more

It's the love in me, has to be, all that you need
A love that less, can't possess

But I'll find him, somewhere, somehow
I've got to let him know how much I care
I'll never give up looking for my baby

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh oh so bad
And I don't think he's comin' back, mm mm

He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said thing he hadn't said before
And he was oh oh so mad
And I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

Wasted too much time
Now I'm here and cryin', I, I, I

You look dowdy in that dress

But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know

Would it be outrageous to you?
Could I make you happy,
With a smile?
Could I take one moment of your time?

Well this feelin' is so strong,
And I don't even know your name,
I've waited for so long, so long,
I've never been so sure,
And I'm not playing games,
I'm gonna dive in at the deep end...

When this world
The real life world you're living in
Just gets too much for you to take
When you find
Too many troubles on your mind
And feel just like there's no escape

And it seems your heart forgotten how to believe
Turn a page in your soul
There's a place you can go

It's so natural, the way you touch me
So natural, the way you run your fingers through my hair
It's so natural, the way you make me feel like I'm a lady
Natural, the way you care, it's so natural

When I feel low, you pull me higher
You warm me up, set me on fire
Well there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

You come home and I am waiting for you
To come over and give me hungry kisses
Of the love, of the love, of the love so true
And there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

Now I've started all over
Now not a day goes by when
I'm not sure you're the one

'Cos you give me something baby
It's a feeling I just can't contain
You give me something baby
And it's something I'll never find again

You give me love you give me life
Darlin' what more can I want
I'm never gonna fail in love again
You're givin' me something more and I know
I won't be searching no more
I'm never gonna fall in love again

And I'm not gonna run or gonna hide away
No more tellin' all those lies

No more livin' in chains
No, I don't give a damn what the people say
There's no use holdin' back desire
We've burnt our fingers now lets jump into the flames

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm

Gonna walk out hand in hand
So let them criticize 'cos they don't understand

They play the game, play hard to get
Then it all goes wrong and they end up being lonely

Got me missing you
You've got me missing you

At the time it seemed okay
Nothing too serious I said
Just two people having fun
Or so I thought

At the time I was playing it cool
I had it all under control
But then I broke the golden rule
I went and said, "You'd never have me"

People hold on

Everybody's looking for a meaning
Everybody's doing their own thing
And nobody's solving the problem
Ain't nobody helping each other

Some people give into fear
Some people give into hunger
Some of us live for the future
Some of us wonder

Give a little light, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Give a little hope, and a little trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone

People hold on
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on

If you take me straight to heaven
I could never fall
'Cos loving you is what I'm made for
I'd gladly give my all and all
It doesn't matter where I am
As long as I'm with you
You can take me high above
Whatever I've been dreaming of

In all the right places, it's feeling so good
In all the right places. just like it should
And I swear, I love you

It's so natural, the way you touch me
So natural, the way you run your fingers through my hair
It's so natural, the way you make me feel like I'm a lady
Natural, the way you care, it's so natural

When I feel low, you pull me higher
You warm me up, set me on fire
Well there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

You come home and I am waiting for you
To come over and give me hungry kisses
Of the love, of the love, of the love so true
And there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

Only in my dreams I've seen the way its gonna be

Ive waited for this moment

The moment where we share ourselves

This moment cant be thought about
And
It has to be felt

Closer to each other

Closer than we've ever been

Seeing things weve never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a
Thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body hungering next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips
Carressed your hips
Now were together baby now its time
Time to make you mine

Time to make you mine

So tangled up in love

He's home again from another day
She smiles at him as he walks through the door
She wonders if it will be okay
It's hard for her when he doesn't respond

He says babe you look a mess
You look dowdy in that dress
It's just not like it used to be
Then she says...

I may not be a lady
But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know
I'm no classy lady
But I'm all woman
And this woman needs a little love to make her strong
You're not the only one

She stands there and lets the tears flow
Tears that she's been holding back so long

And I was, oh, oh, so bad

He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said thing he hadn't said before
And he was, oh, oh, so mad

The phone won't ring, you wonder why
The mail is late, and you can't wait
And then you know, and then you know

Pull you down, tear you apart
Only love can make you blue
That is all love can do

You walk alone with an aching heart
Wonder how you'll make a start
A brand new day while he's away
And then you know, and then you know

On a warm summer morning
The sun's hurting their eyes
No one is listening
'Cos they're telling lies
Then they walk along the beach
Sun rising on the shore
As it moves across the sky
A scene from a film, as time goes by

It's much more than love
This feeling is stronger
Than any they've known before
Can it go on any longer
It's much more than love
It's a spell that they're under
It's hurting their hearts again
They can't go on any longer

He says, "It's alright"

Don't stop me for the mailman
This note I don't understand
Don't stop me for the mailman

I've read it once before
And I can't believe it's true
Amazing how just one note
Can leave me sad and blue

It makes me want wanna shout
Oh throw that letter out
It's like a paper dart
It's heading for my heart
I hope it's not the truth
There's nothing left to lose
Just one more victim
Of the postal blues

Don't stop me for the mailman
This note I don't understand
Don't stop me for the mailman

I've read it once before
And I can't believe it's true
Amazing how just one note
Can leave me sad and blue
It makes me want wanna shout
Had I been a lady cop
I'd be in a state of shock

This song is for listening to
On nights you're all alone
Blank face at the window pane
Or a silent telephone

And it's all about a boy you have known
With black hair or brown hair
And hands made of stone

He had eyes like the deeps in the sky

You stop on a red light, your life starts again on green
You watch all the colours then fall back into a dream
There's headlights behind you, they flash out a silver surprise
You go for the hand brake, there's madness behind your eyes

The road goes on for mile and miles
You rush 'cos you haven't got the time
Stop, stop, stop for the red light
Yay, yay, yay is for the green
One, one, one I'm on a blue light
Keep your licence clean

You can't ask a man why he's looking smart
Ask him why he's feeling good
Make a simple gesture, like to touch his hand
And baby you are on to something good
Mmm, baby you are on to something good

Make sure that the feeling's right
Burning when I hold him tight

Loving is for people with a broken heart
Loving is for people who don't care
Love can make the potion that will keep you apart
Make sure he needs you yeah

People making offers for the peace
That moment is the one you ought to miss

You let me go
'Til I'm weared out
And when I'm ready you say you're not
You start a flame, I'm not to blame
For what I do You heat me up, I'm all aglow
I move too fast to take it slow
If you could see what you do to me
You'd feel so low

You keep me moving, don't let me stop
You got the whip, I'm your spinning top
You keep me moving, don't let me stop
You love keeps spinning me 'round

You take me up to get me high
And yet you know I can't fly

I've been watching the storm clouds gather in the distance
Follow jet planes as they move 'cross the sky
I turn my head from the TV set
I'm drowning without getting wet Then the man says
La la, la la la la la la

Hey, I've seen children in rags look on up at the cameras
Hold up their hands, wait your turn in the line
One more vision on the screen
Watch from a chair not really seeing

Then the man says

(La la, la la la la la la)
I hope you have a nice, nice day
(La la, la la la la la la)
Tune in, turn on, but forget it and the end of the day
(La la, la la la la la la)

I've seen rich men in mansions
Have their cake and eat it

With everything to lose

It's forever more, it's right

And a big, big love in your heart, so strong
Feel a hand in your hand and a whisper sweet and low
That says, "I love you", we all know what we want

Affection, it's a way of life
Direction, all of us know which way we're going
With our affection
Affection, may be big or small but we know that
We can have it all with our affection
We know which way to go

Take a walk in the sun with the one you love
And a big, big love in your heart, so strong

Love is a big thing and we've got love
We don't need nobody else
Love is a big thing and we've got love
We don't need nobody else
Love is a big thing

I'm living for your lovin', baby
And for the next time
Nothings getting in the way
There's nothing I can fight

I can wait forever, baby
To be by your side
I can wait forever, baby
To be with you again

Need your body keepin' me warm
Need your touch to keep me going

Love is a big thing and we've got love
We don't need nobody else
Love is a big thing and we've got love

Then how can you hope to survive
In this world you make your own way
No one's gonna keep you alive
If you wanna find out what it's all about
You don't know where to start
Start looking inwards towards yourself
Listen in to your heart

Listen listen, ah listen to your heart

Those who live in fear
Running from the shadows
Waiting for another year
Thought of the secrets

This is the real thing
This is the real thing

No more livin' in shame
And I'm not gonna run or gonna hide away
No more tellin' all those lies
It's been too long

No more livin' in chains
No, I don't give a damn what the people say
There's no use holdin' back desire
We've burnt our fingers now lets jump into the flames

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
This is the real thing

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm
We got somethin' stronger than strong
This is the real thing

Gonna walk out hand in hand
So let them criticize 'cos they don't understand
We've got nothin' to hide

Now I've started all over
Now not a day goes by when
I'm not sure you're the one

'Cos you give me something baby
It's a feeling I just can't contain
You give me something baby
And it's something I'll never find again

You give me love you give me life
Darlin' what more can I want
I'm never gonna fail in love again
You're givin' me something more and I know
I won't be searching no more

Whatever, whatever, babe, I'll do
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through it

I've got to keep you pleased in every way I can
Gonna give you all of me, as much as you can stand
Make love to you right now is all I want to do
I know you need it, boy, and you know I need it too

'Cause I've found what the world is searchin' for
Here, right here, my dear, I don't have to look no more
And all of my days, I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you to make me feel the way you do

Never, never gonna give you up
I'm never ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you, babe
I just can't live without you

Where in the world is my boo?

See I was fallin' asleep and you were creeping in
I never would have noticed until when
Until I smelt perfume, the kind I do not wear
My baby's been messin' around again

You shouldn't have done me babe

Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'

And I almost start to cry
Blinded by the sun I'm trying to hold onto
The very last of precious time

Then I start to thinking, what a mess we're making
And it won't get better by and by, no
Well we can paint it up and make it pretty
But we cannot overstep the line

We cannot overstep

So many baby's arms with, nothing to hold onto
But just a precious flake of life

They think you care about them
But thinking's only wasting time

It has to be felt

We're closer to each other
Closer than we've ever been
Seeing things we've never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips
Now we're together baby now it's time
Time to make you mine
Time to make you mine

How I've tried to always find a love and understanding
To always see the light of day and to know that I am living
All my life I won't take if I'm not giving

Only when the rain comes down
Only when the lightning strikes me
Will I find the answer for myself

It's got to be real
Be the best nothing less than wonderful
It's got to be real this time
What's waiting there inside
It's got to be real
Knowing love know it can be powerful
It's got to be really love
So we can rise above

It's hard for her when he doesn't respond

He says babe you look a mess
You look dowdy in that dress
It's just not like it used to be
Then she says...

I may not be a lady
But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know
I'm no classy lady
But I'm all woman
And this woman needs a little love to make her strong
You're not the only one

She stands there and lets the tears flow
Tears that she's been holding back so long

It's so natural, the way you touch me
So natural, the way you run your fingers through my hair
It's so natural, the way you make me feel like I'm a lady
Natural, the way you care, it's so natural

When I feel low, you pull me higher
You warm me up, set me on fire
Well there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

You come home and I am waiting for you
To come over and give me hungry kisses
Of the love, of the love, of the love so true
And there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

This is all we need, to be free,
To understand, and find the answer
So let's do it now, let's do it right now...

We've got to live together if we're gonna be free
We've got to find the answer right now
We've got to live together
We've got to see each other for whatever we are
We've got to solve the problem
Together
We've got to live together

Look at me, I'm the honest kind
When I say it, I mean it
I swear I need you all my life
All we need is sympathy, if we want to change our minds
This is no second thought, this is for all times
All my life

This has got to be forever
Whatever
Whatever's come, whatever's been,
It's livin' life for what we see
Promise not to lose our hope

Baby don't go
When you've nearly shown everythin' you are to me
Darling don't stray just stay here with me
'Cause that's how it ought to be

You've come this far to see who you are
See the love inside yourself
So don't be afraid I'm holdin' your hand
Just let the love run freely through me

You're so tangled up in love
Searchin' for you soul, searchin' for yourself
So tangled up in love
That you can't see anythin' else

My oh my
Do I have to tell you how to live your life
Ooh baby don't you know now that you're mine
You've got so set your lovin' free

And there's something strange when you hold my hand
Tell my why you changed the way that we were

Could we be the same, could we try again

Only in my dreams
I've seen the way it's gonna be

I've waited for this moment
The moment when we share ourselves
This moment can't be thought about
It has to be felt

We're closer to each other
Closer than we've ever been
Seeing things we've never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips
Now we're together baby now it's time
Time to make you mine
Time to make you mine

And we're not playin' games
And we're not playin' lovers
We mean a lot more than that

Hear what I'm sayin' boy
Let go and be my joy
I have to love you

You can't deny it, baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it, baby
No two people ever felt this way

You can't deny it, baby
We drive each other crazy

Let it out, let it out

For you to understand what this means

I stood all the jealousy all the bitching too
Yes I forgot all once in bed with you
Ooh darling how could we end up like this
Ooh baby let me reminisce

And when we ooh we stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire my one desire was to love you
And think of you with pride and to keep you satisfied
Ooh baby, ooh baby

Everybody's doing their own thing
And nobody's solving the problem
Ain't nobody helping each other

Some people give into fear
Some people give into hunger
Some of us live for the future
And some of us wonder

Givin' into life, givin' into love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Givin' into hope, and into trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone

Don't do yourself wrong

Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining, we just live for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don*t know
The rest of my life's been just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true

But I've got somethin' better

Come closer, much closer
Kiss and confide
One taste and be sure you'll find sugar inside

I feel your caress
I'm undressed by your eyes
There'll be no inhibition tonight

Open up, show me love, turn up the music
Tear me up, turn me on
We got the bomb - baby let's use it
Open up, show show love, turn up the music

And it's time to help yourself
To all the things you've only dreamed about

You don't know what's up
Oh let me just show you baby
Everything feels so low down
You know where to go
Pick yourself right up
Lookin' right inside
You can make it better baby, you can make it better

You've got to live your life
You can do that
You've got to make it right
You can do that
You got to let some light in your life

Don't be afraid to cry
You can do that
Don't be afraid to take a look inside
You can do that
It's just a state of mind
It's all right

There's no more turning back

Not a cloud up in the sky
The flowers are just coming into bloom
All the lovers walk together hand in hand
But paradise is nothing without you

I didn't move your coffee cup
The cigarettes that you gave up
All memories of things we used to do
Now I don't even bother with my make-up
I just wanna turn around and wake up with you

To hold on forever
A lifetime you said
So you can see it came as a surprise
After all the promises you made

Suggest it and I'll do it
There ain't nothing to it
'Cos it feels so good for me
It's wickedly delicious
I've got my three wishes
And baby when you want me

It's like taking candy from a baby
And it's sweeter than sweet
When you're right here with me
It's like taking candy from a baby
'Cos you do it to me every time
Yes you do

The way I want you babe
It's embarrassing
I can't control myself
It's just too much for me
I can't concentrate
I don't know what to say
Except your name baby
The sweetest name

And when we kiss that kiss
That's when it hits
With my heart and soul I say this

8 letters, 3 words, one meaning
In my heart
8 letters, 3 words, one feeling
When it starts

Now it's time to say goodbye
But I'll always be there in your mind
We've had our time, so let's not cry
Whenever you wander, never wonder why

And I hope that sometimes, you'll look back and see

Wish on me
And I will be the best that I can be
And I'll wish on you
And all the very best that you can do

And if they never come

Do I sit alone at home?
Do I pick up the telephone?
Can I keep my self-control with my best friend's boyfriend?

It more than my life's worth to hit on you
The water's too deep but the passion is too
I've got your number in my pocket and your body on my mind
Oh baby why must life be so unkind?

Of all the people it could be
To come and test my loyalty
If only it was anyone but you

'Cos you're my best friend's boyfriend
How am I supposed to handle that now baby?
She's away for the weekend
I just hope my conscience holds me back
I know what my heart says

Just before you go let me explain
That I love you

I know that this may come as a surprise
How do you think I felt when I realised?
It hit me like a bolt out of the sky
That I love you

You said that you were moving on
Come Saturday that you'd be gone
I thought of life without you and I cried
So finally I know who I
Am gonna love for all my life
So say you'll be mine

Until it was too late
So fooled by your disguise, carried away
I thought you were my friend

But things change and you along with them
Gone are the days when
We laughed through the night
And it will never be the same

I said it wouldn't last forever didn't I, didn't I?
Don't want to say I told you so but didn't I?
I gave you all my heart and soul and didn't I cry?
But somewhere deep in your heart
Deep down inside, I got to you
Oh baby didn't I?

Don't cry for me, no
Gotta make it on my own
Learn to be alone
Ooh baby
Don't cry for me

I feel like there's a hole in my heart

And I almost start to cry
Blinded by the sun, I'm tryin' to hold onto
The very last of precious time

Sometimes people make mistakes
They play the game, play hard to get
Then it all goes wrong and they end up being lonely
I'm one of those people

Got me missing you
You've got me missing you

At the time it seemed okay
Nothing too serious I said
Just two people having fun
Or so I thought

At the time I was playing it cool
I had it all under control
But then I broke the golden rule
I went and said, "You'd never have me"
But baby

You've got me missing you
Every day, every night
You've got me missing you
Without you this ain't a life

The moment where we share ourselves

This moment cant be thought about
And
It has to be felt

Closer to each other

Closer than we've ever been

Seeing things weve never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a
Thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body hungering next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips
Carressed your hips
Now were together baby now its time
Time to make you mine

Time to make you mine

To understand, and find the answer
So let's do it now, let's do it right now...

We've got to live together if we're gonna be free
We've got to find the answer right now
We've got to live together
We've got to see each other for whatever we are
We've got to solve the problem
Together

Look at me, I'm the honest kind
When I say it, I mean it
I swear I need you all my life
All we need is sympathy, if we want to change our minds
This is no second thought, this is for all times
All my life

This has got to be forever
Whatever
Whatever's come, whatever's been,
It's livin' life for what we see

But I've got to tell you a thing or two
Honey hear me out and sit down
Cos for some time it's been on my mind

Never had a love so strong
Never had a love so right
A love this tight
Never had a love so fine
Baby it's so divine
But you want too much time

You can't go on
Eating away at my apple heart
You can't go on
Worming your way through my apple heart

I just need a little more time
And you won't lose me
I'll love you more for it
There's nothing more exciting

Ain't nobody helping each other

Some of us live for the future

Maybe there's enough for everyone
Givin' into hope, and into trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone

Oh baby, you know I've waited, waited so long
To sing... to sing this song

Whatever, whatever, babe I'll do it
Forever and ever, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah,

Gonna give you all of me, as much or you can stand
Make love to you right now, that's all I want to do

Ooh
Ooh not one tear
No babe, ooh
Babe

The birds don't sing the same anymore
They always sounded happy before
But now there's somethin' missin'
'Cause they don't see me kissin' you
No more

My sky has fallen down through the floor
I go to sleep with no one to hold
In bed when you were near me
I didn't really feel the cold at all

I'm pickin' up the pieces now
Know I'm gonna get through somehow
Don't cry for me, no
Gotta make it on my own
Learn to be alone
Ooh baby
Don't cry for me

I feel like there's a hole in my heart

Hmm hmm

Ah
I look at the sky to, where my future's lyin'
And I almost start to cry
Blinded by the sun, I'm tryin' to hold onto
The very last of precious time
Then I start to thinkin' what a mess we're makin'
(Ooa, ooa)
And it won't get better by an' by
(Ooa, ooo)
Well we can paint it up and, make it pretty but
We cannot overstep the line
(Hmm no no)
We cannot overstep

We cannot overstep the
We cannot overstep the line
So many babies arms with
Huh nothin' to hold onto
But just a precious flake of life, ooh
You think you care about them
They think you care about them
But think it's only wastin' time
Oh, if we really want to, say the things we want to

It takes a bigger man to try, oh ho

Can't you see just what you're doing to me baby
The very thought of you is enough to drive me crazy
And the very thought of you

Every Monday I see ya
Can't wait for you walking by

Yesterday thought my world was over
Yesterday when you said good bye
Thought I'd spend my whole life just crying
Hurting inside
Ohh but you know that

I decided to pull my heart together
And chase your face from my mind, ohh yea
From this day on all the hurt is gone
I'll be fine

I cried my last tear, last night baby
And I'm not gonna cry
Never never gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry no more
 (I cried my last tear)
Ohh last night baby
 (Ooo)
And one thing it true won't be crying over you, no no
Never again

Ooh baby

You've seen it through
But I've gotta tell you, babe

I wanna be honest with you
'Bout puttin' you through this pain
It was only a sexual thing
So help me, baby
'Cause I wanna be honest now

Babe, we've gotta stop now
And take a look at ourselves
'Cause we took a good thing
And ran it down to the ground
Found myself lonely
And in need of some love

Sometimes people make mistakes
They play the game, play hard to get
Then it all goes wrong and they end up being lonely
I'm one of those people

Got me missing you
You've got me missing you

At the time it seemed okay
Nothing too serious I said
Just two people having fun
Or so I thought

At the time I was playing it cool
I had it all under control
But then I broke the golden rule
I went and said, "You'd never have me"
But baby

You've got me missing you
Every day, every night
You've got me missing you
Without you this ain't a life

Though you're weak and chilled to the bone

If there's one set of footsteps I'll be carrying you

If there's one, one set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps
If there's one, one set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps

If you're losin' faith, I'll understand
Don't be afraid I'm holding your hand
If you trust in me then I will be true
If there's one set of footsteps, I'll be carrying you

The way I want you babe
It's embarrassing
I can't control myself
It's just too much for me
I can't concentrate
I don't know what to say
Except your name baby
The sweetest name

And when we kiss that kiss
That's when it hits
With my heart and soul I say this

8 letters, 3 words, one meaning
In my heart
8 letters, 3 words, one feeling
When it starts

I want to shout it from the rooftops

Cause you wake me up and light me up
When your eyes start dancing with my mind
You fill me up and cheer me up
I wanna tell you time after time

Every little thing that I do reminds me of you
All I wanna do is make love to ya
I breathe in and breathe out in every breath there's no doubt
All I wanna do is make love to ya

You've put a spell on me

I wouldn't change a single thing

I wouldn't see your smiling face

I'll always be there and I'll always care

Honey don't you worry, there's nothing to worry for
'Cos if I didn't love you, I wouldn't be here now
And if I didn't want you, I would have turned around by now

You've got to believe me babe, believe that I love you so
'Cos if I didn't love you, I would have turned around
And if I didn't want you, then I would want you out

I've waited for this moment
The moment when we share ourselves
This moment can't be thought about
It has to be felt

We're closer to each other
Closer than we've ever been
Seeing things we've never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips
Now we're together baby now it's time
Time to make you mine
Time to make you mine

And when I swore

I knew the man was trouble
They gave me a shovel
And I digged him in

To always see the light of day and to know that I am living

Only when the lightning strikes me

Shining inside us

It's more than tonight
It's forever more, it's right
When there's someone there till the light
To hold you close

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seeing love and seeing it clearly

I don't know where my baby is
But I'll find him, somewhere, somehow
I've got to let him know how much I care
I'll never give up looking for my baby

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was, oh, oh, so bad
And I don't think he's coming back, mm mm

He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said thing he hadn't said before
And he was, oh, oh, so mad
And I don't think he's coming back, coming back

I did too much lying
Wasted too much time
Now I'm here and crying, I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I

Now you're nothing near the way that you were
And there's something strange when you hold my hand
Tell my why you changed the way that we were
Tell my why you changed the way that we were

Could we be the same?
Could we try again?

What did I do to you, baby?
What did I do to you, baby?

You never touch my skin, in the way you did

So natural the way you run your fingers through my hair
It's so natural the way you make me feel like I'm a lady
Natural the way you care, it's so natural

When I feel low you pull me higher
You warm me up, set me on fire
Well there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

You come home and I am waiting for you
To come over and give me hungry kisses
Of love, of love, of love so true
And there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

I searched, I found and I lost love
Now I've started all over
Now not a day goes by when
I'm not sure you're the one

'Cos you give me something baby
It's a feeling I just can't contain
You give me something baby
And it's something I'll never find again

You give me love you give me life
Darlin' what more can I want
I'm never gonna fail in love again
You're givin' me something more and I know
I won't be searching no more
I'm never gonna fall in love again

I wake and feel you by my side

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
This is the real thing
This is the real thing

No more livin' in shame
And I'm not gonna run or gonna hide away
No more tellin' all those lies
It's been too long

No more livin' in chains
No, I don't give a damn what the people say
There's no use holdin' back desire
We've burnt our fingers now lets jump into the flames

Never mind the stars in the sky
Never mind the when and the why
Got a feelin' higher than high
This is the real thing

Never mind the rain and the storm
We'll keep each other warm
We got somethin' stronger than strong
This is the real thing

Gonna walk out hand in hand
So let them criticize 'cos they don't understand
We've got nothin' to hide

Until I smelt perfume, the kind I do not wear

Got me missing you

At the time it seemed okay
Nothing too serious I said
Just two people having fun
Or so I thought

At the time I was playing it cool
I had it all under control
But then I broke the golden rule
I went and said, "You'd never have me"

I'll never give up looking for my baby

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh oh so bad
And I don't think he's comin' back, mm mm

He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said thing he hadn't said before
And he was oh oh so mad
And I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

I did too much lyin'
Wasted too much time
Now I'm here and cryin', I, I, I

Kick off my shoes and wait on you
Well it's way past dawn and you're still gone
Where in the world is my boo?

Until I smelt perfume the kind I do not wear

Look at me, I'm the honest kind

I swear I need you all my life
All we need is sympathy, if we want to change our minds
This is no second thought, this is for all times
All my life

I was back in the old dayslong ago
When we were kids when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shinin'
we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few

Burning below me
And a million blazing taxis
Raising a roar

Here I sit, above the town
In my pet palliated gown
Down in the depths
On the ninetieth floor

While the crowds in all the nightclubs
Punish the parquet
And the bars are packed with couples
Calling for more

She smiles at him as he walks through the door
She wonders if it will be okay
It's hard for her when he doesn't respond

He says babe you look a mess
You look dowdy in that dress
It's just not like it used to be
Then she says...

I may not be a lady
But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know
I'm no classy lady
But I'm all woman
And this woman needs a little love to make her strong
You're not the only one

She stands there and lets the tears flow
Tears that she's been holding back so long

And I don't know where he can be, my baby

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was, oh, oh, so bad
And I don't think he's coming back, mm mm

He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said thing he hadn't said before
And he was, oh, oh, so mad

Wasted too much time

That you understand the light
Shining inside us

It's more than tonight
It's forever more, it's right
When there's someone there till the light
To hold you close

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seeing love and seeing it clearly
