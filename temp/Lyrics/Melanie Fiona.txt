It's sad that memories never die
Just fill your head with why
Then you're caught living a lie again
Its sad that all he ever said
Was that he loved me to death
But that he's gone again and I was wrong again

Cause you think its easier easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
Cause I need you back
Cause I'm slowly dying
Cause I need you bad
But your gone
And never coming back
Gone and not coming back

The first time you shot me down I was grazed
Second round was never found, ricocheted
Nowhere to run, I was stunned in a daze
A victim of a love I can't escape
I remember when you said you loved me
Three little words that burned into my soul
Maybe you didn't mean those things you told me
Maybe you didn't really mean those words at all

Sitting here feeling kinda crazy
But not just any crazy
It's the kind you feel when you love somebody
And I know that my baby
Is calling somebody else baby
And I can't sit still
Look how gone it got me

Who knew that my heart could ever bruise
You see this scar here on my chest
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed

It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This motherfucker thinking I'm stupid
He must have bumped his head
I only know it's 4 AM

All that I feel I cant even explain
But I know not a day goes
I don’t go, Imma wait for you

But you keep me on an island
At best you’re distant and at worst you’re hiding
Whats on your mind, baby tell me the time
I try to break though your guard
But its so damn hard child
My heart beats every beat for you
I hurt when you’re hurt
I’m blue when you’re blue
And I’m fighting but even the greatest of walls withstand

My love is strong
But its weary from the climb
Why can’t you help me
Can’t you help me please break down your walls

About his brand new car
I know that he drives you crazy
Guess the only option is to fall
When you get push too far
You think about the next time maybe
When it`s calling a name on it
When he needs you back in his life cause
Cause he`s got some secrets
And all of the came out
When he`s calling your name
He can`t make the payment
He needs you to stay

But you wanna to go
I know, I know

Cause I`ve been that girl

Where were you, when I needed a friend
Thought I could be strong
Never knew I'd be so alone
A heart breaker, most of my life
Suddenly all changed
The moment you left me
And walked out my life
I tried to play cool
But instead I was playing myself
What you gotta know about me
Is I'm dying in this lonely hell

And I don't wanna be without you
Cause I can't hardly breathe without you
This is what it feels to be the one
Who's standing left behind
How did I become the wrong side of a love song?

Baby, I'm a mess

Loving you is like running, running on the line
Is like Im chasing down the love, theres no finish line inside

Feels like Im running, running on the line

Promises were all I got, it might mean nothing to you

You said you love me but you left
Lord knows I really did my best

Hoping that the possibility

I could really use some sleep,
But you still won't let me rest
Must've fallen way too deep

Oh yeah, I’ve got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you don’t come home at night
But when yo do you always start a fight

But I can’t be alone, I need you to come on home
I know you’re messing around
But who the hell is, is gonna hold me down

I gotta be out my mind
To think it’s gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other side still believes

And it kills me to know
How much I really love you
So much I wanna ooh, ooh, ooh
To you, ooh, ooh

Sitting here feeling kinda crazy
But not just any crazy
It's the kind you feel when you love somebody
And I know that my baby
Is calling somebody else baby
And I can't sit still
Look how gone it got me

Who knew that my heart could ever bruise
You see this scar here on my chest
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed

It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This motherfucker thinking I'm stupid
He must have bumped his head
I only know it's 4 AM
