And I’m so glad that you’ve rectified my mind
This will be an everlasting love on me
Oh, oh
Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you show me just how much you care
You’ve given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you’ve got more thrills to spare, oh
This will be an everlasting love, oh yes it will now
You’ve brought a lot of sunshine into my life
You’ve filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you, ooh
This will be, you and me, yes-sir-ee, eternally
Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing
Together, forever, through rain or whatever

Everywhere I go, in every face I see the sign of love
Shining so brightly, its in the air, its everywhere, I can feel it in my bones
People holding hands, making love, really, really getting it on
I'm crazy 'bout lovers, beautiful lovers, everywhere
Yeah, yeah, lovers, beautiful lovers, everywhere

I can't break away from you
Ooh, there's something about you that I can't explain
I get excited when I hear your name
I can't break away from you
Deep in my mind you're always here
Whenever I turn you're always near
Oh, just can't, just can't, just can't
I've only known you for a little while
Yet, I can truly say I dig your style
Even the way you call my name
It sounds like a song the angels sang
Just being near you gives me satisfaction
I tell you it's some new kind of action
Your love I could never, ever turn away
Why don't you hear me when I try to say
I can't break away from you
You're like a mirror in the back of my mind

Have you been to the very top of the highest hill
Where the air is fresh and sweet and the sky is so clear
Looking out on the country side and the view of the villages so far away
There is nothing to feel, nothing to feel
Come with me, won't you take my hand
Let's explore this heaven right here on earth, peaceful living is here
Me and you on this mountaintop with our love we will never stop
'cause we both know peaceful living is right here
And here we are in utopia where the sun never seems to go away

You make my heart warm
And a little more love is born
And I'm caught up once again on you
Soft as a rose, your tenderness glows
But you're so strong
And I know I'm gonna love you long
Well, crazy maybe
But I've seen paradise
Here in your eyes
I'm in seventh heaven
Ooh, there's nothing quite
Like spending your life
With a special someone
It feels so right
When the lights are out
And I'm in the dark

The motion over comes me
In the middle of the night
You left the space beside me
So I hold my pillow tight
The tears that always find me
Are no where near my eyes
There's nothing there and you Would swear there's a heart that's
Turned to stone tonight
After all The times I let all my feelings show
This time I just can't let go

Cause I can't cry
Can't cry
Though the tears would feel the ocean
I can't cry
Can't cry
Like I did before I can't deny this heart still badly broken but I can't cry no more
No.

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara, 'Til the sun freezes over, 'Til the

L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very, very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore can love

It's all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it

I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realize he's there
When I turn the light off and turn over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon

But suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love 'til eternity

Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes

He's so very understanding
And he's so aware of all my situations

Well, I've been a lot of places
And I've seen a lot of things
I met all kinds of people
Including queens and kings

Had my share of heartbreak
Stabbed me in my back
I cried to my friends about it
And they talked a lot of slack

But oh, what a revelation
When much to my surprise
Then came you, wonderful you
Right before my eyes

5 minutes away, 5 minutes away
You know I been
All around the world to find
It was right at my door

5 minutes away, 5 minutes away
I found love, love
Just minutes away

Everybody's got a story
And it ain't nothing new

I had a lotta fun tonight
Would you like to come in for a minute?
I could fix you some coffee or a nightcap
I know it's late but
But the truth is
I just don't wanna be alone tonight
What I'm really tryin' to say is
I wanna love you
Over and over again
I wanna see what's goin' on
In your head
(Over and over)
Hey, hey, hey, baby
Don't say goodnight
Not when you know
Not when you know
It's time for love
I wanna feel you
I just wanna thrill you, boy

Listen as your day unfolds
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky

Lovers, they may cause you tears
Go ahead, release your fears
Stand up and be counted
Don't be ashamed to cry

You gotta be, you gotta be bad
You gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough
You gotta be stronger

You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm
You gotta stay together
All I know, all I know
Is love will save the day

Herald what your mother said
Read the books your father read
Try and solve the puzzles
In your own sweet time

Some may have more cash than you
Others have a different view
My, oh, my, hey, hey, hey

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold
You gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough
You gotta be stronger

Walking my baby back home,
Arm in arm over meadow and farm,
Walking my baby back home.

We go along harmonizing a song,
Or I'm reciting a poem,
Owls go by and they give me the eye,
Walking my baby back home

I snuggle my head to his chest
We started to pet and that's when I get
My powder all over his vest!

Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about

It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true

So what do you think
Maybe he'll buy you a drink
And run his fingers through your hair
Apologize for having to stare
But he's never seen such a face
What's it doing in such a place
Says he knows a little spot
That he thinks you'll like a lot
So he takes you in his car
Background repeats (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Says it isn't far
And you end up at his home
Ah, but you knew that's where you were going
And he turns his stereo on
Makes you feel like you belong
And you end up in his bed
You're great was all he said
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he loves you
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he cares
You're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he wants you

You were my best friend, I'm sorry I hurt you but I loved him, loved him
You said I'd get hurt in the end, you tried to warn me with good advice
Instead of listening, I paid the price, yes I did, you told me back then
You said he'll love you, leave you, you said his heart was cold as ice
And you were right girl, yes, he played me for a fool, (you were right girl)
Hmm, it all came true, (you were right girl), I know

You really made a hit with me
Mr. Melody, Mr. Melody
You are my melody, you do the sweetest things to me

Oooh...

This will be an everlasting love
This will be the one I've waited for
This will be the first time anyone has loved me.

I'm so glad you found me in time
And I'm so glad that you recrefied my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me

Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you showed me just how much you care

It was staring me straight in my eyes
I've got love (love) on my mind (ooh)

I've got love (love) on my mind (ooh)
When you touch me I can't resist
And you've touched me a thousand times

I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching
Oh, but we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly
Oh, but Darling can't you see that, there's no one more important to me

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you

I got ways to make you
Make you tell me all about it
That's what I'm gonna do
Till you tell me all about it
Making love till you do
Till you tell me all about it

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your style
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart

Oh I know you're saying right now, what does she know
Who is she to tell me about my situation, well, I don't know your situation
But whatever it is, you should try to stay together
You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember
Well, today its not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey
Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about
him
It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house
But never paid any attention to, like helping with the groceries
And helping in the yard and painting and repairing and huh, paying the bills
But you know now, all I have is memories and regrets
I could have given our love a chance to grow but no

Maybe he'll buy you a drink
And run his fingers through your hair
Apologize for having to stare
But he's never seen such a face
What's it doing in such a place
Says he knows a little spot
That he thinks you'll like a lot
So he takes you in his car
Background repeats (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Says it isn't far
And you end up at his home
Ah, but you knew that's where you were going
And he turns his stereo on
Makes you feel like you belong
And you end up in his bed
You're great was all he said
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool

After all The times I let all my feelings show
This time I just can't let go

Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child
But my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself

This child that you've delivered, will soon deliver you.

Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?

A kiss in the rain till the sun shine through

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do

If you've got a good man, you'd better keep him,
Oh I know you're saying right now, what does she know
Who is she to tell me about my situation, well, I don't know your situation
But whatever it is, you should try to stay together
You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember
Well, today its not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey
Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about him
It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house
But never paid any attention to, like helping with the groceries

I have seen the bluest skies, rainbows that would make you cry
I have seen miracles that moved my soul, days that changed my life

Seen all the wonders of the world, but I've never seen a smile

I wanna know, when can we get together
Some day (some day), some way (some way)
You're a miracle boy, that's what you are (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
You're that part of me that I been missing (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Before you came along I was alive, that's true
But I was just barely, barely attempting, yeah
Can we get together, baby, baby
Please can we get together again
Oh, when can we get together
Some day, (some day) some way (some way)

I wonder who will lift us out of sadness, and will not fear the change, and won't they be surprised to find it rearranged. I wonder do we know who is to carry on I wonder don't misunderstand my feelings. I am searching just like you. I would like to know for sure, If you'll see me through, and if we're still in tune. Oh can I trust in you? There's something we must do.

You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember
Well, today its not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey
Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about

It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house

Alright yaul, oh, oh, oh
(uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh)
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah
Feels like my battery's in need of a jump
Our love is running down, done fell into a slump
Give me a spark to get the fire burning
A get my engine movin, set these wheels a turnin
Our love could use some rejuvination
You bring the wine, I'll bring the sweet conversation
Romance is here to stay, I'll testify 'cause I need some today
So won't cha
Jump start my heart
Charge me up when I'm runnin down
Oh, jump start my heart
Lift my feet up off the ground
When it comes to lovin', Baby
Can't get enough, hot wire me
Satisfy me, don't give me up
Turn on the heat on a cold winter's morning
Don't let the seasons change and nature catch me callin
Can't let this feelin just slip away
Our love was meant to last forever and a day
We can't neglect what we cherish the most
So drop your foolish pride 'cause I need you more and more
(Nothing good comes easily)

Though I think I really know you
And you think you know me
And we're as close at two people
Could ever hope to be
Still I can't escape the feeling
That no matter what I do
I'll never understand what it feels like to be you
I get the urge to know you better
To make our spirits one
I want to see us be together

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Oh, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Mm, hmm
Who's gonna take the blame tomorrow
If we break up tonight
If we break up
Who's gonna stop this stupid war
That nobody's gonna win
The jury's still out on us
Split decision, split in two
By the things that came between us
So unimportant now
All of those fights
Why do we always hurt the ones
We care the most about
The jury's still out on us

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world such as this is
Love has ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun (sun)
When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
No, no, no
And the moment I can feel (feel that) that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Ooh, ooh
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Stand up, stand on your own
That's what they tell me
You can make it alone

Where does it say I have to move
Far away from you
To prove I'm strong?

Oh, when all it really proves
Is I'm lonely without you
And loneliness has to be wrong

I live for your love
(Everyday)
Every minute
I live for your love
(In my life)
Want you in it
I live for your love
I admit it
I live for your love

I wake up with no one to kiss
Sometimes I wonder
(Wonder, wonder)

ya yeh ya, heyey ya, oh woh woh woh woh, ah ah ah ahh

say goodbye to all of your friends
and the people we knew
its better that it comes from you
tell them what you want
cause I tried so hard to make you happy
no big star dreams, no things that seem
to make up your life
so I'm going back to new york city
where people live

in my reality
all of my life
yours was no good for me
need to feel the beat
of the street, in my life
in my reality
back to my life
yours was no good for me
3000 miles away
and everydays a new day

all those dreams that pulled us apart
and the things that you want
they'll never be enough for you
so I'll say goodbye

I been here, I been round
I've been trying to put you down, but cha'
Don't know how to treat a woman like me

I've been up, I've been down
I've been thrown on the ground, but you don't
Have to slap my face, 'cause that's not
The way to do what you want me to do

You've gotta love me,
You've got to give it to me
You've got to hold me
You've got to make everything alright
You've got to show me that you need me
Even when it huts a little
Because I'm the one that you need

If there was ever a chance
That the moon would never shine again
If there was ever the slightest doubt
That tomorrow the sun would somehow not come out
If such a thing could possibly come true
It wouldn't matter to me
Because i love you

More than the moon
More than the sun
More than the stars

If for some reason all the seasons should fade
away
O what if suddenly we discovered that the
world's not round
At all it's flat
Tomorrow such a thing could possibly be
But nothing could mean as much as you do to me
'cause i love you more

More than the moon
More than the sun

What I must do to hold you in my hands
Is give you all I have and be right here with you

Something happened on the way
Something I don't want to lose
Stared my heart right in the face
Telling me the truth, telling me it to you

What I must do to hold you in my hands
Is be right here with you
I know that I need to give you all I am
And this time we make it stand, stand right here with you

Of all the things I wanted most
Here you are, the one I need

Good-bye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Good-bye, let our hearts call it a day

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love

Everywhere I go, in every face I see the sign of love

Thinkers think about love till it comes out their ears
Drinkers drink about love and they cry in their beers
Now you can think about it, drink about it
But if you're on the brink about it
Don't fall till you know all about love

Singers croon about love sing with sadness and pain
A tycoon about love spends a fortune in vain
Sing a dirge about it, splurge about it
But if you're on the verge about it
Don't fall till you know all about love

You must examine your motives clearly
Look at the facts sincerely
Or you mess up very dearly if you don't

Writers write about love till their fingers are sore
Fighters fight about love till their flat on the floor
You can write about it, fight about it

Oh, girl, I was stepping out, yeah
I was on my way to meet my steady
When this fine young thing turned me right around
At first I was frightened
Because he took me, he took me by surprise, whoo
But my heart knew that it was a hold-up
I could see the love light shining in his eyes

Right then I was held up
Girl, I was held up
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door
Yes, I was held up
My heart was held up
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door

The way he stole my affection
Oh, girl, you know that it ought to be a crime
Mm-hmm, and the way that he changed my direction
I had no projection
And I swear to you that I ain't lyin'
Oh-hoo, love was right here among me
I never knew that heaven could be so close
I was on my way to meet my steady
When right next door is what I needed most

Oh, I was held up

Oh, I was held up by Billy the Kid next door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was held up

In this world of make believe I must confess

To be number one you've got to do it better

And if you strive to be happy you'll find success

Perspectively you've got to pull it together

Nothing good will come to you if you don't see

A reason for victory

Everybody loves the winner

Only the winner can really make things happen

Everybody loves the winner, so be the winner, I know you are

If there's something you'd like to do you've never done

Don't let fear stand in your way

Just collect your dreams and thoughts and get on the run

I wouldn't wait another day

You can be the best in everything you do

You're my morning star shining brightly beside me
And if we keep this love
We will last through all eternity
It's just the way we are I love it, love it
It's just the way it should be

'Cos our love will stand tall as the trees
Our love will spread wide as the seas
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above
And we'll always be together, our love

My love is surely one thing
You can surely depend on
In times of darkness and fear I go to you
I know you'll make me strong
You're gonna make me happy
You're gonna make me smile

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

I see reflections going in the air
Telling me the way to move
I feel the spirit and it's everywhere
Telling me it's time to groove

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right
Mm, yeah

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

I must get out
I'm going crazy here
The time has come for me to say

Goodbye to all the
Things I used to fear
So long to lonely yesterday

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right

Oh, I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

Whoa, oh, come on

Love comes from God, surely, surely, surely you can see that
If you check out your heart, there's a part that you're keeping from me
Why don't you hold on tight, make this flight, we've got the whole night
Saddle up your gear, have no fear, we are here, hey
Better make it soon, give me room, come on and stand by me
Come on and stand by, cause there is no time, no time to sit

The time is turning back somehow
As soon as our hearts and souls unite
I know for sure we'll get the feeling right

And now we're starting over again

If there was ever a chance
That the moon would never shine again
If there was ever the slightest doubt
That tomorrow the sun would somehow not come out
If such a thing could possibly come true
It wouldn't matter to me
Because i love you

More than the moon
More than the sun
More than the stars

If for some reason all the seasons should fade
away
O what if suddenly we discovered that the
world's not round
At all it's flat
Tomorrow such a thing could possibly be
But nothing could mean as much as you do to me
'cause i love you more

More than the moon
More than the sun

The very thought of you,

the little ordinary things
that everyone ought to do.

I'm living in a kind of daydream.
I'm happy as a king.
And foolish though it may seem
to me, that's everything.

This day and age we're living in
Gives cause for apprehension
With speed and new invention
And things like fourth dimension.

Yet we get a trifle weary
With Mr. Einstein's theory.
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension

Of And no matter what the progress
Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts life are such
They cannot be removed

Your love, like wine. Tasting sweeter to me every day
Your kiss, devine. And it melts the cold inside away
All of my life, I've been waiting for a love like this
And now, that you're here romance is just a second away.
It's gonna stay

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara, 'Til the sun freezes over, 'Til the
Mojave red turns into blue
'Til my lungs get tired of breathing, and my heart stops it's beating,
then I'll stop loving you.

And in the dark, when there's no one calling out your name.

Well, today its not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey
Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about

It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house

So what do you think
Maybe he'll buy you a drink
And run his fingers through your hair
Apologize for having to stare
But he's never seen such a face
What's it doing in such a place
Says he knows a little spot
That he thinks you'll like a lot
So he takes you in his car
Background repeats (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Says it isn't far
And you end up at his home
Ah, but you knew that's where you were going
And he turns his stereo on
Makes you feel like you belong
And you end up in his bed
You're great was all he said
Chorus:
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he loves you
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he cares
You're nothin' but a fool

You said he'll love you, leave you, you said his heart was cold as ice
And you were right girl, yes, he played me for a fool, (you were right girl)

Sailing over a cardboard sea

Travel my way, take the highway that's the best

More than two-thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks, on Route 66.

This can't be love, because I feel so well,

This can't be love; I get no dizzy spells,
My head is not in the skies.

My heart does not stand still, just hear it beat.
This is too sweet to be love.

I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the Wheel of Life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingué traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock-tails

Then you came along with your siren song

Oh I know you're saying right now, what does she know

Who is she to tell me about my situation, well, I don't know your situation

But whatever it is, you should try to stay together

You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember

Well, today its not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey

Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about
him

It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true

You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house

But never paid any attention to, like helping with the groceries

And helping in the yard and painting and repairing and huh, paying the bills

So what do you think
Maybe he'll buy you a drink
And run his fingers through your hair
Apologize for having to stare
But he's never seen such a face
What's it doing in such a place
Says he knows a little spot
That he thinks you'll like a lot
So he takes you in his car
Background repeats (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Says it isn't far
And you end up at his home
Ah, but you knew that's where you were going
And he turns his stereo on
Makes you feel like you belong
And you end up in his bed
You're great was all he said
Chorus:
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he loves you
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he cares
You're nothin' but a fool
If you think that he wants you

It's hard to say how long its been, but once upon a time
You were my best friend, I'm sorry I hurt you but I loved him, loved him
You said I'd get hurt in the end, you tried to warn me with good advice
Instead of listening, I paid the price, yes I did, you told me back then
You said he'll love you, leave you, you said his heart was cold as ice
And you were right girl, yes, he played me for a fool, (you were right girl)
Hmm, it all came true, (you were right girl), I know
I should have known it all along, (you were right girl)
Yes, you were right and I was wrong, I thought you blamed him for your mistakes
That all your put downs were just sour grapes, you told me back then

I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching
Oh, but we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly
Oh, but Darling can't you see that, there's no one more important to me

Here I am, there you are
If you ask me to walk a thousand miles
Just to be where you are
I can't say no if you ask me

If I had a dime, it's yours as well as mine
I'd keep the penny, you know I would
And gladly give you the nine
I can't say no if you ask me

If you told me tonight to get up

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Even though it's been so long
My love for you keeps going strong
I remember the things that we used to do
A kiss in the rain till the sun shine through
I tried to deny it but I'm still in love with you

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you

I can see the love shining in your eyes
And it comes as such a sweet surprise
If seeing's believing it's worth the wait
So hold me and tell me it's not too late

Your love, like wine. Tasting sweeter to me every day
Your kiss, devine. And it melts the cold inside away
All of my life, I've been waiting for a love like this
And now, that you're here romance is just a second away.
It's gonna stay

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara, 'Til the sun freezes over, 'Til the
Mojave red turns into blue
'Til my lungs get tired of breathing, and my heart stops it's beating,
then I'll stop loving you.

And in the dark, when there's no one calling out your name.

Stand up, stand on your own
That's what they tell me
You can make it alone

Where does it say I have to move
Far away from you
To prove I'm strong?

Oh, when all it really proves
Is I'm lonely without you
And loneliness has to be wrong

I live for your love
(Everyday)
Every minute
I live for your love
(In my life)
Want you in it
I live for your love
I admit it
I live for your love

I wake up with no one to kiss
Sometimes I wonder
(Wonder, wonder)

Tonight, I, I just want to talk to the ladies, oh fellows your cool but girls
If you've got a good man, you'd better keep him,
Oh I know you're saying right now, what does she know
Who is she to tell me about my situation, well, I don't know your situation
But whatever it is, you should try to stay together
You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember
Well, today its not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey
Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about him
It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house
But never paid any attention to, like helping with the groceries

Hmm, thought I'd seen everything there was to see in this world
Now I'm not so sure I've really seen anything at all
I thought life could show me no surprises
And then you came and showed me I was wrong
I have seen the bluest skies, rainbows that would make you cry
I have seen miracles that moved my soul, days that changed my life
I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark
Seen all the wonders of the world, but I've never seen a smile
As beautiful as yours, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, I thought I'd been everywhere

Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way

There was something that I never knew

Our love will spread wide as the seas
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above
And we'll always be together, our love

In times of darkness and fear I go to you

Goodbye to all the

Everyday the population is growing and to find some peace of mind is something rare
Don't you get discouraged keep on going and don't you mind the way that the people turn and stare
Now how long can you keep on feeling guilty and tell me why should you feel bad about feeling good
Don't you know that the world is cold and filthy, aw yes it is, but if you're a special child
They know sometimes you'll be misunderstood, (you can never look back)
Yesterday is dead and gone, (don't you look back) your tomorrow is here today
Keep on fighting, a quitter never wins, hold your breath stick out your chin
Count to ten start again, everybody wants to be somebody
But they can't seem to see the forest for the trees, we just can't let our past
Hold back our future, oh, no, no, when it's all over but the shouting

Hm, hm

That comes in the cold
You make my heart warm
And a little more love is born
And I'm caught up once again on you
Soft as a rose, your tenderness glows
But you're so strong
And I know I'm gonna love you long
Well, crazy maybe
But I've seen paradise
Here in your eyes
I'm in seventh heaven
Ooh, there's nothing quite
Like spending your life
With a special someone
It feels so right
When the lights are out
And I'm in the dark
I'm not afraid, no
Long as I can get a piece of your heart

You know, of all the things in the world I'd miss
It would probably be music and love
They say you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
That's so true
Even though we still take it for granted
And I used to be like that but not anymore
'cause I found out what love really means
Love means happiness and dedication
Love will sometimes bring complications
But you must have faith and a whole lot of trust
Most of all you can never give up just
(hold on, hold on)
Hold on to your good thing, yeah
(hold on, hold on) forget about the small things
(hold on, hold on) do it for love, do it for love
And remember that love is a feeling
