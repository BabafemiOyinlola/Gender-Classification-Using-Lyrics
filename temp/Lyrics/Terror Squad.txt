I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mis-happenin's, nigga

Half the niggas in the squad got a scar on they face

It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad

As a young, it was too much to cope with
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick named me, Cook Coke Shit
Should've been called Don Robbery
Extortion or maybe grand larceny

I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some flow Joe shit
Fat nigga with shoty was the logo kid

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away

Don't even move a muscle
Clap at ya feet, blast ya boot buckle
Cowboy style, dance bitch, do the hustle
Let me see you sweat
Follow the leader through the streets of death
Piece the bits together till you come up wit' atleast a brick

Then we can flip that, sip Henny and kick back
Chit-chat real quick, how we gon' split that
I suggest that we bubble it all
Cop a bundle of raw, start small
See if we can double the score

I stumble across my share of obstacles
Staring death dead in the opticals
'Cuz I'm never scared of the impossible
Ask the rasta dudes if our gonja ain't the tightest
Ask the pasta dudes if our China ain't the whitest

And none of my prostitutes vaginas got the virus
If you see one in the hospital, you could bet it was violence
That's the science, my alliance is Terror Squad
If there's a God, show me a sign so I can share my scars

We in for life, ready to fight, my twins is hype
Better get it right or get deaded on sight
So take flight, make one mistake and pay twice
'Cuz shit is trife, lose your life just tryin' to break night

We in for life, under the lights but I'm outta sight
When I write sometimes I wonder if it's outta spite
I like livin' on the edge, tippin' strippers at The Wedge
Sippin' spritzers, gettin' head, it's the life we live

Play the corners at night, away from the fortunate lifes
For the gunplay, thugs auction the heist

Niggas better be calm or I'ma set the alarm
And a hundred strong'll form in shape of a bomb
My squads'll forever bomb wit a war like Lebanon
And we hardcore till we dead and gone, so go ahead and mourn

Aiyo Seis, I'm pacin back and forth
Wit thoughts of bein' trapped up North
But after I come off wit it y'all can push em out the door
So, cock the four pound
(Four pound)

Lock the fort down

From New York to Georgetown

Knockin' off clowns that clap 'em off rounds

Listen up to what it is, know a lotta mamis lovin' the triz
And some, they tryin' to pull it off right in front of the kids
Before I think about coming to cribs, I be lugging my glitz so big
On the waist it be rubbing my ribs, it's very dangerous fuckin' with this

I been doublin' chips holdin' my own with the chrome double-grips
Up in the mix, caught a couple of vics when I used to fight
But I ain't been scufflin' since this is as tough as it gets
Never leave nothin' with prints or you get blast
And you're chopped up and stuffed in the fridge

It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
Of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame, my call was to reign the streets from Harlem to
Queens
Back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as the crack
that'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
and start from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped in a giant cage
Tryin to savior these few dyin days
I have left, to the form of flesh.
Should I lie in my grave?
I'm tryin to persuade, my matto is try to be brave

Forty four metal with heat'll, open ya belly like it's legal
Push you back a few feet, send you sailin' like a seagull
When we clash in the street, why was you bailin' if you evil

Talkin' 'bout somebody tryin' to playa hate you
Actually I like you but fuck wit my squad the German A.K.'ll hit you
Ever seen what them things could do to
Cut your legs, remove your from your hip down to ya tims
I'm like the limit on ya life, the demon on ya light
That figure in the dark that takes ya heart in the mid of night
This ain't a joke 'cuz ain't nuttin' comical how my laser scope
Aim at ya dome could erase the features off ya facial bones

Yo, i'ma lay the law with a.k.'s or metaphors
Make way for the ghetto roar, these days I set it off
Y'all hardcore, that's why I batter you all
Shatter they jaw, batter the core to make a fad?
Terror squad to my death, tombstone on my chest
With the chrome in the vest, alone or with t.s.
I'ma rep it, I'm a dominican, now you accept it
It's like you seen death and chose the lord as the shepherd
You sceptical, niggas on the block ain't respectin you
Checkin you, ain't gonna stop when they deckin you
Who gon' dock you? I'm comin at you like a tackle
To leave a personal scar in your chest like a tattoo
Seis'll clap you, put your dick in the dirt
Click at a herb when I spit a clip and rip through your shirt
I'm the worst of the beast, put my work on the streets
Do the work with the heat, don't make me burst through your meat

Come at us if you ready for war

Leave you dead in your hall leakin' red on the floor
Better than y'all

Puffin pounds of marijuana wit my entourage
Camouflage in the silent fog getting charged so we'll party dark

We more cream then Carvel
For real pockets filled, 1 hundred dollar bills
Probably with the squattin' villains
Knowledge while we holla at the college girls

This how it feels to be on top of the world
Up in the pearl white drop just cruisin' the burrows
Keepin' it through from the beginning to end do for yourself
Ain't no friends in this envious world we livin' in

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Ridin in cars, out to get me eight full of shinin stars

To deal with the way my Squad puts metal to flesh
We rebels to death, leakin body heat, decimals less
My shotie completes the measure of death

I'm only 1100 double threat, beware of the rest

If my pump shotie was sweet chokes
I'd twist the whole place with three strokes
Dump this? sawed-off barrel
I send your soul to follow the blast
And see how far the noise will travel
Big Eaddie's name never lost his value

Bust my guns at the heavens till an angel fell on top of me

Robbin parties and pumpin the shotie to keep em back
Nobody move, nobody get burst open
Just give up the jewels before your purse-totin-

Marked on my flesh to make my thoughts manifest

Somebody call the cops
For us to stop'll take all of they got
Uptown and the Bronx, my Squad is legends off of the block
(Terror Squad)

Deep in the borough where the corners is smoldering hot
My team is known for smokin' the glock
To the hole in your rock
(Terror Squad)

I murder men wit the poisonous flow, my pen
Hurt 'em for they dough and they GM's wit Mac 10
No relaxin', straight action when it's on

Call up Pun and The Don, come up heavily armed
Niggas better be calm or I'ma set the alarm
And a hundred strong'll form in shape of a bomb
My squads'll forever bomb wit a war like Lebanon
And we hardcore till we dead and gone, so go ahead and mourn

Aiyo Seis, I'm pacin back and forth
Wit thoughts of bein' trapped up North
But after I come off wit it y'all can push em out the door
So, cock the four pound
(Four pound)

Lock the fort down
(Fort down)
From New York to Georgetown
(Georgetown)
Knockin' off clowns that clap 'em off rounds

It's war now, so toss the nine 'cause I'ma floss and shine
You lost your mind if you thought your rhymes was comin' close to mine
Eyes that drop signs like Einstein, applyin' the iron to your spine
And find you dyin' on prime time

It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame, my call was to reign the streets
from Harlem to Queens, back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as the crack
that'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
and start from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped, in a giant cage
Tryin to savor these few dyin days
I have left, to the form of flesh; should I lie in my grave?

See I love my thugs but I'm a terrorist nigga
And Imma terrorize ya ass till gone for miles pana
What, bitch ass nigga

I jeopardize this rap shit and blast ya ass to prove a point
I got thug nigguz that don't even rap callin' to do joints
Frontin' off the strength and you the weak link in the click
It's obvious you pussy I could see the pink in the clit
I seen the chip and my clip of my daily desert eagle
Forty four metal with heat'll, open ya belly like it's legal
Push you back a few feet, send you sailin' like a seagull
When we clash in the street, why was you bailin' if you evil
(You ain't evil)

Talkin' 'bout somebody tryin' to playa hate you
Actually I like you but fuck wit my squad the German A.K.'ll hit you
Ever seen what them things could do to
Cut your legs, remove your from your hip down to ya tims
I'm like the limit on ya life, the demon on ya light
That figure in the dark that takes ya heart in the mid of night
This ain't a joke 'cuz ain't nuttin' comical how my laser scope
Aim at ya dome could erase the features off ya facial bones

I'm like a Triple Threat
Double dare you to try to rip my neck
The way you click spit techs will leave you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way you squad niggaz rep
Comin' at me from the sideline like you intend to step

Yo, i'ma lay the law with a.k.'s or metaphors
Make way for the ghetto roar, these days I set it off
Y'all hardcore, that's why I batter you all
Shatter they jaw, batter the core to make a fad?
Terror squad to my death, tombstone on my chest
With the chrome in the vest, alone or with t.s.
I'ma rep it, I'm a dominican, now you accept it
It's like you seen death and chose the lord as the shepherd
You sceptical, niggas on the block ain't respectin you
Checkin you, ain't gonna stop when they deckin you
Who gon' dock you? I'm comin at you like a tackle
To leave a personal scar in your chest like a tattoo
Seis'll clap you, put your dick in the dirt
Click at a herb when I spit a clip and rip through your shirt
I'm the worst of the beast, put my work on the streets
Do the work with the heat, don't make me burst through your meat

I kill alive for my twin
Bust ill and do the time for my twin
Trust that it's real
And he'll be at my side at the end

I went from chillin' on the hills to signin' deals worth fitty mil
Self made millionaire status
We all gettin' money but it's funny how mine makes niggaz maddest
Come at us if you ready for war

Whoever you are
Leave you dead in your hall leakin' red on the floor
Better than y'all
Niggaz need to face the facts

Since the days of crack I been blazin' gats, tryin' to raise my stats
Tracin' back, you could find me at a racin' track
Laced in black, bettin' on a horse called Amazin' Jack
Joey Crack's the illest, fully backed my killaz

Yo no lies
When I was five I arrived in America
Made it alive survived the hell of a trip kid I'm telling ya
Sellin' the freedom town to put my feet on the ground
See whats around, then lock shit down like Nino Brown

I'm bound by hona and down for drama like Tony Man Tana
Y'all clowns don't wanna fuck around pana
Puffin pounds of marijuana wit my entourage
Camouflage in the silent fog getting charged so we'll party dark

Terror Squad my car-tel, we larger, it ain't hard to tell
We more cream then Carvel
For real pockets filled, 1 hundred dollar bills
Probably with the squattin' villains
Knowledge while we holla at the college girls

This how it feels to be on top of the world
Up in the pearl white drop just cruisin' the burrows
Keepin' it through from the beginning to end do for yourself
Ain't no friends in this envious world we livin' in

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold

And many crazy feelin' is they see their money so high grazin' cellin'

You can tell I'm comin, cause the weather strange
Armageaddon, the end of your life on whatever's in his range
Never mind the notion of savin the lives of your friends
Your sister, your cousins, your mother, even (edited)
Will go and ride with me
Through the levels of hell in this atrocity
Bust my guns at the heavens till an angel fell on top of me
He said his name was michael and introduced me to evil acts like
Robbin parties and pumpin the shotie to keep em back
Nobody move, nobody get burst open
Just give up the jewels before your purse-totin-
Ass become the first smokin
Pop shit on my records, you lock stiff in my presence
My squad gets respected for cockin the fifth and affect it
Stick a chip in your (rectum) and pull your soul out your (asshole)
And all for gettin cash with the blow I got from castro

Split dough with detectives to get my flow in protection
Through the ice on my gold you see your own reflection
Can't tell me shit about murder and movin weight
I got niggas that's off the scale that'll bust through you and your mate
It's proven today, armageaddon's comin sooner than late
We rappers that really blast, I know cuban relates
50 niggas of terror, rockin 560 leathers
Some of us are dyin to gain, but the name lives forever
Marked on my flesh to make my thoughts manifest
When I spark, no man's heart could withstand through the test
Apply the pressure like I used to do, but crack never left
I traded in my double breasted for a mac and a vest
What the f**k?

And when I'm not in the hood, I'm rocking the hood

But y'all running in circles working the same old act
