Somewhere over the rainbow

Or nothing at all
People want sincerity
And nothing more

Yes you'll find it so hard
To live without love love love

Love love love
Whoa just say yeah (oh yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
People want to live (uh huh)
Not merely exist
People want to enjoy
Not suffer and fear no no no

The best is yet to come
Can you see what I see? On the road ahead
Do you know there's a new life there
Waiting there
Give me your world and I'll give you heaven
Love will set us free as long as we believe
The best is yet to come

Runnin' hot, runnin' cold
I was runnin' into overload
It was extreme

I took it so high, so low
So low, there was nowhere to go
Like a bad dream

Somehow the wires uncrossed, the tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude

Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
I can't sit here while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire, running out of time
There's no room in this ol' heart of mine
Bill collectors waiting down the hall
Neighbors scream and crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement, passion hits the street
Angels cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy, I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door
Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone
I've got to stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now

Hmm... hmm... hmm... ha
So many times said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew I'd be lying here beside you...
On my own...

On my own...
So many promises never to be spoken

Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce and we weren't even married...
On my own... once again... now...
One more time... by... myself
No one said it was easy
No-no-no ooh no
But it once was so easy

Well I believe (I believe) in love (In love)

Now here I stand...
I wonder why
Ooh...

Yo Mister how's your daughter
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

After all of us told her,? No?
She givin' up speed ball
Now she's going nowhere stoned
Her papa caught her on the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only 17
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter)
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone
Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then she started skipping school
Then Cara got high top make disappear

When there's something in the air
And the earth is shaking
Something inside me knows
One heart went falling
A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it

The choice of how I crawl of bow
Must be mine to choose

Safe inside their dreams, is it a scheme

Who hides behind a face, but really knows

And I'll be viewed that way once... of me

Come on and hold me tight
Don't turn off the light
Just let your words embrace me
Like a fathers loving arms
Protect me from the night it will be alright
Cause tonight I'm just a little girl

A women is what a woman gives
Sometimes she gives too much, look but don't touch
Most times for me, there's not enough
When a man fall in love, with me
He moves into me like he would a house
He decorates me and lives his fantasies out

Borne of a virgin Mary

Oh, yeah, good God had made it
I already, I already, oh

Jesus, Jesus
Oh, what a wonderful child
(What a wonderful child)

Jesus, Jesus
So lowly
(Lowly, meek and mild)

New life, new hope, new joy He brings
Oh, listen to the Angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King

Jesus, Jesus
Oh, what a wonderful child

Jesus, Jesus
So lowly
(Lowly, meek and mild)

Yeah, new life, new hope, new joy He brings
Oh, listen to the Angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King

He was heralded by the Angels

I don't know how love could do this to me
I've waited and waited for someone I'll never see
But I'm so sentimental and I'm so hopeful you'll be there
Here I am every year, every Christmas

I've wished for you in my heart and in my head
I got my answer that first moment we met
Oh yes, I believed you as you told me, as you said
You'd be here every year, every Christmas

There must be a lesson for me to learn
If you don't trust in love, you'll get nothing in return
Why should I be lonely? Don't tell me it's right
Oh, I have my pride but I'd rather be with you tonight

Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by thy cradle 'til morning is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray

I believe for every drop Of rain that falls A flower grows I believe that somewhere In the darkest night A candle glows I believe for everyone Who goes astray
Someone will come To show the way I believe, I believe I believe above the storm The smallest prayer
Will still be heard I believe that someone In the great somewhere
Hears every word Every time I hear A newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf

This is a test, sugar, sugar, boo boo
This is just a test, tell me
What do you know about love
This is just a test, it ain't your life
Tell me

I'd like to give you a test
So darling, prepare yourself
When I say 'Love', please explain
What pictures pop in your brain

'Cause when you talk about love
Say when you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

Now if you need to be taught
Don't make me an after thought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good loving will be gone

Ooh, find me

Loving you so kindly

There is always a sun that's rising
When I know in your heart you're there for me
And from now on your flame just keeps me
Burnin' on

Runnin' hot, runnin' cold

I took it so high, so low
So low, there was nowhere to go
Like a bad dream

Somehow the wires uncrossed, the tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude

Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believe in love

I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

Do need you

So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew

On my own

Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married
On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

I sparkle, loving the way that I do
It is true I feel so good just having you
Breathlessly and eager, submission isn't easy for me
We were so loving wasn't we? I'd always known it could be

Don't want to do nothing, tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill, you got to know just how it feel
If you think your going to fall, all you have to do is call
I have nothing in myself and I give myself to you

Say child tingle sparkle, I hope the love never breaks away
Fire burning everyday and save all the warmth for you

My babys always dancin and it wouldnt be a bad thing

But I don't get no loving and thats no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times

Blame it on the boogie
That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me

And my baby just cant take her eyes off me
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight

Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight

Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

They could be waiting round the corner
They're such a scarifying sight to see
They could be waiting for a straying loner
They could be waiting for you or me...

The patter of footsteps through an alleyway
Impatient in the dark, they wait to pounce
hey don't look far when they want trouble
They know it at a glance...

But, imagine you look like a boy
That they want after

Yeah, uh! Get up, now!
Ow! Knock out this!

Super highways, coast to coast
Easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload
Just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel

When there's no destination that's too far
And somewhere on the way
You might find out who you are

Living in America
Eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Hand to hand, across the nation
Living in America
Got to have a celebration
Rock my soul

Smokestack, fatback
Many miles of railroad track
All night radio, keep on runnin' through

But you just don't think that you can fight it

(Don't give up)
Don't give up, don't give up, darling, what you dream

'Cause like the words here in this song
We'll go on and on and on with our love

(I wanna be)
Inside out, oh, darling
I want it to be so deep that you'll be turning me
(Inside out)
I want it to be so deep you'll be needing me

When you're lying in her bed
And you're in her arms instead of my love
As you feel her tightening grip
Like a genie I will slip from your heart

I won't give up, won't give up, won't give up
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up)

Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history

Absolutely soaking wet!

I was a dreamer
You were a dreamer
But perfection is consuming
And it seems we're only human after all
And we've both been takin' the fall

But tomorrow
We'll run a little bit faster
Tomorrow
We're gonna find what we're after at last

Please, please, please stay darling
And I will never never let you down

I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna love you like it's going out of style, oh

What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Oh, I can feel it

Something special is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special is gonna happen tonight
I promise something good for you

I think you're coming, I keep you going
You'll have kisses overflowing just like wine
You ain't had nothing

You really ought to know

Now she's going nowhere stoned
Her papa caught her on the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only 17
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter)

Then she started skipping school
Then Cara got high top make disappear

There was a time
I said "I didn't need love in my life"
I'll be alright
I always had excuses to disguise

How I felt inside
So much loneliness is hard to hide
So I'll testify
I know in your arms true love I can find

I don't want to bore you, baby
Don't wanna waste your time
I just want to be your lady
I'll keep you satisfied

It's hard to find
But your love's given me a peace of mind
So I fantasize
I think of loving you everyday and night

When there's something in the air
And the earth is shaking
Something inside me knows
One heart went falling
A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

My love waits for you
There's nothing I can do
So I'm holding back
Afraid when I can't save it all
This love I know

I'm saving it, you've got to keep
I'm saving it, your love to me
A sentimental love tonight to me
Every time it is when you love somebody

No tears, no signs
Only makes it so much harder to go on
Just take good care
And remember when you're feeling all alone

You'll be with me in my heart
And always on my mind
The only thing that keeps us apart is time

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise

I did it again, I always make the same mistake
When it comes to men I fall for the guys with the bedroom eyes
It starts out great but before too long
Mr. Right turns out to be Mr. Wrong

He said, "I love you baby, you're the best I ever knew
But I'm not ready for anyone like you
This is as far as it goes and as close as it gets"
He said, "You sure sing pretty but I don't do duets"

He walked in the room and all he had to do was smile
Waitin' in his arms, a fool would have known was a danger zone
His talk was so sweet but let there be no doubt
While I was movin' in, he was movin' out

Something is wrong, but we go on from day to day
And we just pretend it all away
We act like nothing's changed
But in our hearts we know, it's not the same, oh, no

? Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before

Say that everything's alright
But we're not makin' love, mmm, hmm

I contemplate the way life used to be

What a joy to have you there
I never thought we'd have to say goodbye

time passed and you were gone
Though it's hard, I carry on
Because I know...

Love never dies
Your laughter will remain here in this heart of mine
To ease away the pain, I miss you so
But I've learned to smile again
Love never dies

Sometimes I catch myself talking to you
As if you were standing here
Sometimes I shed a tear
'Cause you're a special part of me
Living in my memory, giving my soul wings

Turn down the lights
Let the candles light inspire
A night that burns
With the flaming loves desire

As we open our gifts
Underneath our tree
I will think of
And remember

Our first Christmas night
Under the pale moon light
Loving you felt so right
'Twas love
Kisses that melted the snow
We don't need mistletoe
Eager to take it slow
'Twas love

Working for a living sometimes the road gets hard
With the first snowflakes of winter
My heart goes straight back home
To the days when I was little before life on my own

Nothing could be better than the Christmas here with you
Family joined together, loved ones old and new
As we gather here, the season's cheer
Makes my yuletide wish come true
Nothing could be better than Christmas here with you

Somehow the wires uncrossed, the tables were turned

'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm wearing a new dress (New), new hair (New)

When there's something in the air
And the earth is shaking
Something inside me knows
One heart went falling
A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it

It must have been cold there in my shadow,
To never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way.

So I was the one with all the glory,
While you were the one with all the streanth.
A beautiful face without a name, for so long.
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Wish I was your child
Hold me in your heart
We could love so free
And no, we'd never part

But I'm not a child
And wishes are
Just child's play, my love
Now I'll never be afraid

Of who I am
And who I'm not
Come what may
Wish I was a bird

Well, I gave my heart to you
Open, so open and trusting
And you gave it back to me

Sold my heart, I sold my heart to the junkman
Sold my heart, I sold my heart to the junkman
I can never fall in love again
Oh and I know you took my heart
You thought that you could use it
When you gave it back like a toy
You broken and bruised
Sold my heart, I sold my heart to the junkman
Sold my heart, I sold my heart to the junkman
I can never fall in love again

Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down

You give good love to me, satisfy all my needs
You make me feel so alive

This word is all, I have to say
I love you in every way

With a feeling like that

You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

After all of us told her,? No?
She givin' up speed ball
Now she's going nowhere stoned
Her papa caught her on the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only 17
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter)
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone
Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then she started skipping school
Then Cara got high top make disappear

Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire, running out of time

Neighbors scream and crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement, passion hits the street
Angels cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy, I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door
Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone

Something about two lovers that changes the world

Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it

People want true things

It's you!

Sometimes end up along that road?

I'd like to give you a test
So darling, prepare yourself
When I say 'Love', please explain
What pictures pop in your brain

'Cause when you talk about love
Say when you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

Now if you need to be taught
Don't make me an after thought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good loving will be gone

Ooh, find me
You can always find me
Loving you so kindly
Your life is like candlelight

And darlin' no one told us
No one ever told us
What this love could hold for us?
Maybe we were meant to find it faithfully

There is always a sun that's rising
When I know in your heart you're there for me
And from now on your flame just keeps me
Burnin' on

When there's something in the air
And the earth is shaking
Something inside me knows
One heart went falling
A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it

I won't stay here locked behind the door
Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on

I remember when
I was five and you were ten, boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it

You can buy her things
Shiny diamond rings

Promise all the stars in the sky
But that won't get you very far
That won't get you in her heart

Something deep and true
Is what she needs from you

When a woman loves
She loves with everything
She can touch your heart
And steal your soul
But you've got to earn her trust
To feel her touch
To be the one she's loving
When a woman loves

New day
Pushing ahead till my goal gets nearer
New day
Spread my wings
I'm doin' things my way
It's a new day

Wasn't sure where I should begin
Couldn't tell my beginning from the end

Been 'round the world and back again, it starts from within, yes

Open my eyes and my path is clearer

made my life a happy song

It's a joy to have your love

Little girls sleep at night
Safe inside their dreams, is it a scheme
They think they'll grow up into Queens
I am old, I am young and wise
I'm just a little girl in low cut clothes
Who hides behind a face, but really knows
That you devise what a child get for free
And I'll be viewed that way once... of me

Come on and hold me tight
Don't turn off the light
Just let your words embrace me
Like a fathers loving arms
Protect me from the night it will be alright
Cause tonight I'm just a little girl

A women is what a woman gives
Sometimes she gives too much, look but don't touch
Most times for me, there's not enough
When a man fall in love, with me
He moves into me like he would a house
He decorates me and lives his fantasies out

If you devise what a child gets for free

I DON'T GO SHOPPING (PATTI LABELLE)

I don't go shopping for love
You're something money can't buy

I dream in colors, and my dreams are only shades of you
so I'm never blue

I don't go wishing on a star
just want to be where you are
too many times it felt so right,
but it was just the nite
now I see the light

I don't care nothing 'bout going out
now that I found out what it's all about

Wish I was your child
Hold me in your heart
We could love so free
And no, we'd never part

But I'm not a child
And wishes are
Just child's play, my love
Now I'll never be afraid

Of who I am
And who I'm not
Come what may
Wish I was a bird

I remember when
I was five and you were ten, boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

Runnin' hot, runnin' cold

So low, there was nowhere to go like a bad dream

Somehow the wires uncrossed, my tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied it up my point of view
I got a new attitude!

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
I got a new attitude!

I'm wearing a new dress, new hair
Brand new ideas, as a matter of fact I've changed for good
It must have been the cool night, new moon, slight change
More than to figure oh but I feel like I should, yes

I can't sit here while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire, running out of time
There's no room in this ol' heart of mine
Bill collectors waiting down the hall
Neighbors scream and crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement, passion hits the street
Angels cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy, I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door
Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone
I've got to stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now

Something deep and true
Is what she needs from you

She loves with everything
She can touch your heart
And steal your soul
But you've got to earn her trust
To feel her touch
To be the one she's loving

New day
Pushing ahead till my goal gets nearer
New day
Spread my wings
I'm doin' things my way
It's a new day

Wasn't sure where I should begin
Couldn't tell my beginning from the end
For every door that closed a window opened
Been 'round the world and back again, it starts from within, yes

Open my eyes and my path is clearer

My gift is my song and this one's for you, yeah
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It might be quite simple but now that it's done

How wonderful life is while you're in the world, oh yeah, yeah

And my tune has been sung before

Another show is over
And the lights have gone down
There's no flowers at my door
No, no callers comin' 'round, no

But I'm glad to be alive sure enough in the land of the living
I can't believe that I survived
Still [Incomprehensible] I'm in the land of the living
Can't believe that I survived

And warm my nights like the morning sun

That should be so easy to do
Oh you better get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
What good is a love affair if we can't see eye to eye

My life has meaning now since you came
I've been changed in so many ways
You've turned my heart around nothing can bring me down
I'm feeling free and my life's a song

There's no other way to describe
What it is that your kiss does to me
You give good love to me, satisfy all my needs
You make me feel so alive

This word is all, I have to say
I love you in every way
(This word is all)
All that I have and all I can't hold back
With a feeling like that

When you are gone and this feeling comes on
I'm content all alone till you come back home
You are the one for me, I'd give you anything

Yo Mister how's your daughter
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone
My crazy friend named Cara
After all of us told her,? No?

Now she's going nowhere stoned
Her papa caught her on the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only 17
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter)
You really ought to know

Then she started skipping school
Then Cara got high top make disappear

Nerves jump off the pavement, passion hits the street
Angels cookin' in the city heat

World's too crazy, I can't take no more

Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm

Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head

So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
I got a new attitude!

I'm wearing a new dress, new hair
Brand new ideas, as a matter of fact I've changed for good
It must have been the cool night, new moon, slight change
More than to figure oh but I feel like I should, yes

Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it

I don't want to bore you, baby
Don't wanna waste your time

So I fantasize

Ooh, baby, ah

Sorry to disturb you
But I had to get this off my chest
I know you? ve been real busy
Don? t have time for emotional stress

You see, taking care of home
Means more than just the rent
It means calling now and then
On occasions dropping in
And sometimes having flowers sent

What if I stayed out late
And didn? t even call
Wasn? t there to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn? t smile
And compliment you when I should
Tell me what would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot?
Still, what would you do?

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
When there's something in the air
And the earth is shaking
Something inside me knows
One heart went falling
A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it
...

Re, re, re, re, re, re, re, re
Release yourself
Release, release
Release yourself

Every day's a new day, everyday was carved
Move in to the rhythm that's repeating in your heart
Every day's a challenge, every day we'll try
Lines got to find in toe to toe when I had you on

Re, re, re, re, re, re, re
Release yourself
Re, re, re, re, re, re, re
Release yourself

Living for tomorrow, got your dreams all laid away
Ah, there's so much pressure, you deserve a break today
(Release)
Every thing's a problem and you can't take much more
Turn up the music, get your body on the floor

Re, re, re, re, re, re, re
Release yourself

So I'm holding back
Afraid when I can't save it all

I'm saving it, your love to me
A sentimental love tonight to me
Every time it is when you love somebody

No tears, no signs
Only makes it so much harder to go on
Just take good care
And remember when you're feeling all alone

You'll be with me in my heart
And always on my mind
The only thing that keeps us apart is time

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise

Just let your words embrace me
Like a fathers loving arms
Protect me from the night it will be alright

Sometimes she gives too much, look but don't touch

He decorates me and lives his fantasies out

Somehow the wires uncrossed, my tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied it up my point of view
I got a new attitude!

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
I got a new attitude!

I'm wearing a new dress, new hair
Brand new ideas, as a matter of fact I've changed for good
It must have been the cool night, new moon, slight change
More than to figure oh but I feel like I should, yes

song we're gonna do.
The song is so sad that sometimes I have to
leave the stage and cry in the backstage a
little bit while I'm singing this song.
The reason this song is so sad because this
story happened to me just a little while ago
(not true, but true) (audience laughs)
And it was, it was a thing where I met this
this beautiful girl, right? was she a
beautiful girl as she was, she was nice and ...
and I gave her my whole heart, every every bit,
and she gave it back to me a month later all
beat up, so bad and
so terrible looking that

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star

Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believe in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

Sometime, I can't help thinking
Just what my life is for
I try to do very best that I can
Yet, I know I can do more

This life I lead is not one without its pain
That doesn't mean I should smile nothing there to gain

I can't complain
I know the sun shines through the rains
It still survives
I can't complain
Everyday is a new beginning
And this is journey of my life
Journey of my life

I've done just as I've desired
Lived on wire without a net, been so many places

Yo Mister how's your daughter
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone
My crazy friend named Cara
After all of us told her,? No?
She givin' up speed ball
Now she's going nowhere stoned
Her papa caught her on the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only 17
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter)
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone
Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then she started skipping school
Then Cara got high top make disappear

Sally snuck in the back of the church
Her skirts showing off her legs
High-heeled shoes, lipstick smeared
No money in her pocket she was too proud to beg

Raw hands gloved, said she was dirty
Sally was hurt with every word they said
"Halo queen of England" Sally was so weak
Of, oh she does her best work in bed'
Best work in bed, hey, hey, hey

Wait a minute now, Reverend James thought
He'd stress on the Bible as he screamed at everyone
I could see the tease on rock and roll music
Lord help them will they see the sun

Huh? See the sun but if the reverend could have sawn

Don't tell me you still love me
Don't make me feel this way
Don't tell me you're thinking of me
You know it's late to change

You were the one to leave
You said you did not love me
Now you're coming back right on track
Just like you always do

You can't bring me down
I have come too far this time around
You know I'll always love you

Can't bring me down
I have finally reached a higher ground

This I know is true, all my life
It's been hard for me to just let go
And to trust someone again
And oh, I will be alright, still I can't let go
So I hold too tight

And I've been hurt like you in my life
But you just go on and start again
Since you left the sun shining
I know that your heart won't break
It'll just get strong, it's a choice we made with our life

Hold on to me and we'll be stronger
Together, stronger forever
Gotta have a little faith

It came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heaven all gracious
King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall on the Prince of peace
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels

I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down

Silent night! Holy night!
All's asleep, one sole light,
Just the faithful and holy pair,
Lovely boy-child with curly hair,

Love from your holy lips shines clear,
As the dawn of salvation draws near,
Jesus, Lord, with your birth!

I must have rehearsed my lines
A thousand times
Until I had them memorized

But when I get up the nerve
To tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right

Do need you

I dream of moments we share
But you're not there

Runnin' hot, runnin' cold
I was runnin' into overload
It was extreme

I took it so high, so low
So low, there was nowhere to go
Like a bad dream

Somehow the wires uncrossed, the tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
I can't sit here while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire, running out of time
There's no room in this ol' heart of mine
Bill collectors waiting down the hall
Neighbors scream and crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement, passion hits the street
Angels cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy, I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door
Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone
I've got to stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now

When there's something in the air
And the earth is shaking
Something inside me knows
One heart went falling
A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it
...

So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you
On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married
On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

No one said it was easy

If we are one big happy family

Here is my hand to let you know
That what we dream we all can hold
Apart we are weak together we're strong

Oh, people we are writing this song
We're all living these words together forever

And learn the ways of love

Won't let you down

You said that you loved me
And hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing
And I gave it half a chance

And learned the ways of Love (learned the ways of love)

And theres so much love inside me (inside)
And all that I have I give my all to you

And at times I found the answers
To some questions that were heavy on my mind
Every fantasy ceased to be a mystery to me

I've done a lot of things that I lived to regret
But all the moves I've made were not enough
To help me forget, in solitude I find
Your kiss stays on my mind after all this time

I never stopped loving you
I only did what I had to do
Though we've been so far apart
You've kept your place in my heart
I never stopped loving you

Shared a part of me with you
