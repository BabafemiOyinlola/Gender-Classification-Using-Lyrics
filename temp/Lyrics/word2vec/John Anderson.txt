There's a little girl in our neighborhood, her name is Charlotte Johnson and she's really lookin' good. I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone. I walked over to her house and this was going on:  Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie, her Mama was in the kitchen cuttin' chicken up to fry. Her daddy was in the backyard rollin' up a garden hose, I was on the porch with Charlotte, feelin' love down to my toes... and we were Swingin', yes we were Swingin'... Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing, ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

You shouldn't wade out in deep water When you don't know how to swim He told you it was over And like a fool you followed him Into a whirlpool of emotion Spinning out of control It's killing you, but you won't let him go  Let go of the stone If you don't want to drown In the sea of heartache ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I was thinking about parking the other night We was out on a back road Me and my baby was just getting right All our systems on overload Radio blasting in the front seat Turning out the music fine We was snuggled up in the back seat Making up for lost time  Steamy windows Zero visibility Steamy windows Coming from the body heat  You can wine and dine with a man all night With good intent But there is something about ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Ever since the days of old Men would search for wealth untold They'd dig for silver and for gold And leave the empty holes  And way down south in the Everglades Where the black water rolls and the saw grass waves The eagles fly and the otters play In the land of the Seminole  So blow, blow Seminole wind Blow like you're never gonna blow again ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Bit it came a town and a cadillac to lot With a song and he was born to sing But is now we got a closer to the backstage of the opry In a little writley part way burger king  Johny is the jealous of real blue collar board Is written songs whatever star and tell And no ones after listen no ones but ever low Ten years a past and he still hanging out  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
A good Christian raising A family foundation Mom and dad who taught us Right from wrong  Even through the hard times We stayed close together That's the solid ground That made me strong  But there were places that I had to go And things I had to find I was looking for the answers To the questions in my mind But all of the answers would be found On solid ground  For a while I wandered aimlessly ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It's Friday night, baby, get ready, set, go. Gonna take you to the Krystal and a picture show. Well, the sky's the limit, there's no price too high, Baby, you're the apple of my eye.

I was in a band, we were scheduled to appear At a little roadhouse called the Get Down Here A cinder block building with a hand-painted sign Hunkered down straddling the county lines When the crowd rolled in, they were a motley mix There were truckers, bikers, drifters and locals from the sticks Each one meaner than a cougar in a cage And the biggest one swaggered right up to the stage He said, â€½We've heard everybody from David Allen Coe To Chuck Berry singing "Go Johnny go go" Got an autographed picture of Elvis on the shelf ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
