And I thank God for all of the joy in my life, But most of all, for...  Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.  Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair. "Walk beside the pony daddy, it's my first ride." "I know the cake looks funny, daddy, but I sure tried."  Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right To deserve a hug every morning, And butterfly kisses at night.

Any other mornin', you might have walked a different street; Turned a different corner, instead of bumpin' into me. You'd have never said: "Excuse me." I'd have never smiled and told you: "That's ok."  We never would have sat down in that quiet coffee shop; Traded old war stories about loves that we have lost. I'd have never got your number, Before I kissed your cheek and walked away. We wouldn't be here today.  Oh, I almost never loved you: Another place another time, I'd have missed your kiss forever, And watched you walk on by. I'd have gotten up this morning, Just another lonely fool. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
