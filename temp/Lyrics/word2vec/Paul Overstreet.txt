And Me, I was just seventeen, my very first time But I knew it was right She pulled off my baseball hat We kissed and I knew there was no looking back  By the end of May I could feel the change She pulled me close to say .  I want a summer of misbehavin' Out all night, no reservations Hittin' that river, strippin' down til the sun comes up Oh, I want a summer of love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I came home this morning with two thoughts in my head One was just how broke we got; the other is what you said How a woman can look at a man in house crumbling under bills How she can say that the seasons may change but her love never will  Through it all, through everything you were the only one When I'm wild, you're the reason why I never come undone  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I wake up and find you next to me Where I always hoped you'd be And I recall, when we were both alone Far from what we needed and where we needed to be  So tell me, tell me you love me tonight Convince me it's worth all the fighting and pain, nights full of rain Times we come home and we don't feel the same and you tell me Tell me you love me  I forget who I am without you to hold ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

We started out to walk through life hand in hand together We ran into some trouble on the highway to forever Took a turn that turned out wrong woke to find the feeling gone But I know that we'll recover if we hold onto each other.  Let's take another run at it baby, take another run at our love Let's have a little fun with it darling it don't have to be so serious Don't tell me that it's over and we can pick the pieces up Let's take another run take another run at our love.  Sometimes the mountain looks so high when you're standing at the bottom But once we've made it to the top you can't see the problem Right now it hurts a little bit but we've never been the kind to quit And I know we'll make it over we'll be rolling in the clover.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Today I met an old friend I asked about an old friend That I used to know when I knew her She said that she never sees him anymore After all the cruel things he did to her She heard through the grapevine that he didn't care She started suspecting he didn't play fair.  So she gave him enough rope to hang himself Now he's still out there swinging He's all over town he can always be found Anywhere there's a cowgirl singing. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She kept a turning that dial on the radio Hoping she could find Fats Domino But the DJ never played it no he never will I guess he never heard about Blueberry Hill We turned the radio off and we sang And went out walking in the rain.

There's a man on a corner with a cardboard sign that reads I will work for food A woman stands beside him with hungry eyes that plead Our children are hungry too Some may say I'm foolish for giving to their cause I've become a believer that heaven's helped us all  Oh there but for the grace of God go I How without compassion can we pass them by Oh it could be you it could be me the world has cast aside There but for the grace of God go I  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

We broke each other's heart last night We both were losers in a fight Did we finally cross that borderline And go a little bit too far this time.  I know I said some things that really hurt But you made me feel like I was dirt I can't hardly make things any worse And I'm already late for work So I'll leave you with my final words.

He stood looking at his father who was eighty-five years old He remembered all the ball games they played so long ago Then he put his arm around him and kissed him on the cheek He say dad it's time I told you what a friend you've been to me.  'Cause when you love someone you gotta let 'em know When you're thinking of someone you need to tell 'em so Don't know what makes us think our minds and our hearts can be read What's going without saying should be said.

Lord, I know I prayed you'd take away the loneliness I knew My wildest dreams could not conceive the work your hands would do It feels so good to fall asleep in her arms every night Leave it up to You to do things right  Lord, she sure is good at loving me I know You had a hand in this 'Cause it's been so plain to see ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
