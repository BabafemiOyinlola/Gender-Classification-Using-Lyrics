Way before the sun comes up, Already on his second cup, He's looking out across the open sky. As streaks of orange, pink, and gray Wash over rows of new mown hay The rangeland fills a cowboy's heart with pride.  He rises slowly from his chair, His back is stiff, grey's in his hair. He's spent a lot of lone days in the sun. He ain't one much to complain He saddles up, takes the reins, And rides har 'til his working day is done.  You can see it in the eyes of every woman and man Who've spent their whole lives living close to the land. There's a love for the country And a pride in the brand In America's heartland living close to the land In America's heartland close to the land.

Well they took along their running irons Maybe a dog or two, And they 'lowed thy'd brand every long-eared calf That came within their view.  Now every little long-eared dogie That didn't push up by day, Got his long ears whittled and his old hide scorched In a most artistic way.  One fine day, says Buster Jiggs, As he throws his seago down, "I'm tired of cowpiography And I think I'm a goin' into town."

Little Joe the wrangler, he'll wrangle never more His days with the remuda, they're all done It was long about last April he rode into our camp Just a little Texas stray and all alone It was long late in the evening when he rode into our camp On a little old brown pony he called Shaw In his brogan shoes and coveralls, a harder lookin' kid You never in you life have seen before.  His saddle was a Sother kack built many years ago An OK spur on one foot idly hung With his bed roll in a cotton sack was loosely tied behind And a canteen from the saddle horn he'd slung.  Said he had to leave his home because his paw had married twice His new maw beat him every day or two So he saddled up old Shaw one night and lit a shuck this way Thought he'd try and paddle now his own canoe.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

She crossed the Mississippi and she headed west A hillbilly baby in a hot pink dress She couldn't stand the slap of daddy's razor strap no more High heel shoes clicking down the street Fishnet stockings and aching feet She was bound and determined and determined not to be bound To the life of a wife in a sleepy little sawmill town  If you wantna be wild you better beware It's a dangerous world out there You roll the dice and you take your chance But you got to pay the fiddler if you want to dance ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Oh the wind blows cold on the trail of the buffalo Oh the wind blows cold in the land of the Navajo In the land of the Navajo  A hundred miles from nowhere out on the desert sand One-eyed Jack the trader held some turquoise on his hand And by his side sat Running Elk his longtime Indian friend He vowed that he would stay by Jack till the bitter end  Jack had gambled everything he owned to lead this wandering life He might have had a happy home or a tender loving wife But his hunger was for tradin' trappers' firs for turquoise stones Anything the Indians had Jack wanted for his own ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Driving West out on I-40 On my way to taste some California wine A broke down family flagged me down Near the Arizona line  Their whole world was in a pickup I guess it couldn't pull the load It was just our vacation But to them it was desperation road  The lines on their faces Told the story of the places that they'd been Now their home is a highway That never seems to end  Empty dreams and empty pockets Sure can make a heavy load ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Way before the sun comes up, Already on his second cup, He's looking out across the open sky. As streaks of orange, pink, and gray Wash over rows of new mown hay The rangeland fills a cowboy's heart with pride.  He rises slowly from his chair, His back is stiff, grey's in his hair. He's spent a lot of lone days in the sun. He ain't one much to complain He saddles up, takes the reins, And rides har 'til his working day is done.  You can see it in the eyes of every woman and man Who've spent their whole lives living close to the land. There's a love for the country And a pride in the brand In America's heartland living close to the land In America's heartland close to the land.  When the sun is high overhead She's been eight hours out of bed. She's still got a lot of work to do, ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
