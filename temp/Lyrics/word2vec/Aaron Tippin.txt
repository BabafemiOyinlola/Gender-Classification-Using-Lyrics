Hello, well, is anybody out there listenin' in Washington DC? This is the sufferin' voice of America, cryin' out for relief Now I don't know what a gallon of gas costs up on capitol hill But we sure know what it cost down here in reality-ville  And the damage already done has been a mighty heavy toll And if we're gonna fix it, we gotta start right here at home  How 'bout some oil from our own soil that belongs to us anyhow?

Now Daddy didn't like trouble But if it came along Everyone that knew him Knew which side that he'd be on He never was a hero Or this county's shinin' light But you could always find him standing up For what he thought was right  He'd say you've got to stand for something Or you'll fall for anything You've got to be your own man Not a puppet on a string Never compromise what's right And uphold your family name You've got to stand for something Or you'll fall for anything ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way: Aaron Tippin  I've walked the straight and narrow and I've worn a rebel's brand Sometimes I've had to go without for bein' my own man I've rallied to the cause when I knew the cause was right I've cut against the grain, but I've kept my peace of mind And I wouldn't have it any other way If there's a price for bein' me, that's one I'll have to pay ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Somewhere out there in the smoky air Where the night is neon blue Surrounded by strangers, she don't know the dangers One drink could lead her to And if she falls, it's all my fault For doin' a good woman wrong I can't be far behind her Oh, Lord, help me find her Before my angel is gone Looking for my blue angel ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You get up every morning 'fore the sun comes up Toss a lunchbox into a pickup truck A long, hard day sure ain't much fun But you've gotta get it started if you wanna get it done You set your mind and roll up your sleeves You're workin' on a working man's Ph.D.  With your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow You build the things that really make the world go around If it works, if it runs, if it lasts for years You bet your bottom dollar it was made right here With pride, honor and dignity ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Maybe we'll never be seen together At night on a crowded street I may never reach across your body And kill the light when you're asleep  Maybe I'll never watch you dressing Or sound too familiar on the phone But I can touch your hand that's against me And take that moment home  That's as close as I'll get to loving you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She's been staring out the window four nights in a row Like a caged up tiger, she's pacing the floor Oh, the night is young and the moon is full And she just can't resist when she feels the pull She's got a restless spirit that she can't control And when she gets like this, I gotta let her go  She hears the call of the wild every once in a while She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere She can turn it loose and howl I know what's in store, Katie bar the door When she winks at me and smiles She's in a foot stompin', honky-tonkin' Love making state of mind ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I hollered "hey honey, I'm home" like I do every day at four But the TV ain't on and the car is gone, she must be at the store Then I spied this piece of paper it looked like a list of things to do But when I got down to number six I realized we were through The plumber couldn' make it today, I've decided that I'm going away The dog's at the vet the hearing is set Do you see what I'm trying to say Don't forget to take out the trash, I'm sorry but I'm not coming back Now you can't sugar coat what she really wrote ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Way up in the sky, not a cloud is flyin' by A picture perfect afternoon Birds upon the wing, I can hear them sing Chirping out a happy tune And I'm walkin' around with my head hanging down Got a reason for feeling this way Since you've been gone things look so wrong The sky's got the blues today The sky's got the blues, just like I've got them for you ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
With every drink I take, it's gettin' harder to recall And I ain't gonna stop until I forget it all 'Cause once upon a time she used to love me so But that was many, many, many beers ago All my tin can buddies that help me ease the pain One by one they remind me she's not coming back again Just how long she's been gone I can't say I really know ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It's taken me some time to read the writing on the wall But I have finaly figured out just what's been going on And I need to tell you what I've learned before you turn to go There's things about that other man I think you should know The man that came between us was looking out for number one He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done But looking in the mirror, today, I finally came to see That man that came between us was me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors Left a note there with the keys if it cranks, well friend, she's yours And I struck out across Texas, gonna walk it line to line Now I'm halfway cross New Mexico, but you're still on my mind And this road that's going nowhere just leads me on and on As I ask myself with every step will I ever be alone I wonder just how far it is over you Is there no place I go that you don't come too When I left Tennessee, I thought we were through ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

(aaron tippin/charlie craig/mark collie)  I used to smoke and stay out late Sometimes I drank more that I ate I used to think, man, I was bad Why, I'd fight at the drop of a hat I took a walk on the wild side I guess I'm lucky that I survived I had some days I can't forget And sometimes at night I think about 'em yet I miss misbehavin' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Just a skinny little Mississippi railroad man That loved to sing and play He brought his music from the cotton fields To the the hillbilly hall of fame Thank God for Jimmie Rodgers Chisel his name in the cornerstone I just wish he could've lived to see the day When country took the throne Now a million songs have come and gone Since we made that humble start About neon nights, everyday life Love and broken hearts And more and more folks Kept tuning in and turning on Now I can proudly say that I saw the day ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
