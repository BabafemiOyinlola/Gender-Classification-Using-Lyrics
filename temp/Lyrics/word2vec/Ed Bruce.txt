This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost  He rides a feed lot and clerks in a market On weekends selling tobacco and beer His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here  He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark And eyeball to eyeball Ol' Wyatt backed down He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Oh there were others and some were friends And some were merrily lovers But they all helped me discover It's so hard to find someone who'll be true  And I said no way, would I fall again oh no, no way There's just too many heartaches And I don't like the way it feels to feel my heart break Then there was you  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

There's a parking lot where the corner cafe stood One of the places we first fell in love They've built a waterslide on the bluff by the riverside Where we first fumbled our way into love And you hardly ever hear it it's a golden oldie now But you and I danced to it at least a thousand miles ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
There was only me and her and him The bar was giving last call so I thought I'd move on in And I was slick and feeling like a man so I took the stool between 'em And ordered one more round for me and her and him I placed my arms across the back of her barstool And I don't remember what I said but at the time it sounded cool She pushed her drink away and never looked at me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such  Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys 'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone Even with someone they love  A cowboy ain't easy to love and he's harder to hold It means more to him to give you a song than silver or gold Big trophy buckles and soft faded Levi's And each night begins a new day If you can't understand him and he don't die young He'll probably just ride away  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I stole her from Emmett Fry, and now what's done is done. Like any man I'm afraid to die, but I'm hurt too bad to run. I ran with her to Walker's Woods with him close on my heels; I knew he'd kill to get her back, and I know just how he feels.  Oh, the sun never shines in Walker's Woods; I doubt if it would want to come in even if it could, 'Cause the gators and the cottonmouths, the sand that pulls you down Makes Walker's Woods a haven for the damned.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Oh Lord if I could just go home I'd do things different from now on There wouldn't be near the gray in my old daddy's hair Oh Lord if I could just go home  I know it wasn't daddy's fault that mama died when I was just a kid And the best that he could do to raise me right was all he ever did And I know he'd love mama a lot longer than I had and he was every bit as alone But I don't guess I'd helped too much to build a happy home He made sure I got to church every Sunday the way mama had always done ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I met her sadly in the slowly falling rain Crying softly in her loneliness and pain Knowing no one needin' someone bad as me And she told me as I held her trembling hand Walking slowly how she'd never known a man Living lonely in her cottage by the sea When the morning came her tears had changed to laughter And before the night her heart beat close to mine ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
