I've come down this road before, I have tried to be what I'm not, I was alone you were my man, But my restless heart, made me say goodbye.  When you find yourself someone, and when you're standing there, With the lady you will love, I wish you well.

Maybe I'm not made for love, all I can do is pray.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Ooh, ooh it's party time It's time to get you off my mind Forget the life I left behind And all those dreams that won't come true  Ooh, ooh its party time It's time for laugh and pass the wine It's early and I'm feelin' fine, I'll soon be over you  Darlin' ever since the day Yes it's time to go our separate ways I've been searchin' for a way to be For doing you so wrong  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She's was going to pieces, he walked in the door She just had to see him, she can't wait no more Tonight he'll be with her no matter the cost As the band plays the Last Cheater's Waltz  He tells her he loves her as the music plays on ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I come home late at night with my shoes in my hands Stumble in the back door being quite as I can And I know she there in bed cold and all alone And she's crying cause I'm breaking up our home  And she knows (and she knows) the hell I'm going through In this world (in this world) inside my head There's a devil (there's a devil) in a bottle ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I've seen this world From corner to corner There ain't much ground That I haven't covered  I've drank its wine I've tasted its pleasures I've known some love And I've known some lovers  If there's one lesson In the livin' I've done The best things only come Along in numbers of one  There's only one Eiffel Tower One finest hour One New York town One 5th Avenue  There's only one Mona Lisa ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I've known some painted ladies that sparkled in the light Country girls that loved the lovers moon Some I never really knew, though I always wanted to Some I only met once in a room  Some said they liked my smile, others of 'em stayed a while While others left me on the run This is the only way, only way I have to say I loved 'em every one  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It was july hot in georgia in 1942 all the men were off to war and the woman had nothing to do. i was sixteen and hungry looking for my first taste of love, when i brought the groceries to the door i didn't know how close i was. her long blond hair was flowing and she smelled like sweet perfume. when i laid her groceries down she said you don't have to leave so soon. a woman sure gets lonely when a men gone off to fight. she reached up for my trembling hand as tear drops filled her eyes then she said. Chores: ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
It was the hottest day of August All of us were down by the banks of the Paint Rock River I was next in line to be baptized at the innocent age of ten And Ill never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure water And that preachers words still fill my head and I hear them now and then  He said, Do you wanna go to heaven?" And I said, "Yeah, just lead me on" Take my hand, can you feel that feelin?

We got smooth sailin', sailin' Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone Smooth sailin', sailin' And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on  We didn't break apart in stormy weather We didn't run aground like others do Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather We got the kind of love to see us through  We got smooth sailin', sailin' Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone Smooth sailin', sailin' ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her And the way she moves, just the way she moves Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn Keep me on a slow burn In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor She's more woman than I could ever ask for Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

He said, "I'm sorry I have to cancel the plans we made I got a weekend business trip bound to LA" She drives him to the airport  And watches till he boards the plane Then she hurries to a phone booth And across town the telephone rings  She's got one for the money Two for the show One to pay for the credit cards And two to rock 'n roll  One gave her the wedding ring The new car that she drives But two gives her the feeling she needs That one's money can't buy  Now she arrives at the honky tonk Just a little bit late Parks her Mercedes 'round back 'Cause her name's on the license plate ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
