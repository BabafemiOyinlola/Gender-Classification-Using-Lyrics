On Oct. 31st 1941 the United States destroyer Reuben James, sailing in the waters west of Iceland, was attacked torpedoed and sunk without warning.  95 lives were lost in this 1st U.S. warship to go down in the 2nd World War.  What were their names tell me what were their names? Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?  Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James? Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and of fame. She flew the Stars and Stripes for the land of the free, but tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Kristofferson: Sherry was a waitress, At the only joint in town. She had a reputation, As a girl who'd been around. Down Main Street after midnight, With a brand new pack of cigs. A fresh one hanging from her lips, A beer between her legs. She'd ride down to the river, And meet with all her friends. All 4: The road goes on forever And the party never ends  Nelson: Sonny was a loner, Bolder than the rest. He was goin' in the Navy, But he couldn't pass the test.

And the party never ends.  Jennings: Sonny's playin' eight ball, At the joint where Sherry works. Some drunken out-of-towner, Put his hand up Sherry's skirt. Sonny took his pool cue, Laid the drunk out on the floor. Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar, Walked out of the door.

There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me, And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be.

A fresh one hanging from her lips, A beer between her legs. She'd ride down to the river, And meet with all her friends. All 4: The road goes on forever And the party never ends  Nelson: Sonny was a loner, Bolder than the rest. He was goin' in the Navy, But he couldn't pass the test.

And the party never ends.  Jennings: Sonny's playin' eight ball, At the joint where Sherry works. Some drunken out-of-towner, Put his hand up Sherry's skirt.

On Oct. 31st 1941 the United States destroyer Reuben James, sailing in the waters west of Iceland, was attacked torpedoed and sunk without warning.  95 lives were lost in this 1st U.S. warship to go down in the 2nd World War.

A fresh one hanging from her lips, A beer between her legs. She'd ride down to the river, And meet with all her friends. All 4: The road goes on forever And the party never ends  Nelson: Sonny was a loner, Bolder than the rest. He was goin' in the Navy, But he couldn't pass the test. So he hung around town, And he sold a little pot. The law got wind of Sonny, And one day he got caught. But he was back in business, When they set him free again. All 4: The road goes on forever. And the party never ends.  Jennings: Sonny's playin' eight ball, At the joint where Sherry works. Some drunken out-of-towner, Put his hand up Sherry's skirt. Sonny took his pool cue, Laid the drunk out on the floor. Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar, Walked out of the door.

Willie Nelson: I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five But I am still alive.

(Nelson, 1st line; Kristofferson, 2nd line; Jennings, 3rd line; Cash 4th line) I taught the weepin' willow how to cry, cry, cry And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky And the tears I cried for that woman, are gonna flood you, big river And I'm gonna sit right here until I die  (Willie Nelson) I met her accidentally in St. Paul Minnesota, And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, southern drawl Then I heard my dream went back downstream cavortin' in Davenport, And I followed you, big river, when she called.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Kristofferson) I played the Red River Valley And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry An' run his fingers through 70 years of livin' An' wonder Lord, as ever, will that drill run dry?

The end of a hundred year waltz. The voices sound sad as they're singin' along. Another piece of America's lost.  He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets, On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer. And his dream's of tomorrow, surrounded by fences, But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here.  He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark, And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Cash:) When his stolen gold has turned to rust, He rides off in a cloud of dust, Lookin' for a border he can cross. She'll stand by and watch him go, Wonderin' if he'll ever know, The hurt she's feelin' now, and what they've lost.  (Jennings lead, the Highwaymen & backup singers:) Angels love bad men. That's how it's always been. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Willie Nelson: There's a young man in town, Slip-slidin' around. He likes to roll free and easy. There's only his way, He calls all the plays. And he lives on his island alone.

Worth more than gold To only be sold. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Hey babe, do you remember, back in 1969? We gathered round the room, you sang yours and I sang mine We took turns with the guitar, in the front and center seat Shel and Kris and Dylan, and a couple off the street  Joni Mitchell cried on, "Both Sides Now" We sang songs that made a difference and we can again somehow Everybody knew that this was quite a special night Graeme Nash was nervous in the hot seat, in the light ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto line, The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry. I was riding on a folk coach and everything was fine, 'Til we took a shorter road to save some time. The bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest. They may have wounded me but they'll never get the best, Of better men: 'Cos I'll ride again.  I am a river gambler, I make a livin' dealin' cards. My clothes are smooth and honest, my heart is cold and hard. I was shufflin' for some delta boys on a boat for New Orleans, I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen. But the Captain bumped a sandbar, and an ace fell from my sleeve. They threw me overboard as I swore I didn't cheat, But I could swim: And I'll ride again. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
