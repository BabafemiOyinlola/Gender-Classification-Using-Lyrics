Sir, if you don't mind I'd rather be alone From the moment I walked in tonight, you've been comin' on If I've told you once, I've told you twice, I'm just here to unwind I'm not interested in romance or what you have in mind  What part of no don't you understand? To put it plain and simple I'm not into one night stands I'll be glad to explain it if it's too hard to comprehend ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I've been living with a heart on the mend, wondering how will I ever be strong. I know I'll live to love again. I just leaned on you too long. It's been an uphill fight, but I'm going to be alright.  I didn't know my own strength till I had to pick myself up and carry on without your love. I'm getting back on my feet. Its been a long hard fall, but I'll make it after all ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

You look so disbelieving At my suitcase by the door My taxi's on its' way I can't take it anymore  Lately you've forgotten What loving me is about Well, now you've got five minutes To figure it out  You've got five minutes To tell me what I've needed to hear You've got five minutes To show me that your really sincere That's not much time to change my mind It'll take a miracle no doubt And you've got five minutes To figure it out ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

There's so much breakin' up Folks who won't fall in love Put up shelves, guard themselves Build walls  And it makes me cry sometimes 'Cause people live lonely lives They don't want to try They don't want to live at all  But I'm not gonna be afraid To give up my heart that way 'Cause I need you I need you by my side ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Lost touch with my soul I had nowhere to turn, I had nowhere to go Lost sight of my dream Thought it would be the end of me  I thought I'd never make it through I had no hope to hold on to I, I thought I would break  I didn't know my own strength And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble I got through all the pain I didn't know my own strength  Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive I picked myself back up, hold my head up high I was not built to break I didn't know my own strength ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I wouldn't know what to say I wouldn't know what to do If you came back from Heaven And I could look at you Would I fumble for the words Would I be a little shy Would I bust right out with laughter Or break right down and cry Oh, if you came back from Heaven Would it be like it was then Could we just pick up where we left off And try it all again Oh, if you came back from Heaven It would freeze me in my tracks And I hope God knows, if He let you go I'd never send you back ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I sit there talking to myself, why can't he turn it down? He keeps that TV up so loud that I can't think And every time I turn a page he starts to talk about his day Can't he see I'm trying to read  And it's cold enough in here to freeze, he keeps it 68 degrees What's that man been thinking of? In all the years we've been together You'd think he'd know me better than he does  I sit there wondering to myself, why he wears the same old clothes ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
