She was the prom queen, the world was hers With a wave of her hand, whispered words Hearts broken by her abilities Addicted to the sweetness of a gentle kiss Lost in a search for something she might never find Never know if she don't try, the results will come in time No time to smell the roses, let alone slow dance Too many bad memories of forgotten romance She walked out slammed the door Damn him, she didn't need him A child game she had to cloth him feed him Alone after so long gave up hope Convinced all men were abusive Undependable heathens and sold dope Mister right wasn't coming A fact that she would have to face She didn't have no time to waste, she had a man to raise No man to chase, sick of living in this blasted place No time to sit around weeping like a basket case Her son made it all worthwhile The only man that got to see her smile She reminisced about her lifestyle before the baby came She did what responsible people do, she changed  She's a different kinda lady She's not often understood She's a different kinda lady ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Love grows best, in houses just like this.  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Bobby was a beautiful girl From a small town in a great big world Her daddy owned the corner store Off of 7th Ave.  Danny-Jo just turned 19 Cigarettes rolled under his sleeve His leather jacket and his faded jeans And a bad attitude  But it's hard to be tough When you're falling in love  (chorus) And he said: I know I'm down on my knees But I wanna be the one your only one I'm beggin' you please And I know that I don't have that much But for whatever I don't have I'll make up in love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
When we met, I told her I'd give her the moon and I did on a silver spoon If I'd only known the promise I kept would be wrong Well she might not be gone Now it's easy to see The only thing she needed from me  Chorus Was more love, more time More of her knowing that she's on my mind More of her heart would have suited her fine Cause that's what she was dreaming of ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
He sends her roses and lines he composes things a lady loves. Well he's there to hold her when she needs a shoulder if life gets too rough Oh now that she's left I keep kicking myself whenever I start thinking back He says he needs her, tells her he loves her, why didn't I think of that?  When she gets down Well he's always around her, he makes her smile again. He mends her heartaches, remembers her birthday, and tries to be a friend. Now that she's gone I know what I did wrong, it's all so simple in fact. Well he says he wants her, can't live without her, ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I Was Headed Noth On Highway Five, One Star Lit Sunday Night When A Pickup Truck Flew By Me Out Of Control As I Watched In My Headlights He Swerved Left And Then Back Right He Never Hit The Brakes As He Left The Road  I Found Him Lying In The Grass Among The Steel And Glass With An Empty Whiskey Bottle By His Side Through The Blood And Tears He Whispered In My Ear ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Once I promised, I'd do anything to please you. And looking back you must admit I've tried. Now you stand there, and tell me I must leave you. But I can't go, Well I guess I must have lied.

After three good years together We had our first big fight So she went to her mother's And I went for a drive  Down an old familiar highway Just a few miles out of town To that run down, one room tavern That used to be my stompin' ground  Well I pulled in the driveway You know it all still looked the same And I couldn't wait to down a few And hear that jukebox strain  But as I walked in through the doorway Well there stood some kind of matra'd Well he looked me up and he looked me ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Verse 1: Every morning I watch you Walk into the office In your business suit And matching shoes With your hair pulled up neatly You tug at your glasses And you sit down Just three desks down And I watch you in the florescent glare And my mind drifts away somewhere And I see  Chours: You In a different light Your hair falling down With love in your eyes In my mind ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
I said the night you left me, Nothin' worse could ever happen, But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong. And when your eyes met mine, I knew that you were gone forever, Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on. I'd be better off in a pine box, On a slow train back to Georgia, Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time. I think I'd rather die, And go to hell and face the devil, Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Eighty hours a week, that's what I call work And this black under my blue collar is his best pay dirt They work me hard from dawn to dusk Doin' double time puttin' out sweat for a filthy buck  F.I.C.A. and the state They make my paycheck look like a big mistake Taxman takes his before I see a cent And what they don't get, I've already spent  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

If I had taken the time To write down a few lines Everytime that you crossed this heart of mine I'd put them all in a book How much time would that have took The words and years have a way of slipping back  Oh no!

I called your name out loud To a stranger yesterday When she turned around I said "I'm sorry" and just walked away From a distance she had that look And for a second or two  I thought it was you It took a moment to catch my breath Tried to brace myself Still don't have a clue How to leave your mem'ry behind After all this time ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Well, I've had all the time I need to wonder, Just how much I miss her being gone. And I'm already wishing she was close enough to hold, An' her memory's only fourteen minutes old.

There's still some coffee in her cup, and its not even cold. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
