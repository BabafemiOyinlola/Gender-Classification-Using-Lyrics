Wade Hayes Miscellaneous The Day That She Left Tulsa (Mark D. Sanders/Steve Diamond)  We were a half mile high on the Ferris wheel At our old county fair I didn't even know we had trouble until She told me way up there That's when my life started spinning round My world came crashing to the ground The day that she left Tulsa  In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Don't make me come to Tulsa You know I hate to fly I ain't been back to Oklahoma baby Since you said goodbye  I heard a rumor you missed me I hope to God it's a lie You know how much I love you Don't make me come to Tulsa  You had me eating right out of your hand I was your genuine cowboy man You threw me over for another guy I ran Dallas on a one way flight Now I'm accustomed to the shape I'm in ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
(Chick Rains/Wade Hayes)  I'm sittin' here surrounded by people I know The beer's cold and the music's good and loud That used to be enough to put a smile on my face But tonight I just feel lost in this crowd  There's a brunette on the dance floor That smiled a time or two So I got up and asked her for a dance But when she put her arms around me And I held her I knew ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Neon lights draw me like a moth to a flame  Mama raised me right That just leaves me to blame When i get a little sideways on a honky-tonk tear I'm Old Enough To Know Better But i'm still too young to care Cowgirls with an attitude  Boots and tight blue jeans Take my mind off doin' right, and doin' other things When the weekend's gone I won't have a dime to spare I'm Old Enough To Know Better But i'm still too young to care ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

(Wade Hayes/Chick Rains)  I was born in Oklahoma in 1969 My daddy played the honky tonks Out on the county line One night he took me with him Through those swingin' doors And I heard that country music Saw that crowded dance floor Dad made fifty dollars And I stayed up 'til three And I thought This is the life for me  By the time I turned fourteen I was pickin' lead guitar Everyday I went to school And at night I played the bars Two or three years later I noticed something strange ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I haven't had a good night's sleep in weeks, now thanks to you The ghost of broken promises you made, haunts every room A hurtin' heart can't get no rest 'round here I lie awake and wonder how your conscience could be clear  How do you sleep at night?

Do you see me when you close your eyes? ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
