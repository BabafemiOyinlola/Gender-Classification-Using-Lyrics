I know you're out there somewhere 'Cause I've held you in my dreams And I'm waitin' for the day it all comes true So close and yet so far away You'll be more than just a dream some day I'll hold you in my arms but 'till I do  Chorus: ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
