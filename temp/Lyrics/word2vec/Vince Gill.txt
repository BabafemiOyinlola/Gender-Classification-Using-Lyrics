She thinks I'm gonna miss her Someone tell her that she's wrong I'm goin' back to Oklahoma boys 'Cause that's where I belong.  I need one good ride I'll be satisfied Come on Oklahoma borderline If we roll all night she'll be coming into sight Come on Oklahoma borderline.  Well, now I don't need no Texas girl ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
