I can see the pain living in your eyes And I know how hard you try You deserve to have so much more I can feel your heart and I sympathize And I'll never criticize all you've ever meant to my life  I don't want to let you down I don't want to lead you on I don't want to hold you back From where you might belong  You would never ask me why My heart is so disguised I just can't live a lie anymore ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
You know this old world is full of singers But just a few are chosen To tear your heart out when they sing Imagine life without them All your, radio heros Like the outlaw that walks through Jesse's dream  No, there will never be another Red-headed stranger A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues The Okie from Muskogee Or Hello Darling Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes  Who's gonna fill their shoes ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Not too many years ago When dreams was coming true I'd reach for inspiration Sometimes it would be you I'd hear you on the radio I sure did like your sound Say it's good to know there's still A few ol' country boys around  From the smoke it's hard to tell What's coming down the line We heard you were a fast train ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange He asked a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes "Get a job, you fuckin' slob"'s all he replied  God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues Then you really might know what it's like Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love He said, "Don't worry about a thing, baby doll, I'm the man you've been dreamin' of." But three months later he said he won't date her or return her call And she sweared, "God damn if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls." And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door. They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore  God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose Then you really might know what it's like I've seen a rich man beg I've seen a good man sin I've seen a tough man cry  I've seen a loser win And a sad man grin ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
