Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine. She heard his voice on the other end of the line; She wondered what was wrong this time. She never knew what his calls might bring. With a cowboy like him it could be anything. And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind.  He said, It's cold out here, and I'm all alone. I didn't make the short go again and I'm comin' home. I know I've been away too long. I never got a chance to write or call. I know this rodeo has been hard on us all.
