The alarm clock ting-a-ling ringin' in my head I woke up dog tired, beat down, half dead Tryin' to recover from another wild weekend Chuggin' down coffee when I shoulda been sleepin'  Well, it sure is Monday Isn't it now I gotta get myself through the week somehow I had a ball Friday, Saturday, and Sunday ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

When the lights go out And the crowd goes away, We tear it down and load it up And get on down the highway. And I'll grab a beer and my old guitar And go to the back and sing my favorite song To myself, when the lights go out.  Tomorrow night's in Denver, And out Tucson after that. Maybe one more show but I don't know, Yeah, we might be headin' back. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

This Side Of The Door (Tim Mensy/Shawn Camp)  Door knob in one hand Suitcase in the other And I don't love you rollin' off her tongue Words ripped right through me Tore a hole in my heart Could've hurt me a lot less with a gun She nearly knocked the wall down, Slammin' that ol' door Now the silence is more deadly Than the violence of the storm.

Well, it sure feels good to come in here And just pull up a seat A frosty mug of a cool one Helps to beat the heat These old dog days of summer Lord, I'll be glad when they're gone It's too hot to fish and too hot for golf And too cold at home  Well, that baseball game on TV Takes me back to when I was a kid We proudly wore those uniforms Just like the Dodgers did ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)
Brother jukebox, sister wine. Mother freedom, father of time. Since she left me by myself You're the only family I've got left.  I go down to that same old cafe Where I try to wash my troubles away.

We were all down at Margies bar Tellin' stories if we had one Someone fired the old jukebox up The song it sure was a sad one A teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose From the pain the song was inflictin' And all at once he jumped to his feet Just like somebody kicked him  Bubba shot the jukebox last night Said it played a sad song, it made him cry Went to his truck and got a 45 Bubba shot the jukebox last night  Bubba ain't never been accused Of bein' mentally stable So we did not draw an easy breath Til he laid that Colt on the table ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

Last night I came home again Three sheets to the wind And broke the promise I swore I'd never break.  And it came as no surprise To see the hurt in her eyes Or the Bible on the table where she prayed This time I thought for sure that she was good as gone But she just wiped the tears away and put some coffee on.
