We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie, An say: "Uh, uh: Looks just right."  Tracy: Chorus: Well, that's the truth about men. Yeah, that's the truth about us. We like to hunt and golf on our days off, Scratch, an' spit, an cuss. It don't matter what line we hand you, When we come draggin' in. We ain't wrong; we ain't sorry, An' it's probably gonna happen again.   Tracy: We hate watchin' "Steel Magnolias".

Well it's Friday evening, six o'clock And all my friends are twisting off I'm at the house just turning on TV And they all wonder why I've changed How many times must I explain It's basic honky-tonk anatomy  The drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone  ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

I grew up in a tiny town. Sidewalks rolled up when the sun went down, and we played in the streets 'till my mom said come in, in that tiny town.  My dad ran a station by the railroad track. Half his life spent on his back underneath a car Lord he worked so hard in that tiny town.  They say home is where your heart is And I guess it's true. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618341378)

(Michael P.

Grabbed my favorite CDs and my six pack of beer A duffle bag full of my clothes Didn't come here with much even leaving with less Guess that's what you get when ya go.
