Be careful how you treat my love
Don't you know good love is hard to find
Be careful how you use my love
Just be kind to this heart of mine

Darling, you've been careless
For the past few months
It's time you realized
How much you stand to lose

Love don't grow on trees
You should have learned by now
Once you find real love
Never, never let it go

Candy dreams inside my mind

A trip on a star, love keeps growing
Summer kiss, it's nice of knowing
You're here with me, so happy to be this way

Every word I say is true
I'm so in love, I'm so in love with you [So in love with you]

'Cause I'm falling [Falling] under your spell tonight

Hold on tight, don't turn out the light

With all of my might I'll try to make things right
Can't we fall in love again?

Oh, babe, I thought I couldn't live without you, baby

Someone worth your down
Anything that time might change you will eventually
Swear that love will never be sincere
Given all just alf a chance, keep an open heart
You can't be happy the way you are

You should let somebody love you
Let a true love find you
Let omebody loe you,

And the hungry night is begging to be fed

I guess what is most secure is bound to lose

A girl from Tennessee meets a boy that could be
The link to what has been missing
He was from the south and we knew all about
The art of loving and kissing
It was late one night, no one thought it was right
He left my life in disaster
Now those days are gone, but I'll keep holding on
Hoping to bring back the laughter

Since he went away to this very day
I still cry myself to sleep at night
Any fool should know that I can't let go

Here I am again

Trust is a hard thing
To come by these days
You build me up

Got me spinning around

[Chorus:]
Just one thing on my mind
A magical ride on a sweet sensation
Love can be so fine and I got the time
Honey, let's not waste it

Some ladies would tease you

I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't want to lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain
Though we may change

Who do you think you are?
Who do you want to be?
You're the only one that really knows
Maybe you'll be surprised
After your search is through
Then you'll find you'll find you've just been chasing you
Believe me I understand
The visions of your mind
But I'm so afraid that the man you find may not need a girl like me

I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain

I was just a rider on the storm
I needed love to keep me feeling warm
I was hanging around with nothing else to do
Its about time that I found something new
The answer boy is you

Where have you been all my life?
I was nothing I was nowhere till you came and made it right
No I didnt stand a chance till I found this sweet romance
The answer boy is you are the answer boy is you

When you touch me theres something deep inside

In the middle of my life I had nothing to lose
No one to love now it's you I'm thinking of
You're a little of heaven to me
You're all I need it's my concern

I thought I had the whole world at my feet
Now I know
That I was dreaming
I fooled around and lost the only one made for me

But when you smiled you took my heart with you
Oh what a moment to feel your hand in mine

You touched my life in such a special way

I miss the way you ran your fingers through my hair

I ain't asking for your love
You've got to give it to me freely

It ain't like that
Wish it was
Yes, I want you
Want you real bad
It ain't something that I never never had

I ain't asking for your love
You've got to give it to me freely
I ain't asking for your love
You've got to give it to me freely

As you can see
And what I feel

We were known as the great lovers
We had that magic from the start
We had so much to give each other, ooh babe
But now you're telling me
You lost the spark
Hold on tight
Don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again
With all of my mind
I'll try to make things right
Can't we fall in love again

Here comes the night
If I could be in the light of you
I would not be thinkin' about you
Here comes the rain
I don't know how to explain to you
What it feels like living without you

Isn't it sad
When you think we had the love
Too good to last
It burned too hot, too fast
Too good to last

Love's cool and sweet
I said, no, don't you fake it
Love is flowing free

But it's no surprise to me
The touch of your love is everything
Come and supply my needs
Just let me show you the real thing

Baby, tonight--
Oh darlin' you and me
Tonight--
Let it be

La... La... La...
La, la, la, la... La, la...

You... led me to love again
You..., you must have known by then
Your dream would start to take you far away from me
And love was less important than your dream
You're finally found success
I saw you even less
Those midnight calls from concert halls
Increased my loneliness

Now I'm just another face in the crowd
Calling for you to take your bow
And I'm just another face in the crowd
Crying inside, cheering out loud
For you

You..., you were the very best

Does she treat you right or leave you lonely
Does she make you feel the way I do
Hanging on to yesterdays
Trying to find the best of ways to let you know
Never let you go
If you ever change your mind I'll be standing here
I am never far behind
Love is near
Does she see the stranger hiding in your heart
Does she know you still belong me
She could never give as much
How could you forget the touch that we once knew
It's up to you
If you ever change your mind I'll be standing here

In between the heartaches
You hold me here in your arms
And say you love me
In between the heartaches
The way you kiss I can tell
You're thinking of me
I know you love me
And that makes up for
All of the heartaches
And the sadness
And the tears
Everyone keeps asking me why
I stay with you
The way you hurt me
They can see
How many times
I'm alone and blue when you desert me
Oh you come and go
Without a reason

I'll never say never again
There's no way to know the ways of love

My heart was crazy
Don't let go
There was danger in your eyes
Was I fallen into hell or paradise?

I'll never say never again

In the middle of my life I had nothing to lose
No one to love now it's you I'm thinking of
You're a little of heaven to me
You're all I need it's my concern
There's a lesson to be learned
I thought I had the whole world at my feet
Now I know
That I was dreaming
I fooled around and lost the only one made for me

True love so hard to hold to
Lost in a love affair
How could you let her control you
Did I hear you say
"We'd work it out some way"?

Sweet dreams and times of laughter
We could've have it all
But my dreams are all that she's after
Wish that it would
Say I misunderstood some way

I got to leave you
But love don't wanna let love get away [Get Away]
Some way [Some way, some way]
I don't wanna lose you,
But I'm not gonna let you get away [Get Away]

Trust is a hard thing
To come by these days
You build me up

Living in confusion
Confusion, confusion

Do you grin when you bite?
Jump off, and you'll see
Ooh...

Did you know where you've been?
I got a hunk every day
Is a pleasure of sin?
Gonna make you my prey
Can you tell when you win?

Someone worth your down
Anything that time might change you will eventually
Swear that love will never be sincere
Given all just alf a chance, keep an open heart
You can't be happy the way you are

You should let somebody love you
Let a true love find you
Let omebody loe you,
It's not too hard to do if you try
Ooo, if you try

A girl from Tennessee meets a boy that could be
The link to what has been missing
He was from the south and we knew all about
The art of loving and kissing
It was late one night, no one thought it was right
He left my life in disaster
Now those days are gone, but I'll keep holding on
Hoping to bring back the laughter

Since he went away to this very day
I still cry myself to sleep at night

You, you've got nothing to lose
No, you'll leave that to me
You, you do whatever you choose
It's so nice to be free

It's your move, it's your game
But it's my heart
It's your move, it's your game
But it's my heart

Hey! You wanna ride?
(purrs)

Riding the tiger
Mess with me, you'll fall in love
I said that you're riding the tiger
Are you red enough? (Are you red enough?)
Are you red enough?

Said, don't riding the tiger
Mess with me, you'll fall in love, baby
Riding the tiger
Are you red enough? (Are you red enough?)
Are you red enough?

Do you burn in the night?
Ahh, don't tangle with me
Could you put up a fight?
I'm not afraid to be free
Do you grin when you bite?
Jump off, and you'll see
Ooh...

Did you know where you've been?
I got a hunk every day
Is a pleasure of sin?
Gonna make you my prey
Can you tell when you win?
I don't let nothing stand in my way
Ha, ha! Whoo!

Sometimes it said love it taste so sweet
May knock you off your feet
If you can't stand the heat,
I said to get off my back, oh!

Darling, you've been careless
For the past few months

Living inside your love makes me feel alright

I was just a rider on the storm
I needed love to keep me feeling warm
I was hanging around with nothing else to do
Its about time that I found something new
The answer boy is you

Where have you been all my life?
I was nothing I was nowhere till you came and made it right
No I didnt stand a chance till I found this sweet romance
The answer boy is you are the answer boy is you

When you touch me theres something deep inside

No one to love now it's you I'm thinking of
You're a little of heaven to me
You're all I need it's my concern
There's a lesson to be learned

Now I know
That I was dreaming
I fooled around and lost the only one made for me
And now I'm sorry, oh so sorry

I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my

Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine

But in my heart you came and I close the door
And now I see that "sorry girl" look in your eyes
I know she's back in town again, don't bring her back in our lives

Don't tell me, tell her It's over , it's over
Don't tell me, tell her It's over , it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
It's o---ver--- Oooh.

Whenever you call,
Ain't I the one who always takes the time to be with you, be with you?
Whenever you fall,
Ain't I the one who always been right there to pick you up
and turn your grey skies blue?

You been lost inside yourself left your feelings on the shelf
For so long second nature now
You're afraid of promises
You never let a stranger in your wondering arms
Someone worth your down
Anything that time might change you will eventually
Swear that love will never be sincere
Given all just alf a chance, keep an open heart
You can't be happy the way you are

You should let somebody love you
Let a true love find you
Let omebody loe you,
It's not too hard to do if you try
Ooo, if you try

A girl from Tennessee meets a boy that could be
The link to what has been missing
He was from the south and we knew all about
The art of loving and kissing
It was late one night, no one thought it was right
He left my life in disaster
Now those days are gone, but I'll keep holding on
Hoping to bring back the laughter

Since he went away to this very day
I still cry myself to sleep at night

Looking at the night sky as it falls upon the city
Somewhere, there's a bright light burning out across the distance
This should not have happened, I was there but where were you?
If only I knew, if only I knew

You're my falling star, I wish you were here with me
You're my falling star, I'm gonna give you everything
You're my falling star, I will lift you up and make you see

I believed in you
I thought you could do no wrong
Until I saw one day
That you were stringing me along
Played me for a fool
You used me once too much
I'm in so much pain
Here I am again

Trust is a hard thing
To come by these days
You build me up
To let down
Got me spinning around
I wish I knew
Where you were coming from
You told me you loved me
I thought I was your only one

Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion
Confusion, confusion

I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain
Though we may change

Who do you think you are?
Who do you want to be?
You're the only one that really knows
Maybe you'll be surprised
After your search is through
Then you'll find you'll find you've just been chasing you
Believe me I understand
The visions of your mind
But I'm so afraid that the man you find may not need a girl like me

I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain

the years, the tears, the laughter, things we used to do
are memories that warm me like a sunny day
you touched my life in such a special way
I miss the way youd run your fingers through my hair
those cozy nights we cuddled in your easy chair
oh, no, i wont let foolish pride turn you away
ill take you back whatever price i pay

its so nice to feel you hold me again
no, it doesnt matter where you have been
my heart welcomes you back home again

And we shared this apartment together just us two
I think of how we planned to get married
Saying love how I used to know you well

Whoa oh I can't stand this living all alone
Whoa oh I can't stand this living all alone
Oh no no no whoa

Now today I'm a woman on my own

I can feel the danger
As you light that cigarette
Watchin' you move in closer
This could be a night I might regret

I'm keepin' my options open
'Cause now we're dancin' slow
And deep inside there's a voice
Tellin' me I better go

But you sure look good to me tonight
It feels so good to me, so right
I can't take my eyes away from your little boy smile
You look so good to me, I'm gonna stay awhile

Can't we fall in love again

Paint a rainbow in your favorite shade

You..., you must have known by then
Your dream would start to take you far away from me
And love was less important than your dream
You're finally found success
I saw you even less
Those midnight calls from concert halls
Increased my loneliness

Now I'm just another face in the crowd
Calling for you to take your bow
And I'm just another face in the crowd
Crying inside, cheering out loud
For you

You're here with me, so happy to be this way

I should have told you
Every word I say is true
I'm so in love, I'm so in love with you [So in love with you]

'Cause I'm falling [Falling] under your spell tonight
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh]
I'm falling [Falling] under your spell so right [Do, do, do, do, do, do]
Love's calling [Calling] under your spell tonight
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh]
Yes, I'm falling [Falling] under your spell so right

We were known as the great lovers
We had that magic from the start
We had so much to give each other, ooh babe
But now you're telling me
You lost the spark
Hold on tight
Don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again
With all of my mind
I'll try to make things right
Can't we fall in love again

La... La... La...
La, la, la, la... La, la...

You... led me to love again
You..., you must have known by then
Your dream would start to take you far away from me
And love was less important than your dream
You're finally found success
I saw you even less
Those midnight calls from concert halls
Increased my loneliness

Now I'm just another face in the crowd
Calling for you to take your bow
And I'm just another face in the crowd
Crying inside, cheering out loud
For you

You..., you were the very best
...

Here comes the night
If I could be in the light of you
I would not be thinkin' about you
Here comes the rain
I don't know how to explain to you
What it feels like living without you

Isn't it sad
When you think we had the love
Too good to last
It burned too hot, too fast
Too good to last

Hey! You wanna ride?
(purrs)

Riding the tiger
Mess with me, you'll fall in love
I said that you're riding the tiger
Are you red enough? (Are you red enough?)
Are you red enough?

Said, don't riding the tiger
Mess with me, you'll fall in love, baby
Riding the tiger
Are you red enough? (Are you red enough?)
Are you red enough?

Do you burn in the night?
Ahh, don't tangle with me
Could you put up a fight?
I'm not afraid to be free
Do you grin when you bite?
Jump off, and you'll see
Ooh...

Did you know where you've been?
I got a hunk every day
Is a pleasure of sin?
Gonna make you my prey
Can you tell when you win?
I don't let nothing stand in my way
Ha, ha! Whoo!

Sometimes it said love it taste so sweet
May knock you off your feet
If you can't stand the heat,
I said to get off my back, oh!

A million times or more I thought about you
The years, the tears, the laughter, things we used to do

Our memories that warm me like a sunny day
You touched my life in such a special way

I miss the way you ran your fingers through my hair
Those crazy nights we cuddled in your easy chair

Oh no, I won't let foolish pride turn you away
I'll take you back whatever price I pay

Old friend
It's so nice to feel you hold me again

J-J-J-J-J-Just wanna be your girl
J-J-J-J-J-J-Just wanna be your.
Don't wanna change it

Aah, aah, aah

They know I ain't no saint, I ain't no politician
Baby, that's not my way
I just wanna be the one you give your love to
Each and every day
Since I saw you, boy, I've only got one ambition
That's to win your heart
Ain't no better cause, don't give me other mission
I've got to have you home

Don't wanna change the world
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world
I Just wanna be your girl

Don't wanna change it

I used to spend my time just working for a dollar
Never had too much fun
I'll be working steady building up my power
The power of one
But since I saw you, boy, I've only got one ambition
...

I can't hold you like I want to
Can't hold you to the promises you make
You won't be here tonight or any other night

It would be a lie to say I'm not afraid
But to be afraid is something that I've always been
The difference is this time I'm not giving in

Yes, I am alone, yes, I'm on my own
But for the first time in my life
I'm gonna carry on, yes, I'm gonna ache

But I will not break, some things I can choose
...
