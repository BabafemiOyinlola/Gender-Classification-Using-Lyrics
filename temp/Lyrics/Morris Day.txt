Daydreaming, just daydreaming
Well, it's kind of fun for one who's all alone
Daydreaming, just daydreaming
Helps me find the joy, the boy I call my own
Night comes on, it's true I'm blue
My heart is with the sun

Trapped at 1st glance

a victim without chance
pulled in by the bait

when i caught the fishnets

showin through the holes
fishnets black pantyhose
shes out 2 catch u
with those big black pantyhose

closer i cant c
these drawers i could not pass
she turned toward me
things were movin kinda fast
kinda fast

As a boy you learn to win
You learn to pick and choose
Though you love to play the game
You're so afraid to lose
And it takes a man
Just to understand a man's pride

It's a man's pride baby
It makes him laugh
It makes him cry
It's a man's pride that keeps a man alive

When you're young you make mistakes
That tend to leave you sad
As you grow you learn to take
The good things with the bad
Cause it takes a man
Just to understand a man's pride
As a man it all begins
You change your point of view
And it seems it never ends
The things you're going through
You see it takes a man
Just to understand a man's pride

Hold on, hold on, why y'all beatin' on shit, what's that mean?
Hold up, do y'all wanna learn a new dance?
Are you qualified to learn one? That's what I thought
Who can dance out there? Okay, we gonna try a new dance
And if I don't see everybody doin' it, I don't wanna see you no more
Jellybean, are we ready? Y'all better do this one
What time is it? Alright, y'all got 10 seconds
To get to the dance floor and whawk

America, have you heard?
I got a brand new dance and it's called "The Bird"
You don't need no finesse or no personality
You just need two arms and an attitude
And everybody sing with me, come on now

Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa
Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa

Brothers, don't be cool
Women like it sometimes when you act a fool
Sisters, don't be shy
Let your body get loose, you ain't to fat to fly
Come on now

Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa
Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa

Yes, hold on now, this dance ain't for everybody

I guess you've heard of my reputation, I've had my share of foolin' around.
But everybody needs stimulation, and mine just happens to be all over town.
It's an easy-money occupation, a first-class psychiatry.
But just once, I'd wanna make love without taking off my clothes.
Just once, I wanna make love with somebody who really and truly knows:

Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too.
All my lovers need stimulation, but honey babe, I think that I need you.

Maybe you're the kind of person, that could turn my world around.
Won't you gimme little inspiration? Maybe that's what I need to make me settle down.
It's an easy-money occupation, but honey one thing understand.

I got a penthouse in Manhattan, two more in Malibu.
I bought a '87s Cadillac Seville, girl I got a Mazarati too.
I wear diamonds on my fingers, I got a couple on my toes.
I wear the finest perfume money can buy, it keeps me smellin' like a rose.

If you wonder how I do it, there's just one simple rule.
I'm just cool. Honey, baby, can't you see?
Girl, I'm so cool. Ain't nobody bad like me?

C O O L.
What's that spell? - C O O L.

I might dine in San Francisco, dance all night in Rome.
I go any freakin' place I want you, and my lear jet brings me home.
I got ladies by the dozens, I got money by the ton.
Just ain't nobody better, heaven knows that I'm the one.

And it's all because of something that I didn't learn in school.
I'm just cool. Honey, baby, can't you see?
Girl, I'm so cool. Ain't nobody bad like me?

Sing it baby. - C O O L.
What's that spell? - C O O L.

We are young, we are free on earth together. Let's fall in love.
You are fine, you are white, I am of color. Let's fall in love.

Ice cream castles in the summertime.
Ice cream castles in the summer.

I want you, you want me, we want each other. Is that so wrong?
It's raining. Mad sisters, why can't they realize, that it won't be long?

We're all ice cream castles in the summertime.
Ice cream castles in the summer.
Let's do something soon.

We are young, we are free. Let's come together before the end.

Girl, I called you up to say,
that I'm havin' trouble sleepin' ever since you went away.
Girl, I know you need a little time,
to get your head together. But baby, I can't stop cryin'.

Girl, why'd you go away?
What can I say to make you stay?
Girl, I was a fool.
I don't know what to do.
I'm still in love with you.

I'm still in love with you, baby.

: b
Patience gone
Time to move along
No one to blame
It is time to win
Don't criticize
Try to realize
I am number one in the end.

Play to win
That is the color, the color of success
I play to win; oh, I
Play to win
There is no other
Color of success
I play to win; oh, I

Free as a bird
It is time to spread the word
Dark whether is gone
The sun is shining
First, understand
I am not your typical man
Shrewd, I am kind
You cannot deny me

Play to win

Guess I'm just a victim, girl
Victim of society
I guess I'm just a character
At least that's what the people think
(That's what they think!)

[CHORUS I]
I'm just a victim, girl
(He's just a victim!)
Victim of life today
(Society!)
I'm just a character
(You've got the character!)
At least that's what the people say
(That's what they say!)

You think that you in love with me
I think you're beautiful and should be free
I'M JUST A YOUNG MAN GOT LOTS OF TIME
Right now that kind of thing isn't on my mind

Don't wait for me
(I'll just make love to you girl)
Then set you free

I'm just a young man
What makes you think that I have the time oh oh
2 people falling in love in my prime

You think I'm afraid of how it would be
Might be too cautious girl don't blame me
Time after time again baby I tried
Don't take it personal girl
Still on your side no

Don't wait for me
(I'll just make love to you girl)
