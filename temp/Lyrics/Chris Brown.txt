Take it off
I wanna love you
If Everybody
Wanna touch you
You move it right
Wanna see what's up under
You back it up, beep beep like a trucker.
Nice thighs, nice waist, and you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter
I'm about to make your pockets better.

Girl I just wanna see you strip, right now,
Cause it's late, late!
Girl I just wanna see you strip
Girl, take it down with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip
God damn you're sexy! (on me!)
God damn you're sexy! (baby!)
God damn you're sexy! (aahh aahh)
Girl I just wanna see you...

Got my shades on
With my jays on
In the club with a pocket full of ones

EVANGELICAL FELLOWSHIP OF BOTSWANA
STATEMENT OF THE YEAR
The Evangelical Fellowship of Botswana (EFB) would like to take this time to wish all Batswana and the nation at large, a happy and prosperous new year.
The Lord has shown mercy to this nation from its inception as a Republic and has continued to this far.
We pray that He continue to sustain us even as we continue to depend on Him for guidance through prayers in our various congregations, business meetings and private lives.
May God keep us united as a people regardless of our political divide, tribe, or race.
May He give our country more rains, more minerals, the wisdom to diversify the economy and the "power to prosper".
EFB wishes to take this time to urge its members to intensify prayer and evangelism efforts seeing that the enemy is doing all to cause harm and keep people in spiritual bondages.
In recent years, we have seen an escalation of Satanism in our public schools, drug and substance abuse among the youth, juvenile delinquencies, breaking down of families, increasing HIV infections, passion killings, mischievous and rascal behaviors.
A case in point is the recent events in Thamaga culminating in an innocent elderly parent being killed.
We have evidenced an increase in corrupted sexual morals, infiltration of anti-societal norms, road carnages etc.
All these behaviors, call for intensified prayer and evangelism effort and we thus call all EFB churches and those subscribing to the evangelical doctrine of regeneration to intensify evangelism effort.
We remind our beloved citizens that we are now less than a year towards the end of 2016, our 50th Independence annivesary where we have set a clear vision of what nation we wish to be.
We therefore urge every Motswana to redouble his or her effort to realize the vision.
We pray that God continues to assist us all to realise this noble vision.
At the EFB we will actively and passionately continue our role as a prophetic voice and a moral compass to the nation.
We do this without fear or favour and know that the nation continues to heed our voice of caution and reason.
We therefore wish to reiterate some of our concerns as follows
EFB's continues to caution the nation particularly those in leadership to uphold the righteous standards set by our forefathers.
The standards they set includes but not limited to criminalising homosexuality, prostitution and abortion.

Put one hand in the air and put the other one in your hair
And baby show me how you get down low to the floor on this song, its only one mission I'm on

I won't leave this club alone, if you don't wanna leave right now with me
Just let me know cause everybody sweating you, sitting right next to you and I ain't said nothing

I know it's hard right now to say yes to me, but I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way, you look to me now, we need to get down
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me girl

I ain't never fell for a girl like you, like you, with jeans and a body that curves like you, like you
I don't really care what they say, when it comes to a difference of age, I can show you all the things I'll do
Break your heart, never raise my voice, girl let down your guard
I know it's a lot to ask trust in me, but I can make a difference right now you'll see

Yeah, id like to introduce to you the future,
The young, the new R&B prince, Chris Brown
Spit flame, And me stick around ya boy Chris Brown

Have you ever seen a 4 door machine
when them things swing open (girl picture that)
Have you ever traveled upon a yacht
Sail across the ocean (girl picture that)
Tell me have you ever seen the stars
Shoot across the nite sky from a G4 sky
Can u picture it?
Matter fact pretend you and me living it.

I know im just a youngin
But girl im in a good groove, right zone
I just need a year or two.
Let me stack this paper, imam keep the lights on
Let me show u what a hit single can do
And we can act a fool with it
So much diamonds you wont know what to do with it
(Whats my name?)
The name Chris Brown from Virginia
Ask about me and theyll tell you im the truth with it

C to the H to the R.I.S.
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didnt know now you know

C to the H to the R.I.S.

Yeah, woo, ooo, woo, ooo, woo, ooo

Baby, come here and sit down

So I guess I'll start by sayin' that I love you
But you know this thing ain't been a walk in the park (for us)
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't want to see you cry
But I don't want to be the one to tell you a lie, so

How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door?
When you're walking out, talk about it, and
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'm a do the best I can to get you to understand
Cause I know!!

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I, I gotta, gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye

If you had a choice then
what would you choose, to do.
I can live without money
I can live without the fame and
if every day was sunny I can live

without the rain and if I ever went
up to heaven I will fall right back
down that life wouldn't be living
cause you're the one I couldn't live without.
If I couldn't blink will I still
be able to see you.

I couldn't imagine (ooohoo)
without arms could I reach
no way could I ever hold you (ohohooo)

This right here is the 16 year old phenome, Chris Breezy.
Me, myself, I'm the 23 yr. old CEO

Young Carter, I'm harder then them other boys.
I ain't even fronting, baby I can take a summer off.
I can break a woman off.
I can take the stomach off, one of my trucks.
Now I'm riding in the goods.
Line it on up, guarantee you get served.
Lil' Chris, said run it,
So I ran and to her.
I'm a cash money young'n,
Bird-man junior.
Just a president, looking for a minor occurrence.

The young boy just turned 16 and I got
6 4's and hot bikes that I rock.
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on clock,
but all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him.
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop,
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk.
That sassy tempo with that walk,
May be the reason that all this teenies may never see me.

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)

Forever
It's you, and me
Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah)
Tonight, is the night

To join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music go 'round you, around you
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby We can go anywhere

Go anywhere

But first, it's your chance
So take my hand
Come with me
It's like I waited my whole life
For this one night
Its gon' be me you and the dance floor

'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure

Double your fun
And dance forever ever ever
Forever ever ever

Forever ever ever

Forever (forever)

Weak
I have been crying and crying for weeks
How'd I survive when I can barely speak
Barely eat
On my knees

But that's the moment you came to me
I don't know what your love has done to me
Think I'm invincible
I see through the me
I used to be

You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing
To me with your love
I'm feeling a superhuman
You did that to me
Superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman

I feel so superhuman

It's a 360 turn, sittin' where we begin
Beginnin' like here's the end
Like kissin' and missin' class

But we needed to learn
Was different than just some math
It's the big picture, we missed it
The figures just didn't add up

We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words
It could be love right?

But are we gon' leave
When it's this good?
Damn it just 'cause
Seems this lovin's all for nothing
Baby, you know

A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you
A happy endin' makes it right
'Cause it ends when you don't want to

And it makes perfect sense
To end it like the start
How do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain
But I'm thinkin' that I still love you

I said
Is this life, is this my time to waste
I got all this money calling me, how the fuck I'ma turn it down
And I done fucked around and bought too many cars now
Baby I guess that I'm a superstar now
But I wish that I could go back
Cause that money don't mean a thing when
Everybody's changing

Crying with their hands out
What the fuck you want from me
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me
Fuck a one on one

Wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back
From where I came from

And if I knew then what I know now

If you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'mma blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself I was fast asleep
Since you came around I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
Yi-yi-yikes I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer, if I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse, better if I don't speak
Devil's tryna tempt me, they just outline my shape out
Place me at the crime scene
I can see from this high up, you ain't got a heart girl
Privacy is for the cheater obviously you're deceiving

I know
I know just who you are
You put me on lay away
You just love to heart shock

Something like dirty diana, body dope as heron
And the sex off the handle
Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego
It's too strong, you said the drive stick
Well baby just peel off
Loving how it lasts long, Leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on, Halloween pussy
Your body shivers and troubles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever, enough to sink a boat

When you so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying
Because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you

So please babe
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful

Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful

You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I'm not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player

I wanna take a selfie with you, 
Show the world you're all mine, all mine, yeah

'Cause this Christmas, will be the
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues
I know you gon' be dashing through the snow, down these chimneys
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me
'Cause this Christmas, will be the
Greatest time of your life from me
I ain't asking for the diamond rings
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself while the children sleeps
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?

Hooray!
Time, boy

Stop your whining, and sum it up, what are we now?

Sometimes I get sentimental (sentimental, oh)
And I get all in my head (in my head, oh)
I get caught up in my feelings 
(I get caught up in my feelings, oh)
And regret the things I said 
(I said, yeah, yeah)

It's not magic (magic)
Baby, there's no secret to love (no no, no no no no no)
We used to have it, but I just didn't fight out enough 
(yeah, enough, enough)
To hold onto you, no, oh yeah (no, yeah)
Still keep thinking 'bout the way you kiss (way you kiss)
And it's way too hard for me not to sit and reminisce (sit and reminisce)
Love is so tough, make the memories hit so hard (hit so hard, so hard)
Hit so hard, make me wanna think back, make me want that old thing back, oh no no no no (think back, old thing back)

I haven't felt this way in years (this way in years)
I want it all to stop now, girl, I hate to dream about you (about you)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gon' live my life without you,
It's so hard, I'm almost in tears (without you, in tears)
But this dangerous game, girl, I've have been playing,

You don't love me like you used to

You don't touch me like you used to

Where did I go wrong? When did I lose focus?
When did you move on? It seems like I never noticed

I've been looking for love in all the wrong places
(all the wrong places)
And I've been looking for you in other girl's faces,
It's time that I faced it (in other girl's faces)
I messed up with you
I played the game but I broke all the rules

I fell out of paradise
And now all I do is cry
It hurts when you fall out of paradise
It cuts me just like a knife
Got me all of out place and it don't feel right
Got lost in the sun
And now I'm paying the price

You found a new man and said we were even now

I wish you could put it behind you
Wish you would put up your blinders
Wish you would stop listening to you friends
And come to where no one would find us
Wish you would just keep your focus on me
So I can give you a reminder
That I can be who I'm supposed to
I can do better, I know you remember

Every single night, we were living life in love
Every single time, I was doing right, enough
To keep you around, now look at where I end up

We do it like we rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room, we be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on, doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you, and I love you
That's just how it is

‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more, ‘til we get it
I'mma get it, I'mma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it

Fucking lame niggas, I don't really understand
'Cause you know I'ma cash out, fuck the rubberbands
I bought you everything, peanut butter Benz
You was s'posed to be there when I got out of jail
But you'd rather hoe out with all of your friends
Going crazy, did my time, you ain't send me mail
Take it as I was tryna make you win, ain't had no bail
You supposed to be down for your nigga
Baby, we would, baby, who you with? Girl, you sipping
I was supposed to have your heart
But you just kept me in the dark painting pictures
I know you lying and you sneaking, I'm just stating facts
I'm just that dummy who believed you 'cause I loved your ass
Not the only nigga who been through that
But I'm the only nigga with receipts and popping tags


I was looking forward to us making love
And waking up for round two
But you ain't stayed long enough, it's fucking me up
Learning from them hoes that's around you

And now you up on games, no
You don't see me the same, no

Popping bars, it's easy but, but I still hurt the same

Left the key downstairs, get it on your way in
She said: I ain't got no panties on
And you gon' leave with no panties on

And that night I'm going through the same thing
She know I ain't looking for a main thing
And she gon' do whatever for a real one
I switch 'em up, just like a million, hey

Faces in my pillow case
Mascara on my sheets
She shake it for the money

You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I'm not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real

She doesn't call before midnight, if at all

Oh, she never stays to watch the night turn to day

But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight

But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down

Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
But I just wanna be the one to do you right
We're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
And I'm hoping that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in a club?
Cause I wanna tell them they wrong
Come on, just baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby
Love me, love you crazy

Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives

They wanna hold you back tell 'em pee off.
Whenever they say you can't take the c off.
I remember when they told me i wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality's simultaneous.

And, work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal, they can take you off.
And there's a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don't make do with what you got

Yeah, so go and get it in sunny
Not everybody get's a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky
So you gotta fill the hunger in your tummy.

I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead

I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves

You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that

Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath

But now... if you really wanna know
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you...
zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you...
zero, zero
I thought you were the one (ayee), then you turn and run (ayee)
Found somebody better, like I never met ya

I can feel it burn inside my head
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off

You know what time it is?
Legendary
And I brought some of my friends with me
Like they here, here go, huh

Faces in my pillow case
Mascara on my sheets
She shake it for the money
She shake it like a freak, oh
Only for me, me, me, oh
Tonight, only for me, me, me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight

Told her, you ain't gotta tell no lies, girl, you ain't gotta tell no lies
I don't wanna be the one who judge you, baby, it's your life
I ain't gon' gas you up, girl but that ass on fire
And I know you got a man, but fuck that nigga nine, uh huh
All these niggas tryna holla
I'm ain't tryna waste your time, tryna bother
I just wanna come through, do you got friends?
I ain't tryna press you, do you got plans?
Room 112 at the Four Seasons
Left the key downstairs, get it on your way in
She said: I ain't got no panties on
And you gon' leave with no panties on

And that night I'm going through the same thing
She know I ain't looking for a main thing
And she gon' do whatever for a real one
I switch 'em up, just like a million, hey

Faces in my pillow case
Mascara on my sheets
She shake it for the money

I need your body in ways
That you don't understand, but I'm losing my patience
'Cause we've been going over and over again
Girl, I just wanna take you home and get right to it
Know I gotta kiss it, baby
Give it to me, lick it, lick it inside and now
You know that I just wanna make love
Want you to scream and shout
And baby, when I'm deep in it now
I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit
When we're moving at the speed of sound
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?
Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one
You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air
You know your panties never getting in the way
You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it

Ayy you, girl, with the tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka (boom, boom)
We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me

Every dream in my head
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
And when I get to the edge
I turn around and put that dream behind me
And it never feels the way I want
But I keep on trying
I just keep on trying


Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life

Ow! Welcome to my

Hello, this is my life in your TV
I overdose in that night life, them bright lights and bikinis
I keep my hand on that gold bottle, I'm tryna find me that genie
They say money doesn't buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in that
Lamborghini
Damn, I don't know who I am
I just know who I wanna be
No looking back, everything is in front of me
I never act like they putting a gun to me

Kept me tipping on four, diamond trippin', prolly sippin' on four
Ferragamo slippers dipped 'em in gold with so many women, think I'm pimpin' on hoe

Cause my wrist still drippin', popo still tip
In the cut with my hittas, no they do not miss
I'm a champagne pourin' nigga, I love big asses and tits (Show me them tities)
And if you're here just to witness, I just just promise this

Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip

EVANGELICAL FELLOWSHIP OF BOTSWANA
STATEMENT OF THE YEAR
The Evangelical Fellowship of Botswana (EFB) would like to take this time to wish all Batswana and the nation at large, a happy and prosperous new year.
The Lord has shown mercy to this nation from its inception as a Republic and has continued to this far.
We pray that He continue to sustain us even as we continue to depend on Him for guidance through prayers in our various congregations, business meetings and private lives.
May God keep us united as a people regardless of our political divide, tribe, or race.
May He give our country more rains, more minerals, the wisdom to diversify the economy and the "power to prosper".
EFB wishes to take this time to urge its members to intensify prayer and evangelism efforts seeing that the enemy is doing all to cause harm and keep people in spiritual bondages.
In recent years, we have seen an escalation of Satanism in our public schools, drug and substance abuse among the youth, juvenile delinquencies, breaking down of families, increasing HIV infections, passion killings, mischievous and rascal behaviors.
A case in point is the recent events in Thamaga culminating in an innocent elderly parent being killed.
We have evidenced an increase in corrupted sexual morals, infiltration of anti-societal norms, road carnages etc.
All these behaviors, call for intensified prayer and evangelism effort and we thus call all EFB churches and those subscribing to the evangelical doctrine of regeneration to intensify evangelism effort.
We remind our beloved citizens that we are now less than a year towards the end of 2016, our 50th Independence annivesary where we have set a clear vision of what nation we wish to be.
We therefore urge every Motswana to redouble his or her effort to realize the vision.
We pray that God continues to assist us all to realise this noble vision.
At the EFB we will actively and passionately continue our role as a prophetic voice and a moral compass to the nation.
We do this without fear or favour and know that the nation continues to heed our voice of caution and reason.
We therefore wish to reiterate some of our concerns as follows
EFB's continues to caution the nation particularly those in leadership to uphold the righteous standards set by our forefathers.
The standards they set includes but not limited to criminalising homosexuality, prostitution and abortion.

Guess the vodka brought the feeling back

But now, if you really wanna know
