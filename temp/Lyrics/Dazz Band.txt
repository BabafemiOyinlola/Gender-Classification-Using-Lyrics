So get with it

If you don't want a ticket you better move on
If you break the law you gotta pay your dues
Ain't much better if you play it by the rules

Cause it's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it with your body, baby
It's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy if you drive it all night

No parking, baby

Causes so much misery
Are you playing around
Don't ever take my love for granted
Are you playing around
Don't tie your chips to high on me
Are you playing around
You're almost sure to be a loser
Tired of being by myself
Guess I'll find me someone who won't
Gamble, Gamble with my love, my love
Gamble with me lonely
Hey baby don't gamble with my love yeah
Gamble, don't gamble with my love, my love

When you're subject to give it up and throw it all away

Think again before you do it you might need a little more patience along the way

You must take it all in stride

Hold onto your dreams and maintain all of the beauty

There're some things you should never hide

Just believe in love
l hope you hold on to love
If you believe in love you will survive

Just believe in love
I hope you hold on to love
Keep love in your life
Keep love in your life
