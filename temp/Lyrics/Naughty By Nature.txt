Got a few things that's on my mind
So nigga gon' listen up while I free it
Whatever's needed, I'ma get it
And if I wanna get weeded, I'ma hit it
All of these dramas, niggas ain't sayin' they did it

Niggas is bucklin' up under pressure
Nevertheless still screamin' they thugs
If crap don't work for the number 1
I'm packin' my heat, sellin' more drugs
Ain't a damn thing ceasin, if my bankroll decreasin'
Open up shop at the first of the month
nigga, continue my creepin' on a come up
until I'm done up, dead and gone
You can look at my life and call me bad
But nigga, you read me wrong
And, nigga, I be head over heels 'til I get fifty mill or mo'
If it's this dough these niggas wanna kill me for
Well I refuse to be broke
I'm contemplatin' murder on the government
Desporito be the motto
All shit be hard to swallow be ready for war if you follow
Atend hut, two, three, fo'
Soldiers get your paper
Nigga, you die if you a hater
Take it from a thug by nature, by nature

Cause I'm a thug by nature, thug by nature, yeah, yeah

Yoke the Joker!
*laughter*

Intro: Treach

There are too many overnight MC's but one
And too many wacked who haven't paid dues
You have now entered the path of the Flavor Unit
and we are Naughty By Nature, and we will just do, by terminating you

Verse 1: Treach

I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fuckin joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chung Li's temple I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losin is small talk
I ain't a punk, I'll slot'cha, furthermore I don't scare chief
The reason I called you 'pussy' cos you are what you eat, each
look is a little closer to the centre of a blowpipe
Don't speak when I am talkin, this is my fuckin sho-op
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you be funky, while
you're smilin backstage doin mother, ugh, doggystyle
Hot, wild, raw, whores' still suave
*laughter* Check out this style that I've
soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
semi-social, never seem sloppy
See silly slappin suckers, sorry saps and slouchers
Straps slammin stouch, mackin this mass is savvy
We see so-so-songs and some shots, so
snaps steppin separate, start slowly, go solo

Intro: Queen Latifah

Mercifully, mercifully, mercifully massacre, Naughty By Nature
Thru it ever time, comin at a dance
My man Treacherous MC, go on, let the saxophone man play a little
Make it lovely

Verse 1: Treach

You got beef, well what we do, talk to the bunny, sunny
He's the man, Bugs the thug wit the money
Funny that you should mention as my family, they covered
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together
No matter what your whatever, endeavour, find us better
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rollin spreads
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya
head
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago
Witta new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come

Chorus: Queen Latifah

Everytime they comin at the dance, what you know
It's time for rum, man, yeah man

Army with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em

OPP how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?

Smooth it out
This is a story about a drifter
Who waited for the worst while the best live 'cross town
Who never planned on having someday
Why me huh?!

Some get a little, and some get none
Some catch a bad one, and some leave the job half-done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, motherfuck the fag
Well anyway, I did pick-up, lift and click-up
See many stick-ups, 'cos niggas had the trigger hick-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, with just a clip, who wanna hit
Thank God I'm quick, I had to eat this money as good as spent
A 'do in braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a hair-cut
I got laughed at, I got jumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a tick and a banana clip
With down the flow, don't let them any dealin' tackhead
A celebate rope, so a lotta good it woulda did
Or done, if not bad luck I would have none
Why did I have to live the life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was the sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one

Bass me, face me, task the tip of a tastey
Bitches are sweet as a pastry
You don't know me homey, from a peach or a pony
I'm the Only, now your lyrics look lonely
Lyrically fortified, born, I'm immortalised
Lightin shit up from Wranglers to raw hides
Packed with black positivity and wizardry
I'm my own body and it built for partyin
I rip hearts apart as if it's my last rap
the lords abroad and I represent that ass dat
shows seniority, lays the foundation
Bolos and donuts, oh I built the nation
Keep the faith tastin, keep the touch clutched
Keep your face way away from the rough stuff
If it ain't rough it ain't rugged
Either you are born with none or you're stacked or star-studded
>From the to end I will flow
and aslo, yo come let the ho's go

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho (Let the ho's go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Verse 1: Treach

This is somethin that I call the flow
Not many if any 'cept for Vinnie can say they know
In fact detracting that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro) you say cheeka boo
A name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga actor will do, ooh
Dressed to the best to impress but after they try take us in
Crook as a nigga, take a pistol, see who wants to be Naughty or nicest
Like ice is I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see whose hype is
Test the test the Treach to Treach address, the address:
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
Why to try to chrome, my style is just nonsense
M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-mackin so you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many are small should call
Naughty By Nature the creator of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way
This is how we play everyday all day

Verse 2: Treach

Yo yo hey yo
Havin a round of (? cadavva?), gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee
Hand to Gee the producer, me is loose off the claps ya see
That keeps you boogie'n happily
Voice ya opinion, it's the rhythm I'm lendin
The message I'm sendin from London to Linley
Girls are given a chance to get ya all pampered
Leave them ol' cramps in your pants then I belly dance her
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leavin em evil and seein em bein a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these call shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall darlin
Cos on the shrift and Naughty ain't waltzin
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knockin and poppin em up inside, they rockin dawn til dusk

(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

Verse 1: Treach

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been thru more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm runnin this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted cos you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin too gay, you're tryin too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, yup!

Chorus:

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

Oh finally, finally (here we are)
And for good are the three, follow me (it ain't far)
Even though if it was, you could make it to the start
The enemies, do you know who they are? (there they are)

A devil with the dorags be walkin', now I had it up to there
Oh yeah, that's the last straw (the nature's back for)
Better than Disco (R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-round) Uh-Uh-Uh

Pin the tail on the junkie, find a false flavor
It's a new day to play with a neighbour
Freeze the MC's that wanna see thee
By now naugh-ty by nature by me

They want me to come and come up faster, that could be arranged
Dump the last of the matinee, 'cos they couldn't stand the damn rain
The pain's the same, the game remains mine
I got more hooks than a fish line

Bite the head off a snake
Chew up from the first to last break and shoot 'em in the face
Make way, (move), boy, you detest me! (Huh, huh, huh)
I seen your last porno flick, it ain't impress me

Wassup? Cuddle sport, here's a thought
(The only records that they got, are the records their crew bought)
Damn real B rock, get fienin, spunky
Pin the tail on the donkey

(Bring that beat back)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I do more poppin than a blockhead
Wreck the waxheads, I'm fed
(Go ahead, you retired tackhead)
Back to the fact of the track witha new thought

You couldn't smoke blunts witha match and a Newport
Here we go, we go, we go again, witha flow we know, we know it's in

Shit, shaved, and bathed e'ryday then I must go
Ugh, this is Everyday All Day, let's all say
Pluckin enough and roughin em up and fuckin em up always
Bet, let's talk about a back flash, ya jackass
That fast you flash witta match, your fast rap
And even though you didn't know me before the flow solo
It's no slow way to go, bolos I throw or sold
Let's pick a bitch to pick with, peekaboo
I see you thru your crew, now whatchu wanna do?
After that, caps off to the black frost
My pants always sag cos I rap my ass off (Oooooh)
You wanna talk about a badboy *? sanchoi?*
I'm bad as they come, chum, straight up ricochet rap style
To Vin Rock and KayGee, I'm the baby
Droppin the ladies, cravin ya maybe, I have the right to be lazy
Got more stretch to my swing and the stretch of a chicken wing
The flavor is bacon and its cravin is icecream
I'm too trucked to be fucked and too live, otherwise
Ya drive by's smuffler, word to the mother, my brother eyed
Runnin and comin, drama starin wit a stellar
I need so many lumps, I'll use your head as a braille book
Many friends ships ink, quick, fast
It'll take a dollar worth of gas to outlast your little tired ass
You tried to swing this way, you little swifty
(Ha ha ha, slum bitches still miss me)
I do the dumpin, humpin, clappin like thunder
and that's comin from a land down under

Stun me with R&B harmony
So far, first to the O-R
Hand the bill until paid is a coastguard
The sonar, sounds that will throw your
feet, to no more, no tour, show more
First ability, deeper agility
No harassment, pass the humility
A new style blessed with a few styles
Rhyme'll shine on, I'm on a new prowl
Clap your hands in the evening
Come on y'all, say "It's alright" before leavin
I like a party, overpumped and lovely
All who flow, show, you think you love me
Bow in the balcony, say "Owwwwww" for me (Owwwww)
Now dance, so shall we?
All night long to a long, good, strong song
Hug, the rhyme'll shine on much stronger
A tougher chart buster went tutta

In the place for anybody not payin' on time
Rather be up in a six foot cell
Before I let another nigga get flagrant with mine

And we be takin' all cash, no checks, so go cancel this
I know niggaz are so scandalous
The ones I bust I'ma show 'em nuff crugs on how many people
Thinkin' that they can stand with this, sheeyit

I thought somebody told you, boy
Them Naughty niggaz ain't no toys
You're fuckin' with sixteen styles over sixteen bars
Sixteen car, man entourage

And when we get things started, I'm the hardest artist
Styles I flips retarded
Family who can handle this
From Illtown to S.E. to Los Angeles

I thought I told you, have my money
(Whatcha wan' do, nigga?)
You got until sunrise or lose your life
(Whatcha gon' do, nigga?)

We comin' with them thangs and we ready to ride

Put me on the planet, damn it, where all the slim shhh look like Janet

Pick, rub and ran it how I run it yeah I ran it
And it ran frantic rub put new poonanie panic

Trick it and attract it, throw a crack then catch it
Quick as richocet rabbit, quick 'cause it's a habit
To rap it as fast as another brother runnin' rapid

Give it up for Naughty By Nature

Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

Cold on the streets, they bang so we got to bang back
So I rep my hood, my city, my borough, thorougly
That's all we have

Father if you still listening, we hope our prayers make it up to heaven
If we fall then we're not forgotten don't let our lil' brothers end up like we did
Let them grow up and get a job
Don't let them grow up behind bars, trying to be hard
Oh, Father can you swiffen my feet
Repping the wrong colour on the wrong street with no heat
Rocking hickies and truckers, bandannas my brothers
My haters or lovers we still got each other
We twist our hands up and pull our pants up
Walk this way throw your flag and your setup

Banged before ain't forgettin go 'head start all your crap
and get a boot from a lawsuit and a news conference at eleven
Routine stops how often? Tri day before last week (word?)
Always tryin to pull me over on these dark ass streets
Gave the war two blocks, two middle fingers like my nigga
Mr. Fuck-a-Cop Tupac so fuck them mug shots that you got
My Boo stops for nathin, know that Bonnie and Clyde
If that was then there'll be no Texas with you Tommy's inside
Chasin cases got that badge and know you runnin the place
But that ain't NAR' a fuckin reason to have them guns in my face
And your attitude's, like you ain't no had no nookie (go jerk off)

Broke rims, smoked sims, whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw, from who'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill, but I cut for the cars
Smokin' buddha with a hoota', get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters, leed a luga with duga
Some say modelin' and acting mean treach is selling

While I'm yelling, first a felon with my gat at ya melon
Hella heated, too ill for them to beat it
Most cheated, most weeded, most needed, you best believe it

And many people really ain't worth the mentionin
Thugs, me hugs, and plus a little gentle friend
Or the mentals if I wile I get antetion then
Do my drama from court to case
While others turn they back I turn my hate to faith
Thats why I'm here, but boo's, any place or date
If theres tear in my eyes you come to dry my face
Now thats deep, y'all turned from my fans to my friends
After the past, I didnt think I could stand it again
On the streets, me and Miny wonderin shall I kill
I do for all, when will someone ask me how I feel?
Ladies, if youre down and my pics on youre wall
Just pop in this song and wont let you fall
To all my ladies, got ya letters and I love you to death
Now I appreciate the breath that the dear lord left

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?

Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?

I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are
full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixin's that ain't fitting to be hitting.
On nothing splitting things that's bitten
And getting written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off

You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
lyrically splittin dismissin
I'm on a mission of just hitting
now it's written and kitten hittin wit mittens
I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are
full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

1-So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixins that ain't fittin to be hittin.
On nothin splittin things that's bitten
And gettin written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off
Before you even started so what

Hang out and hustle wit my friends, yeah

The C R U D D Y, the C L I C K
It's texture, pure terror, a street professorv
Aggressor, scale and measure
Clever compressor stretching salary stacks
Be running blocks as a factory structure

Capture the raw product I manufacture, fracture critic chatter
Nigga catcher as I blast a cop matter, capsule shatter
Scatter midnight disasters, clips I rather gather
Then flip for what I'm after

Now and forever, money makes things better
At a regular, gets me jewelry, bitches, bankcards, cars and competitors Proposed threats wreck necks and puff ya puzzled
See trouble muzzles when I hang and hustle

Hang out and hustle wit my friends, yeah
Hang out and hustle wit my friends, yeah

Booda bop, boom, bam, bink, bick bow bookow
Ratatat, klack klick, klick kow, klick kow
Put brains with muscle, hear a crew of guys utilize they skills
Bang out, hang out, slang out, work and hustle

Flip techniques over boogie bangin' beats
A street fleet with Moet, dank and freaks in twenty separate suite
I'm servin' dope lyrics holding weight, just like Chris Webber

Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

Mama don't cry for me, Papa don't feel bad
Cold on the streets, they bang so we got to bang back
So I rep my hood, my city, my borough, thorougly
That's all we have

Father if you still listening, we hope our prayers make it up to heaven
If we fall then we're not forgotten don't let our lil' brothers end up like we did
Let them grow up and get a job
Don't let them grow up behind bars, trying to be hard
Oh, Father can you swiffen my feet
Repping the wrong colour on the wrong street with no heat
Rocking hickies and truckers, bandannas my brothers
My haters or lovers we still got each other
We twist our hands up and pull our pants up
Walk this way throw your flag and your setup

My thoughts are thundering, tumblin
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling ta mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary, as I roll reality thru galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of oiu
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
from Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
lifers, Rikers ta foesome
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening to slow
I'm abrupting construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin 'bout an obstruction or turning something of nothing
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin me up

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest
Utah niggas are the craziest

This is a story about the drifter
Who waited through the worst for the best in crosstown
Who never planned on havin' so dick
Why me, huh?

Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where ANYWAY I didN'T pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, WITH THIS HERE clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'M DOIN' BRAIDS, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none

You get her name and number then left feelin' real mellow

Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T

With a little bit of taste of the bass to the face
In the place for anybody not payin-on-time
Rather be up in a six foot cell
Before i let another nigga get flagrant-with-mine
And we be takin all cash, no checks, so go cancel this
I know niggaz are so scandalous
The ones i bust i'ma show em nuff? on how many people
Thinkin that they can stand with this, sheeyit
I thought somebody told you, boy

[Treach]
No crooked cops pass my pocket or my peoples cause they evil to my people
Fuck procedure hope that ass can spell illegal search and seizure
Banged before ain't forgettin go 'head start all your crap
and get a boot from a lawsuit and a news conference at eleven
Routine stops how often? Tri day before last week (word?)
Always tryin to pull me over on these dark ass streets
Gave the war two blocks, two middle fingers like my nigga
Mr. Fuck-a-Cop Tupac so fuck them mug shots that you got
My Boo stops for nathin, know that Bonnie and Clyde
If that was then there'll be no Texas with you Tommy's inside
Chasin cases got that badge and know you runnin the place
But that ain't NAR' a fuckin reason to have them guns in my face
And your attitude's, like you ain't no had no nookie (go jerk off)
Shit, get your sights, get off that rookie shit
Let's have some fun, one on one, bite the badge, drop the gun
You did the same, thing we done, I got my niggaz on the run

I ain't the one! Fuck that! Get up, ah get up, no get down!
We'll just be niggaz on the run
I ain't the one! Fuck that! Get up, ah get up, no get down!
We'll just be niggaz on the run

Hold the heaters, want a war? Bless the butcher
Glad to meet you MOTHERFUCK THAT, nice to mush ya

Wanna hear this bump from New City, New Guinea to New York!

Say hot-damn, hot-damn, we wanna jamboree

Kaboom kaboom, the platoon came on in eight limbs and timbs
Broke rims, smoked sims, whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw, from who'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill, but I cut for the cars
Smokin' buddha with a hoota', get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters, leed a luga with duga
Some say modelin' and acting mean treach is selling

While I'm yelling, first a felon with my gat at ya melon
Hella heated, too ill for them to beat it
Most cheated, most weeded, most needed, you best believe it
Let's take the tapes jam for me, stand for me
You're damned to be without the Jamboree

Well oh damn, why don't you jamboree for me?

Let me lick you girl where the sun don't shine
I'm gonna sing, Treach gonna rhyme
Let me lick you girl where the sun don't shine

We can do it in the middle of the night, girl
We can do it on the beach in the sunlight
We can do it anywhere that you like, girl
Long as you do it, and do it, all night

We can do it in the middle of the night, girl
We can do it on the beach in the sunlight
We can do it anywhere that you like, girl
Long as you do it, and do it, all night

So how you like it, mama? In the morning coming out the sho-wah?
How bout the middle of the night, late after hours?
My powers be have her comin' hard to God, say good Muslim
From the way I crush the sun, the moon, and then the stars
Punisher's large like the planets
But if you make my dick hard like Janet

Then you can ride the Squad transit
Trizz Nathaniel to you, can you handle my crew?
Bend over by the fridge and hand me your brew
This is how we do, that's just how you do
Throw a hand in the air, and scream Trizz Power rules

That means you run train, with your whole damn crew, c'mon

As we leave the club, you know what's up
Thinkin' I'm gettin' some, damn! Was I so dumb?
Take her to the crib, thinkin' I'm gonn' live
But you got, all these excuses
How you've heard about me and you're not ready sexually
After you done teasin' me, you wanna leave
Say it isn't true, I'm so excited by you
Don't know what to do, you've given me the blues

Got the vessels in my testicles stopped on gridlock

Single don't mingle with ladies hearts, I'm a thief

And don't ask me for favors 'cuz it'll be just like pullin' teeth

Tell me before they gotta jail me and nail me

But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

You get her name and number then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)

How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at?

Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word

Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag

Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, WITH THIS HERE clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'M DOIN' BRAIDS, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut

I'm floatin' with Boogie Beat fishin' in a record ocean. Uh oh, I guess
it's going' down, not now, right now.
So I got down with the git down for Illtown. Figure it's the fine
fanny,
I miss my mammy.
And you could ask my uncle Randy, I'm grateful for my granny nanny
that's
my mother's mammy. Two tittle brothers with different fathers but we're
still family.
Forget how rough I had it, let's see how smooth it gets. Cuz I might
wind
up doing that same old cruddy shit.
Like clockin', sellin' rocks in my neighborhood. Back cockin',
buckshottin', your ass is shot.

CHORUS
It's workin', It's workin'
Party people if you're ready to rock let me hear you scream!

Verse 1: Treach

Too many of my people got time, it shows as crime unfolds
Many snap in a trap now new minds explode
Learn the ability to find their goals
Locked in a facility where time is froze
God knows the heart hurts to see no sky, just dirt
They give a man a cell quick before they give a man work
So we get into this black, this black cat syndrome
Grow older like there's no heart and no soul ingrown
Bars and cement instead of help for our people
Jails ain't nothin but the slave day sequel
Tryin to flee the trap of this nation
Seein penitentiary's the plan ta plant the new plantation
They say we'll take the animals from cottons and crops
straight to forgotten wit locks plottin to rottin our stocks
They draw a crooked line and wait for your foot ta fall under
Serving most of my brothers another football number
Judges look at our seeds, these brothers, like enemies

Check it out. I heard this track right here and I kind of felt a lil'
Somethin'. You know. It took my mind some place it ain't been.Search deep
Into another world. So I'm trying to figure out what make this world go
Round. For real. People are stressin'.

[Treach:]
Oh how oh how come everytime we have problems they nix none
Sending people to other plants when they still ain't fix this one
Victims from a distance prections of affliction
Some faction cause frictions fractions need fixinng
Mixing making music man to make it work
Some sticking shakin' bruisin' damn just ta brake a purse
It's worse misguided some guttered locked on the block
Cause the cops can't be trusted
Busted trusted frustrated frustrations of no more patience
Insides are cold and vacant check how we lay it
Why when we speak they try to stifle our breath
Cock a rifle to chest
Then ya have the party of your life at your death
Oh I wanna know I wanna know
Oh why, oh why is it the good that have to go

Crews will conquer as tough as Tonka now I got one

State of shock, it's a greater plot that made us stop

Ken Boogie just hit me on the horn in California
Born in Fort July Fourth you're sworn to bangin' and warrin'

Caution - courage what I bring when I approach this
Punks stays focused notice devotions and commotion's of cruddy's corrosive

Falling through the earth with a burst first for ya
Clapping ya hands now we must say errah!
For sure, but I am still thirsty, oh meercy!
It's worse see, come firs see, oh curse me! it's jersey!
Slappin' through the skins now a trends backin' in
Broader than broad street backed by mac 10's
No lights skip the cameras we haul action in.
Its naughty plannin' an orgy, already back again.
Kay's trackin' this so clicks clap to this as we rap to this
Hoochies pop their coochies and slap their hips
Even when in texas with no gear troopin'
That's when I find the baddest broads in houston boostin'
Breakdown feel the party
Put your hands together everybody
All the ladies in the house I call the honies first
Cause it's pure and ya sure, sure ta get your money's worth
So just...

Clap your hands this evening, come on y'all say it's alright [4x]

Open that kitty, pretty, let me write it in graffitti
Ya name sunshine, baby, been known by the glow in your panties, sweetie
Your poonany is screaming 'Feed me' so please me, uh
Free me, don't tease me, touch your toes and kiss your knees, ease
up in it, not minutes try sections of half 'n' hours
We'll be on every end of your house like it was ours
And you ain't gotta suggest respect sunshine, can't get less
I'll affect every part that your man neglects
I've been observing how your curving
Campaigning for a serving now see, I got that pretty kitty purring

We're on wax and it concerns ya that's make us eternal like a picture
Ya bitch ya, I'll fix ya, raise a rapture ripped ya scripture
I'll mac a meal infact until I stack the bills ta rack the skills

No trouble, I'll bust your bubble then leave you for ruin
Such come a dime a dozen, fuck some
You lost the race by a dick slut's cum cos nuts won
What fun freaking it frequently, freak wit me, slick ta freak quick
Your girl's poonany's packed like tha freaknic
We get redicu-down-diculous and devious, believe me bitch
Now your fucking soul ain't so mischevious
Diss who? We're the hip-hop rap pounder founder
Ricocheting PM to AM, frying freestyle flounders
big as bouncers
Ounce ta ounces

[Intro:]
Check it out. I heard this track right here and I kind of felt a lil'
Somethin'. You know. It took my mind some place it ain't been.Search deep
Into another world. So I'm trying to figure out what make this world go
Round. For real. People are stressin'.

[Treach:]
Oh how oh how come everytime we have problems they nix none
Sending people to other plants when they still ain't fix this one
Victims from a distance prections of affliction
Some faction cause frictions fractions need fixinng
Mixing making music man to make it work
Some sticking shakin' bruisin' damn just ta brake a purse
It's worse misguided some guttered locked on the block
Cause the cops can't be trusted
Busted trusted frustrated frustrations of no more patience
Insides are cold and vacant check how we lay it
Why when we speak they try to stifle our breath
Cock a rifle to chest
Then ya have the party of your life at your death
Oh I wanna know I wanna know
Oh why, oh why is it the good that have to go

Openin' up a can of clash clicks six-packs of ass whips, pints
and fifths of asses, burnt to ashes
You've been spined, twisted, blistered and spun up in and lifted
shit boy ya free paper bum it's called I got connections, like Poonanny to erections
I saw selected sets son for my selection stretchin' sections etchin' and sketchin'
to revive, reset and then set inspections
for the wet ones to the next ones, yes one, step son and get one
Comin' from behind is the line yours for a nine war
Walk nigga mind yours, of crime wars will find yours
The hot one will spot one, shock one and stop one
Crews will conquer as tough as Tonka now I got one

(Chorus)
I got connections, huh, huh, no question, huh
I got connections; I get that ass stuck like glue

State of shock, it's a greater plot that made us stop
the thunder from with under will make the whole of cradle rock, hah
Ken Boogie just hit me on the horn in California
Born in Fort July Fourth you're sworn to bangin' and warrin'
Road Dawgs you assume right first draft kick

Caution - courage what I bring when I approach this

The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it

Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

It's gonna be alright, you gotta believe dat

Dear God times are changing and the weather got hot
Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac

I was sittin' here lookin' at your picture my nigga
Puttin' hash with the weed wit a mixture of liquor
We can't kick it you ain't wit us is the shit I can't figure
Nigga I miss ya this thug gonna miss ya till I'm wit cha'

It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Doesn't even seem like 7 years passed
Both rodies now homies out the hood on the scene
You did the Humpty with the u I did the walk wit the queen

Was a dream smokin' and drinkin?
Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coleseums
[Unverified] the flip up make them lift they shit up
Get it the get up lift the trix up and switch up

Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gonna mourn you till I join you

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in God we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you 'til I join you 'cause I'll keep in touch

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in God we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you 'til I join you 'cause I'll keep in touch

We was two lil' niggas both skinny and broke
Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news
You was over in New York to film this movie called juice

Called you back up you told me pack up
Me and you and stretch could shack up
The thug luv back up the act up
Shock G and Hakeem would call and fuss

(Intro)
Smooth it out
This is a story about the drifter
Who waited through the worst for the best in crosstown
Who never planned on havin' so dick
Why me, huh?

(Chorus)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

(Verse 1)
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where ANYWAY I didN'T pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, WITH THIS HERE clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'M DOIN' BRAIDS, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none

OPP how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

Intro: Queen Latifah

Mercifully, mercifully, mercifully massacre, Naughty By Nature
Thru it ever time, comin at a dance
My man Treacherous MC, go on, let the saxophone man play a little
Make it lovely

Verse 1: Treach

You got beef, well what we do, talk to the bunny, sunny
He's the man, Bugs the thug wit the money
Funny that you should mention as my family, they covered
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together
No matter what your whatever, endeavour, find us better
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rollin spreads
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya
head
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago
Witta new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come

Chorus: Queen Latifah

Everytime they comin at the dance, what you know
It's time for rum, man, yeah man

Intro: Kay Gee

*phone dialling*
(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

Verse 1: Treach

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been thru more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm runnin this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted cos you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin too gay, you're tryin too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, yup!

Chorus:

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

Verse 1: Treach

Too many of my people got time, it shows as crime unfolds
Many snap in a trap now new minds explode
Learn the ability to find their goals
Locked in a facility where time is froze
God knows the heart hurts to see no sky, just dirt
They give a man a cell quick before they give a man work
So we get into this black, this black cat syndrome
Grow older like there's no heart and no soul ingrown
Bars and cement instead of help for our people
Jails ain't nothin but the slave day sequel
Tryin to flee the trap of this nation
Seein penitentiary's the plan ta plant the new plantation
They say we'll take the animals from cottons and crops
straight to forgotten wit locks plottin to rottin our stocks
They draw a crooked line and wait for your foot ta fall under
Serving most of my brothers another football number
Judges look at our seeds, these brothers, like enemies
saying "We don't need G's", giving out years like free cheese
Free please, nigga, ain't no freedom
Who's locked up? Who's shot up? Who's strung out? Who's bleeding? Keep
reading
I'm here to explain the chain remain the same
maintain for the brothers and sisters locked

Chorus: The chain remains

Oh finally, finally (here we are)
And for good are the three, follow me (it ain't far)
Even though if it was, you could make it to the start
The enemies, do you know who they are? (there they are)

A devil with the dorags be walkin', now I had it up to there
Oh yeah, that's the last straw (the nature's back for)
Better than Disco (R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-round) Uh-Uh-Uh

Pin the tail on the junkie, find a false flavor
It's a new day to play with a neighbour
Freeze the MC's that wanna see thee
By now naugh-ty by nature by me

They want me to come and come up faster, that could be arranged
Dump the last of the matinee, 'cos they couldn't stand the damn rain
The pain's the same, the game remains mine
I got more hooks than a fish line

Bite the head off a snake
Chew up from the first to last break and shoot 'em in the face
Make way, (move), boy, you detest me! (Huh, huh, huh)
I seen your last porno flick, it ain't impress me

Wassup? Cuddle sport, here's a thought
(The only records that they got, are the records their crew bought)
Damn real B rock, get fienin, spunky
Pin the tail on the donkey

(Bring that beat back)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I do more poppin than a blockhead
Wreck the waxheads, I'm fed
(Go ahead, you retired tackhead)
Back to the fact of the track witha new thought

You couldn't smoke blunts witha match and a Newport
Here we go, we go, we go again, witha flow we know, we know it's in

Verse 1: Treach

This is somethin that I call the flow
Not many if any 'cept for Vinnie can say they know
In fact detracting that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro) you say cheeka boo
A name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga actor will do, ooh
Dressed to the best to impress but after they try take us in
Crook as a nigga, take a pistol, see who wants to be Naughty or nicest
Like ice is I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see whose hype is
Test the test the Treach to Treach address, the address:
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
Why to try to chrome, my style is just nonsense
M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-mackin so you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many are small should call
Naughty By Nature the creator of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way
This is how we play everyday all day

Verse 2: Treach

Yo yo hey yo
Havin a round of (? cadavva?), gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee
Hand to Gee the producer, me is loose off the claps ya see
That keeps you boogie'n happily
Voice ya opinion, it's the rhythm I'm lendin
The message I'm sendin from London to Linley
Girls are given a chance to get ya all pampered
Leave them ol' cramps in your pants then I belly dance her
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leavin em evil and seein em bein a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these call shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall darlin
Cos on the shrift and Naughty ain't waltzin
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knockin and poppin em up inside, they rockin dawn til dusk

Coming out the alleyways of illtown
Producer extraordinaire kaygee
Followed by the backbone, vinrock
And the last to fall onto this planet: me

Falling through the earth with a burst first for ya
Clapping ya hands now we must say errah!
For sure, but I am still thirsty, oh meercy!
It's worse see, come firs see, oh curse me! it's jersey!
Slappin' through the skins now a trends backin' in
Broader than broad street backed by mac 10's
No lights skip the cameras we haul action in.
Its naughty plannin' an orgy, already back again.
Kay's trackin' this so clicks clap to this as we rap to this
Hoochies pop their coochies and slap their hips
Even when in texas with no gear troopin'
That's when I find the baddest broads in houston boostin'
Breakdown feel the party
Put your hands together everybody
All the ladies in the house I call the honies first
Cause it's pure and ya sure, sure ta get your money's worth
So just...

Chorus
Clap your hands this evening, come on y'all say it's alright [4x]
Clap yo hands
To all my people on the left, clap to this
To all my people on the right, clap to this
To all my people on the top, clap to this
And in the front don't stop, clap to this

1: Treach

I'ma shine on, time to climb on
Stun me with R&B harmony
So far, first to the O-R
Hand the bill until paid is a coastguard
The sonar, sounds that will throw your
feet, to no more, no tour, show more
First ability, deeper agility
No harassment, pass the humility
A new style blessed with a few styles
Rhyme'll shine on, I'm on a new prowl
Clap your hands in the evening
Come on y'all, say "It's alright" before leavin
I like a party, overpumped and lovely
All who flow, show, you think you love me
Bow in the balcony, say "Owwwwww" for me (Owwwww)
Now dance, so shall we?
All night long to a long, good, strong song
Hug, the rhyme'll shine on much stronger
A tougher chart buster went tutta
Summer, been back thru another
Autumn, I'm callin ya all in
and fallin off like a soft man stallin
A party's live and it dies it when I'm gone
I'm born to see that the rhyme'll shine on

Get a little bit of taste of the bass to the face
In the place for anybody not payin' on time
Rather be up in a six foot cell
Before I let another nigga get flagrant with mine

And we be takin' all cash, no checks, so go cancel this
I know niggaz are so scandalous
The ones I bust I'ma show 'em nuff crugs on how many people
Thinkin' that they can stand with this, sheeyit

You're fuckin' with sixteen styles over sixteen bars
Sixteen car, man entourage

And when we get things started, I'm the hardest artist
Styles I flips retarded

But you never look my way (hey!)

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders

Yo, I told ya

And played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

Me and you and stretch could shack up
The thug luv back up the act up
Shock G and Hakeem would call and fuss

(Intro)
Smooth it out
This is a story about the drifter
Who waited through the worst for the best in crosstown
Who never planned on havin' so dick
Why me, huh?

(Chorus)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

(Verse 1)
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where ANYWAY I didN'T pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, WITH THIS HERE clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'M DOIN' BRAIDS, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold

O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple

It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) Who's down with OPP (Every last homie)

Fuck procedure hope that ass can spell illegal search and seizure
Banged before ain't forgettin go 'head start all your crap
and get a boot from a lawsuit and a news conference at eleven
Routine stops how often? Tri day before last week (word?)
Always tryin to pull me over on these dark ass streets
Gave the war two blocks, two middle fingers like my nigga
Mr. Fuck-a-Cop Tupac so fuck them mug shots that you got
My Boo stops for nathin, know that Bonnie and Clyde
If that was then there'll be no Texas with you Tommy's inside
Chasin cases got that badge and know you runnin the place
But that ain't NAR' a fuckin reason to have them guns in my face
And your attitude's, like you ain't no had no nookie (go jerk off)

Broke rims, smoked sims, whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw, from who'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill, but I cut for the cars
Smokin' buddha with a hoota', get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters, leed a luga with duga
Some say modelin' and acting mean treach is selling

While I'm yelling, first a felon with my gat at ya melon
Hella heated, too ill for them to beat it
Most cheated, most weeded, most needed, you best believe it

And many people really ain't worth the mentionin
Thugs, me hugs, and plus a little gentle friend
Or the mentals if I wile I get antetion then
Do my drama from court to case
While others turn they back I turn my hate to faith
Thats why I'm here, but boo's, any place or date
If theres tear in my eyes you come to dry my face
Now thats deep, y'all turned from my fans to my friends
After the past, I didnt think I could stand it again
On the streets, me and Miny wonderin shall I kill
I do for all, when will someone ask me how I feel?
Ladies, if youre down and my pics on youre wall
Just pop in this song and wont let you fall
To all my ladies, got ya letters and I love you to death
Now I appreciate the breath that the dear lord left

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin down and put 'em back on they feet?

Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?

Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?

But you couldn't make my day (hey!)

But you never look my way (hey!)

And played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks

Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome

Army with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em

OPP how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?

Who's down with OPP?

Verse One: Treach

Hey, you could smoke a spliff with a cliff
But there's still no mountain hiiiigh enough, or wide enough to touch
The naughty nappy nasty nigga the nasty trashy hoe happy pappy
That's Happi to be Nappi
Me and Vin rock when spots hit flocks
and groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I'm rollin my hair-do don't
Win I will I got wantin competition ain't dope
Beat ya break ya broke ya smoke ya take ya
Send you to your little group on mute, sooner or later
When wanna flip, tell em full semi half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty naughty hi bye greater than nature while I
shin slam the flim flim and then jam
You can run but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

Penetration 'til the morning light
It's alright girl, I'll rock your world
And make you wish for the next night
I got what you're waiting for

Now here we go

Of Henney and Remy, the gang and Uncle Vinnie
Get plenty more like Demi

Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where ANYWAY I didN'T pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, WITH THIS HERE clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'M DOIN' BRAIDS, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none

Slick consider this how I lick it and then fan it
Pick, rub and ran it how I run it yeah I ran it
And it ran frantic rub put new poonanie panic

Plan it, as a package, pick it and then pack it
Trick it and attract it, throw a crack then catch it
Quick as richocet rabbit, quick 'cause it's a habit
To rap it as fast as another brother runnin' rapid

Never call you sir
Who gives a damn if you Mix Alot?
East coast gets the props

Baby ain't got back, baby got black
That's why you see

1: Treach

My thoughts are thundering, tumblin
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling ta mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary, as I roll reality thru galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of oiu
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
from Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
lifers, Rikers ta foesome
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening to slow
I'm abrupting construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin 'bout an obstruction or turning something of nothing
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin me up

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest

Nevertheless still screamin' they thugs
If crap don't work for the number 1

Ain't a damn thing ceasin, if my bankroll decreasin'
Open up shop at the first of the month

You can look at my life and call me bad
But nigga, you read me wrong
And, nigga, I be head over heels 'til I get fifty mill or mo'
If it's this dough these niggas wanna kill me for
Well I refuse to be broke
I'm contemplatin' murder on the government
Desporito be the motto
All shit be hard to swallow be ready for war if you follow
Atend hut, two, three, fo'

Take it from a thug by nature, by nature

Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

Followed by the backbone, VinRock
And the last to fall onto this planet, me

Falling through the earth with a burst first for ya
Clapping ya hands now we must say, errah
For sure, but I am still thirsty, oh mercy
It's worse see, come firs see, oh curse me, it's Jersey

Slappin' through the skins now a trends backin' in
Broader than Broad Street backed by Mac 10's
No lights skip the cameras we haul action in
It's Naughty plannin' an orgy, already back again

Kay's trackin' this so clicks clap to this as we rap to this
Hoochies pop their coochies and slap their hips
Even when in Texas with no gear troopin'
That's when I find the baddest broads in Houston boostin'

Breakdown feel the party
Put your hands together everybody
All the ladies in the house, I call the honies, first
'Cause it's pure and ya sure ta get your money's worth so just

(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

Verse 1: Treach

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been thru more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm runnin this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted cos you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin too gay, you're tryin too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, yup!

Chorus:

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

My man Treacherous MC, go on, let the saxophone man play a little
Make it lovely

You got beef, well what we do, talk to the bunny, sunny

Funny that you should mention as my family, they covered
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together
No matter what your whatever, endeavour, find us better
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rollin spreads
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya
head
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago
Witta new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done

Hush, don't speak

Keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah
Because your theories catch fire

I can't find
Your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech
It's tiring, enough is enough!

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing

Because if my heart can't stop it
I find a way to block it
I go la, la, la...

Sometimes because of jealousy and the intent to demise
Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere

Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you 'til I join you

See what started as a family forest

I give ya mother-mm-mm, goose pimples goose pimples
Ain't the last brother passed over
I be the bastard of the year, y'know that calf punchin back brother
N-A-U-G-H, T-Y, B-Y
Na-Na-Na, NATURE, not cause I hate ya
Master the matress, flip an' go backwards
One kiss on your cheek will make you backflip to Chadwick

[Chorus: 3LW]
It feels good to ya (good to ya)
Let me see how you rock wit it (rock wit it)
Ride the beat baby, drop wit it (drop wit it)
And don't worry bout a damn thang (and don't worry bout a damn thang)
It feels good to ya (good to ya)

Army with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em

OPP how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?

Who's down with OPP?

You down with OPP?

Verse One: Treach

Hey, you could smoke a spliff with a cliff
But there's still no mountain hiiiigh enough, or wide enough to touch
The naughty nappy nasty nigga the nasty trashy hoe happy pappy
That's Happi to be Nappi
Me and Vin rock when spots hit flocks
and groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I'm rollin my hair-do don't
Win I will I got wantin competition ain't dope
Beat ya break ya broke ya smoke ya take ya
Send you to your little group on mute, sooner or later
When wanna flip, tell em full semi half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty naughty hi bye greater than nature while I
shin slam the flim flim and then jam
You can run but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

(Intro)
Smooth it out
This is a story about the drifter
Who waited through the worst for the best in crosstown
Who never planned on havin' so dick
Why me, huh?

(Chorus)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

(Verse 1)
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where ANYWAY I didN'T pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, WITH THIS HERE clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'M DOIN' BRAIDS, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none

*phone dialling*
(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

Verse 1: Treach

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been thru more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm runnin this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted cos you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin too gay, you're tryin too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, yup!

Chorus:

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

Intro: Queen Latifah

Mercifully, mercifully, mercifully massacre, Naughty By Nature
Thru it ever time, comin at a dance
My man Treacherous MC, go on, let the saxophone man play a little
Make it lovely

Verse 1: Treach

You got beef, well what we do, talk to the bunny, sunny
He's the man, Bugs the thug wit the money
Funny that you should mention as my family, they covered
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together
No matter what your whatever, endeavour, find us better
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rollin spreads
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya
head
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago
Witta new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come

Chorus: Queen Latifah

Everytime they comin at the dance, what you know
It's time for rum, man, yeah man

Verse 1: Treach

This is somethin that I call the flow
Not many if any 'cept for Vinnie can say they know
In fact detracting that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro) you say cheeka boo
A name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga actor will do, ooh
Dressed to the best to impress but after they try take us in
Crook as a nigga, take a pistol, see who wants to be Naughty or nicest
Like ice is I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see whose hype is
Test the test the Treach to Treach address, the address:
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
Why to try to chrome, my style is just nonsense
M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-mackin so you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many are small should call
Naughty By Nature the creator of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way
This is how we play everyday all day

Verse 2: Treach

Yo yo hey yo
Havin a round of (? cadavva?), gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee
Hand to Gee the producer, me is loose off the claps ya see
That keeps you boogie'n happily
Voice ya opinion, it's the rhythm I'm lendin
The message I'm sendin from London to Linley
Girls are given a chance to get ya all pampered
Leave them ol' cramps in your pants then I belly dance her
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leavin em evil and seein em bein a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these call shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall darlin
Cos on the shrift and Naughty ain't waltzin
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knockin and poppin em up inside, they rockin dawn til dusk

Intro: Treach

There are too many overnight MC's but one
And too many wacked who haven't paid dues
You have now entered the path of the Flavor Unit
and we are Naughty By Nature, and we will just do, by terminating you

Verse 1: Treach

I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fuckin joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chung Li's temple I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losin is small talk
I ain't a punk, I'll slot'cha, furthermore I don't scare chief
The reason I called you 'pussy' cos you are what you eat, each
look is a little closer to the centre of a blowpipe
Don't speak when I am talkin, this is my fuckin sho-op
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you be funky, while
you're smilin backstage doin mother, ugh, doggystyle
Hot, wild, raw, whores' still suave
*laughter* Check out this style that I've
soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
semi-social, never seem sloppy
See silly slappin suckers, sorry saps and slouchers
Straps slammin stouch, mackin this mass is savvy
We see so-so-songs and some shots, so
snaps steppin separate, start slowly, go solo

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
And played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the grill town ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for hip hop
This is hip hop of today

Got a few things that's on my mind
So nigga gon' listen up while I free it
Whatever's needed, I'ma get it
And if I wanna get weeded, I'ma hit it

Nevertheless still screamin' they thugs
If crap don't work for the number 1

Ain't a damn thing ceasin, if my bankroll decreasin'
Open up shop at the first of the month

until I'm done up, dead and gone
You can look at my life and call me bad
But nigga, you read me wrong
And, nigga, I be head over heels 'til I get fifty mill or mo'
If it's this dough these niggas wanna kill me for
Well I refuse to be broke
I'm contemplatin' murder on the government
Desporito be the motto
All shit be hard to swallow be ready for war if you follow
Atend hut, two, three, fo'
Soldiers get your paper
Nigga, you die if you a hater
Take it from a thug by nature, by nature

To rap it as fast as another brother runnin' rapid

Never call you sir
Who gives a damn if you Mix Alot?

Baby ain't got back, baby got black

1: Treach

My thoughts are thundering, tumblin
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling ta mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary, as I roll reality thru galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of oiu
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
from Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
lifers, Rikers ta foesome
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening to slow
I'm abrupting construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin 'bout an obstruction or turning something of nothing
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin me up

Philly niggas are the craziest

Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac

It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Doesn't even seem like 7 years passed

You did the Humpty with the u I did the walk wit the queen

Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coleseums

Get it the get up lift the trix up and switch up

Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gonna mourn you till I join you

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in God we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you 'til I join you 'cause I'll keep in touch

Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news

Because your theories catch fire

Your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech
It's tiring, enough is enough!

I'm covering my ears like a kid

I find a way to block it

Sometimes because of jealousy and the intent to demise
Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere

Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you 'til I join you

You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP?
(Every last homie)

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?

Verse One: Treach

Hey, you could smoke a spliff with a cliff
But there's still no mountain hiiiigh enough, or wide enough to touch
The naughty nappy nasty nigga the nasty trashy hoe happy pappy
That's Happi to be Nappi
Me and Vin rock when spots hit flocks
and groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I'm rollin my hair-do don't
Win I will I got wantin competition ain't dope
Beat ya break ya broke ya smoke ya take ya
Send you to your little group on mute, sooner or later
When wanna flip, tell em full semi half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty naughty hi bye greater than nature while I
shin slam the flim flim and then jam
You can run but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

Chorus: repeat 2X

(Intro)
Smooth it out
This is a story about the drifter
Who waited through the worst for the best in crosstown
Who never planned on havin' so dick
Why me, huh?

(Chorus)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

(Verse 1)
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where ANYWAY I didN'T pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, WITH THIS HERE clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'M DOIN' BRAIDS, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none

Intro: Kay Gee

*phone dialling*
(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

Verse 1: Treach

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been thru more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm runnin this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted cos you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin too gay, you're tryin too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, yup!

Chorus:

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

Intro: Queen Latifah

Mercifully, mercifully, mercifully massacre, Naughty By Nature
Thru it ever time, comin at a dance
My man Treacherous MC, go on, let the saxophone man play a little
Make it lovely

Verse 1: Treach

You got beef, well what we do, talk to the bunny, sunny
He's the man, Bugs the thug wit the money
Funny that you should mention as my family, they covered
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together
No matter what your whatever, endeavour, find us better
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rollin spreads
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya
head
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago
Witta new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come

Chorus: Queen Latifah

Everytime they comin at the dance, what you know
It's time for rum, man, yeah man

Verse 1: Treach

This is somethin that I call the flow
Not many if any 'cept for Vinnie can say they know
In fact detracting that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro) you say cheeka boo
A name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga actor will do, ooh
Dressed to the best to impress but after they try take us in
Crook as a nigga, take a pistol, see who wants to be Naughty or nicest
Like ice is I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see whose hype is
Test the test the Treach to Treach address, the address:
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
Why to try to chrome, my style is just nonsense
M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-mackin so you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many are small should call
Naughty By Nature the creator of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way
This is how we play everyday all day

Verse 2: Treach

Yo yo hey yo
Havin a round of (? cadavva?), gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee
Hand to Gee the producer, me is loose off the claps ya see
That keeps you boogie'n happily
Voice ya opinion, it's the rhythm I'm lendin
The message I'm sendin from London to Linley
Girls are given a chance to get ya all pampered
Leave them ol' cramps in your pants then I belly dance her
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leavin em evil and seein em bein a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these call shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall darlin
Cos on the shrift and Naughty ain't waltzin
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knockin and poppin em up inside, they rockin dawn til dusk

Known to kill, dunk skills, erupt
You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck'

I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill ya, I'ma leave ya body across 110th Street
My tactics are drastic and real fast
I tie one to a truck and go drag ya ass

I'm more than a threat, I'm a problem
To hell with cotton, watch out when I come to Harlem
So don't whisper or make a sound or croak
Shit ya prop, go straight back down ya throat

Yoke the Joker!
*laughter*

Intro: Treach

There are too many overnight MC's but one
And too many wacked who haven't paid dues
You have now entered the path of the Flavor Unit
and we are Naughty By Nature, and we will just do, by terminating you

Verse 1: Treach

I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fuckin joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chung Li's temple I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losin is small talk
I ain't a punk, I'll slot'cha, furthermore I don't scare chief
The reason I called you 'pussy' cos you are what you eat, each
look is a little closer to the centre of a blowpipe
Don't speak when I am talkin, this is my fuckin sho-op
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you be funky, while
you're smilin backstage doin mother, ugh, doggystyle
Hot, wild, raw, whores' still suave
*laughter* Check out this style that I've
soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
semi-social, never seem sloppy
See silly slappin suckers, sorry saps and slouchers
Straps slammin stouch, mackin this mass is savvy
We see so-so-songs and some shots, so
snaps steppin separate, start slowly, go solo

Give it up for naughty by nature

Hip hop hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
And played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the grill town ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for hip hop
This is hip hop of today
I give props to
So hip hop hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip hop hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

I'm callin' my shots just how I see it, believe it
My nigga, I G it
Got a few things that's on my mind
So nigga gon' listen up while I free it
Whatever's needed, I'ma get it
And if I wanna get weeded, I'ma hit it
All of these dramas, niggas ain't sayin' they did it
Lil Lay commited (damn right)
Niggas is bucklin' up under pressure
Nevertheless still screamin' they thugs
If crap don't work for the number 1
I'm packin' my heat, sellin' more drugs
Ain't a damn thing ceasin, if my bankroll decreasin'
Open up shop at the first of the month
nigga, continue my creepin' on a come up
until I'm done up, dead and gone
You can look at my life and call me bad
But nigga, you read me wrong
And, nigga, I be head over heels 'til I get fifty mill or mo'
If it's this dough these niggas wanna kill me for
Well I refuse to be broke
I'm contemplatin' murder on the government
Desporito be the motto
All shit be hard to swallow be ready for war if you follow
Atend hut, two, three, fo'
Soldiers get your paper
Nigga, you die if you a hater
Take it from a thug by nature, by nature

(Chorus)x4
Cause I'm a thug by nature, thug by nature, yeah, yeah

Pick, rub and ran it how I run it yeah I ran it
And it ran frantic rub put new poonanie panic

Plan it, as a package, pick it and then pack it
Trick it and attract it, throw a crack then catch it
Quick as richocet rabbit, quick 'cause it's a habit
To rap it as fast as another brother runnin' rapid

Never call you sir
Who gives a damn if you Mix Alot?
East coast gets the props
Producers rock your knot
Baby ain't got back, baby got black
That's why you see
The black baby and you respect that

Checka check it out, on and on and on, rock on
To the breaka breaka dawn it's on

1: Treach

My thoughts are thundering, tumblin
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling ta mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary, as I roll reality thru galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of oiu
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
from Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
lifers, Rikers ta foesome
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening to slow
I'm abrupting construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin 'bout an obstruction or turning something of nothing
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin me up

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest
Utah niggas are the craziest

It's gonna be alright, you gotta believe dat

Dear God times are changing and the weather got hot
Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac

I was sittin' here lookin' at your picture my nigga
Puttin' hash with the weed wit a mixture of liquor
We can't kick it you ain't wit us is the shit I can't figure
Nigga I miss ya this thug gonna miss ya till I'm wit cha'

It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Doesn't even seem like 7 years passed
Both rodies now homies out the hood on the scene
You did the Humpty with the u I did the walk wit the queen

Was a dream smokin' and drinkin?
Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coleseums
[Unverified] the flip up make them lift they shit up
Get it the get up lift the trix up and switch up

Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gonna mourn you till I join you

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in God we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you 'til I join you 'cause I'll keep in touch

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in God we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you 'til I join you 'cause I'll keep in touch

We was two lil' niggas both skinny and broke
Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news
You was over in New York to film this movie called juice

Called you back up you told me pack up
