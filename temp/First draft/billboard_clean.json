corridor of red marble, through which one can see a view of padua; a large canopy is set  with three thrones, one a little lower than the others; the ceiling is made of long gilded beams; furniture of the period, chairs covered with gilt leather, and buffets set with gold and silver plate, and chests painted with mythological scenes. a number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down into the street below; from the street comes the roar of a mob and cries of 'death to the duke': after a little interval enter the duke very calmly; he is leaning on the arm of guido ferranti; with him enters also the lord cardinal; the mob still shouting.\n\nduke\nno, my lord cardinal, i weary of her!\nwhy, she is worse than ugly, she is good.\n\nmaffio\n\nyour grace, there are two thousand people there\nwho every moment grow more clamorous.\n\nduke\ntut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!\npeople who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;\nthe only men i fear are

you.\n\n\n\ncardinal\ni beseech your grace\nto listen to their grievances.\n\nduke\n\nay! the peaches\nare not so big this year as they were last.\ni crave your pardon, my lord cardinal,\ni thought you spake of peaches.\n\nwhat is that?\n\nguido\n\nthe duchess has gone forth into the square,\nand stands between the people and the guard,\nand will not let them shoot.\n\nduke\nthe devil take her!\n\nguido\n\nand followed by a dozen of the citizens\nhas come into the palace.\n\nduke\n\nby saint james,\nour duchess waxes bold!\n\nbardi\nhere comes the duchess.\n\nduke\nshut that door there; this morning air is cold.\n\n\n\nduchess\n\ni do beseech your grace to give us audience.\n\nduke\nwhat are these grievances?\n\nduchess\nalas, my lord,\nsuch common things as neither you nor i,\nnor

chaff.\n\nduke\nand very good food too,\ni give it to my horses.\n\nduchess\n\nthey say the water,\nset in the public cisterns for their use,\n\nto stagnant pools and muddy puddles

wine.\n\nduke\nthen you should bless the taxes\nwhich make you temperate.\n\nduchess\nthink, while we sit\nin gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty\ncreeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives\ncuts the warm throats of children stealthily\nand no word said.\n\nthird citizen\nay! marry, that is true,\nmy little son died yesternight from hunger;\nhe was but six years old; i am so poor,\ni cannot bury him.\n\nduke\nif you are poor,\nare you not blessed in that? why, poverty\nis one of the christian virtues,\n\nis it not?\ni know, lord cardinal, you have great revenues,\nrich abbey-lands, and tithes, and large estates\nfor preaching voluntary poverty.\n\nduchess\nnay but, my lord the duke, be generous;\nwhile we sit here within a noble house\n[with shaded porticoes against the sun,\nand walls and roofs to keep the winter out],\nthere are many citizens of padua\nwho in vile tenements live so full of holes,\nthat the chill rain, the snow, and the rude blast,\nare tenants also with them; others sleep\nunder the arches of the public bridges\nall through the autumn nights, till the wet mist\nstiffens their limbs, and fevers come, and so -\n\nduke\nand so they go to

christian also to be kind,\nand there seem many evils in this town,\nwhich in your wisdom might your grace reform.\n\nfirst citizen\nwhat is that word reform? what does it mean?\n\nsecond citizen\nmarry, it means leaving things as they are; i like it not.\n\nduke\nreform lord cardinal, did you say reform?\nthere is a man in germany called luther,\nwho would reform the holy catholic church.\nhave you not made him heretic, and uttered\nanathema, maranatha, against him?\n\ncardinal\n\nhe would have led the sheep out of the fold,\nwe do but ask of you to feed the

citizen\nmarry, he will lighten the taxes!\n\nsecond citizen\nor a dole of bread, think you, for each man?\n\nduke\nthat, on next sunday, the lord cardinal\nshall, after holy mass, preach you a sermon\nupon the beauty of obedience.\n\n\nfirst citizen\ni' faith, that will not fill our stomachs!\n\nsecond citizen\na sermon is but a sorry sauce, when\nyou have nothing to eat with

fellow's love\ntouches me much. \ngo!  \nthis is the way, my lords,\nyou can buy popularity nowadays.\noh, we are nothing if not democratic!\n\nwell, madam,\nyou spread rebellion 'midst our citizens.\n\nduchess\nmy lord, the poor have rights you cannot touch,\nthe right to pity, and the right to mercy.\n\nduke\nso, so, you argue with me? this is she,\nthe gentle duchess for whose hand i yielded\nthree of the fairest towns in italy,\npisa, and genoa, and orvieto.\n\nduchess\npromised, my lord, in that matter\nbrake you your word as ever.\n\nduke\nyou wrong us, madam,\nthere were state reasons.\n\nduchess\nwhat state reasons are there\nfor breaking holy promises to a state?\n\nduke\nthere are wild boars at pisa in a forest\n when i promised pisa\nunto your noble and most trusting father,\ni had forgotten there was hunting there.\nat genoa they say,\nindeed i doubt them not, that the red mullet\nruns larger in the harbour of that town\nthan anywhere in italy.\n\nyou, my lord,\nwhose gluttonous appetite is your only god,\ncould satisfy our duchess on that point.\n\nduchess\nand orvieto?\n\nduke\n\ni cannot now recall\nwhy i did not surrender orvieto\naccording to the word of my contract.\nmaybe it was because i did not choose.\n\nwhy look you, madam, you are here alone;\n'tis many a dusty league to your grey france,\nand even there your father barely keeps\na hundred ragged squires for his court.\nwhat hope have you, i say? which of these lords\nand noble gentlemen of padua\nstands by your side.\n\nduchess\nthere is not one.\n\n\n\nduke\nnor shall be,\n listen, madam,\nbeing mine own, you shall do as i will,\nand if it be my will you keep the house,\nwhy then, this palace shall your prison be;\nand if it be my will you walk abroad,\nwhy, you shall take the air from morn to night.\n\nduchess\nsir, by what right -?\n\nduke\nmadam, my second duchess\n her monument\nlies in the chapel of bartholomew,\nwrought in red marble; very beautiful.\nguido, your arm. come, gentlemen, let us go\nand spur our falcons for the mid-day chase.\nbethink you, madam, you are here alone.\n\n\nduchess\n\nthe duke said rightly that i was alone;\ndeserted, and dishonoured, and defamed,\nstood ever woman so alone indeed?\nmen when they woo us call us pretty children,\ntell us we have not wit to make our lives,\nand so they mar them for us. did i say woo?\nwe are their chattels, and their common slaves,\nless dear than the poor hound that licks their hand,\nless fondled than the hawk upon their wrist.\nwoo, did i say? bought rather, sold and bartered,\nour very bodies being merchandise.\ni know it is the general lot of women,\neach miserably mated to some man\n\nthat it is general makes it not less bitter.\ni think i never heard a woman laugh,\nlaugh for pure merriment, except one woman,\nthat was at night time, in the public streets.\npoor soul, she walked with painted lips, and wore\n i would not laugh like her;\nno, death were better.\n\no mary mother, with your sweet pale face\nbending between the little angel heads\nthat hover round you, have you no help for me?\nmother of god, have you no help for me?\n\nguido\ni can endure no longer.\nthis is my love, and i will speak to her.\nlady, am i a stranger to your prayers?\n\nduchess\n\nnone but the wretched needs my prayers, my lord.\n\nguido\nthen must i need them, lady.\n\nduchess\nhow is that?\ndoes not the duke show thee sufficient honour?\n\nguido\nyour grace, i lack no favours from the duke,\nwhom my soul loathes as i loathe wickedness,\nbut come to proffer on my bended knees,\nmy loyal service to thee unto death.\n\nduchess\nalas! i am so fallen in estate\ni can but give thee a poor meed of thanks.\n\nguido\n\nhast thou no love to give me?\n\no dear saint,\nif i have been too daring, pardon me!\nthy beauty sets my boyish blood aflame,\nand, when my reverent lips touch thy white hand,\neach little nerve with such wild passion thrills\nthat there is nothing which i would not do\nto gain thy love. \nbid me reach forth and pluck\nperilous honour from the lion's jaws,\nand i will wrestle with the nemean beast\non the bare desert! fling to the cave of war\na gaud, a ribbon, a dead flower, something\nthat once has touched thee, and i'll bring it back\nthough all the hosts of christendom were there,\ninviolate again! ay, more than this,\nset me to scale the pallid white-faced cliffs\nof mighty england, and from that arrogant shield\nwill i raze out the lilies of your france\nwhich england, that sea-lion of the sea,\nhath taken from her!\no dear beatrice,\ndrive me not from thy presence! without thee\nthe heavy minutes crawl with feet of lead,\nbut, while i look upon thy loveliness,\nthe hours fly like winged mercuries\nand leave existence golden.\n\nduchess\ni did not think\n do you indeed\nlove me so much as now you say you do?\n\nguido\nask of the sea-bird if it loves the sea,\nask of the roses if they love the rain,\nask of the little lark, that will not sing\ntill day break,-\nand yet, these are but empty images,\nmere shadows of my love, which is a fire\nso great that all the waters of the main\ncan not avail to quench it. will you not speak?\n\nduchess\ni hardly know what i should say to you.\n\nguido\nwill you not say you love me?\n\nduchess\nis that my lesson?\nmust i say all at once? 'twere a good lesson\nif i did love you, sir; but, if i do not,\nwhat shall i say then?\n\nguido\nif you do not love me,\nsay, none the less, you do, for on your tongue\nfalsehood for very shame would turn to truth.\n\nduchess\nwhat if i do not speak at all? they say\nlovers are happiest when they are in doubt\n\nguido\nnay, doubt would kill me, and if i must die,\nwhy, let me die for joy and not for doubt.\noh, tell me may i stay, or must i go?\n\nduchess\ni would not have you either stay or go;\nfor if you stay you steal my love from me,\nand if you go you take my love away.\nguido, though all the morning stars could sing\nthey could not tell the measure of my love.\ni love you, guido.\n\nguido\n\noh, do not cease at all;\ni thought the nightingale sang but at night;\nor if thou needst must cease, then let my lips\ntouch the sweet lips that can such music make.\n\nduchess\nto touch my lips is not to touch my heart.\n\nguido\ndo you close that against me?\n\nduchess\nalas! my lord,\n the first day that i saw you\ni let you take my heart away from me;\nunwilling thief, that without meaning it\ndid break into my fenced treasury\nand filch my jewel from it! o strange theft,\nwhich made you richer though you knew it not,\nand left me poorer, and yet glad of it!\n\nguido\n\no love, love, love! nay, sweet, lift up your head,\nlet me unlock those little scarlet doors\nthat shut in music, let me dive for coral\nin your red lips, and i'll bear back a prize\nricher than all the gold the gryphon guards\nin rude armenia.\n\nduchess\nyou are my lord,\nand what i have is yours, and what i have not\nyour fancy lends me, like a prodigal\nspending its wealth on what is nothing worth.\n\n\nguido\n\nthe gentle violet hides beneath its leaf\nand is afraid to look at the great sun\nfor fear of too much splendour, but my eyes,\no daring eyes! are grown so venturous\nthat like fixed stars they stand, gazing at you,\nand surfeit sense with beauty.\n\nduchess\ndear love, i would\nyou could look upon me ever, for your eyes\nare polished mirrors, and when i peer\ninto those mirrors i can see myself,\nand so i know my image lives in you.\n\nguido\n\nstand still, thou hurrying orb in the high heavens,\nand make this hour immortal! \n\nduchess\nsit down here,\n yes, just so, sweet,\nthat i may run my fingers through your hair,\nand see your face turn upwards like a flower\nto meet my kiss.\nhave you not sometimes noted,\nwhen we unlock some long-disus\u00e9d room\nwith heavy dust and soiling mildew filled,\nwhere never foot of man has come for years,\nand from the windows take the rusty bar,\nand fling the broken shutters to the air,\nand let the bright sun in, how the good sun\nturns every grimy particle of dust\ninto a little thing of dancing gold?\nguido, my heart is that long-empty room,\nbut you have let love in, and with its gold\ngilded all life. do you not think that love\nfills up the sum of life?\n\nguido\nay! without love\nlife is no better than the unhewn stone\nwhich in the quarry lies, before the sculptor\nhas set the god within it. without love\nlife is as silent as the common reeds\nthat through the marshes or by rivers grow,\nand have no music in them.\n\nduchess\nyet out of these\nthe singer, who is love, will make a pipe\nand from them he draws music; so i think\nlove will bring music out of any life.\nis that not true?\n\nguido\nsweet, women make it true.\nthere are men who paint pictures, and carve statues,\npaul of verona and the dyer's son,\nor their great rival, who, by the sea at venice,\nhas set god's little maid upon the stair,\nwhite as her own white lily, and as tall,\nor raphael, whose madonnas are divine\nbecause they are mothers merely; yet i think\nwomen are the best artists of the world,\nfor they can take the common lives of men\nsoiled with the money-getting of our age,\nand with love make them beautiful.\n\nduchess\nah, dear,\ni wish that you and i were very poor;\nthe poor, who love each other, are so rich.\n\nguido\ntell me again you love me, beatrice.\n\nduchess\n\nhow well this collar lies about your throat.\n\n\nguido\nnay, tell me that you love me.\n\nduchess\ni remember,\nthat when i was a child in my dear france,\nbeing at court at fontainebleau, the king\nwore such a collar.\n\nguido\nwill you not say you love me?\n\nduchess\n\nhe was a very royal man, king francis,\nyet he was not royal as you are.\nwhy need i tell you, guido, that i love you?\n\ndo you not know that i am yours for ever,\nbody and soul?\n\noh, what is that? \n\nguido\nwhat, love?\n\nduchess\nmethought i saw a face with eyes of flame\nlook at us through the doorway.\n\nguido\nnay, '\nthe passing shadow of the man on guard.\n\n'twas nothing, sweet.\n\nduchess\nay! what can harm us now,\nwho are in love's hand? i do not think i'd care\nthough the vile world should with its lackey slander\ntrample and tread upon my life; why should i?\nthey say the common field-flowers of the field\nhave sweeter scent when they are trodden on\nthan when they bloom alone, and that some herbs\nwhich have no perfume, on being bruis\u00e9d die\nwith all arabia round them; so it is\nwith the young lives this dull world seeks to crush,\nit does but bring the sweetness out of them,\nand makes them lovelier often. and besides,\n\nis it not so?\n\nguido\ndear, shall we play or sing?\ni think that i could sing now.\n\nduchess\ndo not speak,\nfor there are times when all existences\nseem narrowed to one single ecstasy,\nand passion sets a seal upon the lips.\n\nguido\noh, with mine own lips let me break that seal!\nyou love me, beatrice?\n\nduchess\nay! is it not strange\ni should so love mine enemy?\n\nguido\nwho is he?\n\nduchess\nwhy, that with your shaft did pierce my heart!\npoor heart, that lived its little lonely life\nuntil it met your arrow.\n\nguido\nah, dear love,\ni am so wounded by that bolt myself\nthat with untended wounds i lie a-dying,\nunless you cure me, dear physician.\n\nduchess\ni would not have you cured; for i am sick\nwith the same malady.\n\nguido\noh, how i love you!\nsee, i must steal the cuckoo's voice, and tell\nthe one tale over.\n\nduchess\ntell no other tale!\nfor, if that is the little cuckoo's song,\nthe nightingale is hoarse, and the loud lark\nhas lost its music.\n\nguido\nkiss me, beatrice!\n\n\nservant\na package for you, sir.\n\nguido\n ah! give it to me.  \n\nduchess\n\nnow i will wager it is from some girl\nwho would have you wear her favour; i am so jealous\ni will not give up the least part in you,\nbut like a miser keep you to myself,\nand spoil you perhaps in keeping.\n\nguido\nit is nothing.\n\nduchess\nnay, it is from some girl.\n\nguido\nyou know 'tis not.\n\nduchess\n\nnow, traitor, tell me what does this sign mean,\na dagger with two leopards wrought in steel?\n\nguido\n o god!\n\nduchess\ni'll from the window look, and try\nif i can't see the porter's livery\nwho left it at the gate! i will not rest\ntill i have learned your secret.\n\n\nguido\noh, horrible!\nhad i so soon forgot my father's death,\ndid i so soon let love into my heart,\nand must i banish love, and let in murder\nthat beats and clamours at the outer gate?\nay, that i must! have i not sworn an oath?\nyet not to-night; nay, it must be to-night.\nfarewell then all the joy and light of life,\nall dear recorded memories, farewell,\nfarewell all love! could i with bloody hands\nfondle and paddle with her innocent hands?\ncould i with lips fresh from this butchery\nplay with her lips? could i with murderous eyes\nlook in those violet eyes, whose purity\nwould strike men blind, and make each eyeball reel\nin night perpetual? no, murder has set\na barrier between us far too high\nfor us to kiss across it.\n\nduchess\nguido!\n\nguido\nbeatrice,\nyou must forget that name, and banish me\nout of your life for ever.\n\nduchess\n\no dear love!\n\nguido\n\nthere lies a barrier between us two\nwe dare not pass.\n\nduchess\ni dare do anything\nso that you are beside me.\n\nguido\nah! there it is,\ni cannot be beside you, cannot breathe\nthe air you breathe; i cannot any more\nstand face to face with beauty, which unnerves\nmy shaking heart, and makes my desperate hand\nfail of its purpose. let me go hence, i pray;\nforget you ever looked upon me.\n\nduchess\nwhat!\nwith your hot kisses fresh upon my lips\nforget the vows of love you made to me?\n\nguido\ni take them back.\n\nduchess\nalas, you cannot, guido,\nfor they are part of nature now; the air\nis tremulous with their music, and outside\nthe little birds sing sweeter for those vows.\n\nguido\nthere lies a barrier between us now,\nwhich then i knew not, or i had forgot.\n\nduchess\nthere is no barrier, guido; why, i will go\nin poor attire, and will follow you\nover the world.\n\nguido\n\nthe world's not wide enough\nto hold us two! farewell, farewell for ever.\n\nduchess\n\nwhy did you come into my life at all, then,\nor in the desolate garden of my heart\nsow that white flower of love -?\n\nguido\no beatrice!\n\nduchess\nwhich now you would dig up, uproot, tear out,\nthough each small fibre doth so hold my heart\nthat if you break one, my heart breaks with it?\nwhy did you come into my life? why open\nthe secret wells of love i had sealed up?\nwhy did you open them -?\n\nguido\no god!\n\nduchess\n\nand let\nthe floodgates of my passion swell and burst\ntill, like the wave when rivers overflow\nthat sweeps the forest and the farm away,\nlove in the splendid avalanche of its might\nswept my life with it? must i drop by drop\ngather these waters back and seal them up?\nalas! each drop will be a tear, and so\nwill with its saltness make life very bitter.\n\nguido\ni pray you speak no more, for i must go\nforth from your life and love, and make a way\non which you cannot follow.\n\nduchess\ni have heard\nthat sailors dying of thirst upon a raft,\npoor castaways upon a lonely sea,\ndream of green fields and pleasant water-courses,\nand then wake up with red thirst in their throats,\nand die more miserably because sleep\n so they die cursing sleep\n i will not curse you\nthough i am cast away upon the sea\nwhich men call desolation.\n\nguido\no god, god!\n\nduchess\n listen, i love you, guido.\n\nis echo dead, that when i say i love you\nthere is no answer?\n\nguido\neverything is dead,\nsave one thing only, which shall die to-night!\n\nduchess\nif you are going, touch me not, but go.\n\nbarrier! barrier!\nwhy did he say there was a barrier?\nthere is no barrier between us two.\nhe lied to me, and shall i for that reason\nloathe what i love, and what i worshipped, hate?\ni think we women do not love like that.\nfor if i cut his image from my heart,\nmy heart would, like a bleeding pilgrim, follow\nthat image through the world, and call it back\nwith little cries of love.\n\n\nduke\nmadam, you keep us waiting;\nyou keep my dogs waiting.\n\nduchess\ni will not ride to-day.\n\nduke\nhow now, what's this?\n\nduchess\nmy lord, i cannot go.\n\nduke\nwhat, pale face, do you dare to stand against me?\nwhy, i could set you on a sorry jade\nand lead you through the town, till the low rabble\nyou feed toss up their hats and mock at you.\n\nduchess\nhave you no word of kindness ever for me?\n\nduke\ni hold you in the hollow of my hand\nand have no need on you to waste kind words.\n\nduchess\nwell, i will go.\n\nduke\n\nno, i have changed my mind,\nyou will stay here, and like a faithful wife\nwatch from the window for our coming back.\nwere it not dreadful if some accident\nby chance should happen to your loving lord?\ncome, gentlemen, my hounds begin to chafe,\nand i chafe too, having a patient wife.\nwhere is young guido?\n\nmaffio\nmy liege, i have not seen him\nfor a full hour past.\n\nduke\nit matters not,\ni dare say i shall see him soon enough.\nwell, madam, you will sit at home and spin.\ni do protest, sirs, the domestic virtues\nare often very beautiful in others.\n\n\n\nduchess\nthe stars have fought against me, that is all,\nand thus to-night when my lord lieth asleep,\nwill i fall upon my dagger, and so cease.\nmy heart is such a stone nothing can reach it\nexcept the dagger' let it go there,\n ay! to-night\ndeath will divorce the duke; and yet to-night\nhe may die also, he is very old.\nwhy should he not die? yesterday his hand\n men have died from palsy,\nand why not he? are there not fevers also,\nagues and chills, and other maladies\nmost incident to old age?\nno, no, he will not die, he is too sinful;\nhonest men die before their proper time.\n men by whose side the duke\nin all the sick pollution of his life\n women and children die,\nbut the duke will not die, he is too sinful.\noh, can it be\nthere is some immortality in sin,\nwhich virtue has not? and does the wicked man\ndraw life from what to other men were death,\nlike poisonous plants that on corruption live?\nno, no,\n he is too sinful.\nbut i will die alone, and on this night\ngrim death shall be my bridegroom, and the tomb\n well, what of that?\nthe world's a graveyard, and we each, like coffins,\nwithin us bear a skeleton.\n\n\n\nmoranzone\nwhere is guido?\ni cannot find him anywhere.\n\nduchess\n o god!\n'twas thou who took my love away from me.\n\nmoranzone\n\nwhat, has he left you?\n\nduchess\nnay, you know he has.\noh, give him back to me, give him back, i say,\nor i will tear your body limb from limb,\nand to the common gibbet nail your head\nuntil the carrion crows have stripped it bare.\nbetter you had crossed a hungry lioness\nbefore you came between me and my love.\n\nnay, give him back, you know not how i love him.\nhere by this chair he knelt a half hour since;\n'twas there he stood, and there he looked at me;\nthis is the hand he kissed, and these the ears\ninto whose open portals he did pour\na tale of love so musical that all\nthe birds stopped singing! oh, give him back to me.\n\nmoranzone\nhe does not love you, madam.\n\nduchess\nmay the plague\nwither the tongue that says so! give him back.\n\nmoranzone\nmadam, i tell you you will never see him,\nneither to-night, nor any other night.\n\nduchess\nwhat is your name?\n\nmoranzone\nmy name? revenge!\n\n\nduchess\nrevenge!\ni think i never harmed a little child.\nwhat should revenge do coming to my door?\nit matters not, for death is there already,\nwaiting with his dim torch to light my way.\n'tis true men hate thee, death, and yet i think\nthou wilt be kinder to me than my lover,\nand so dispatch the messengers at once,\nharry the lazy steeds of lingering day,\nand let the night, thy sister, come instead,\nand drape the world in mourning; let the owl,\nwho is thy minister, scream from his tower\nand wake the toad with hooting, and the bat,\nthat is the slave of dim persephone,\nwheel through the sombre air on wandering wing!\ntear up the shrieking mandrakes from the earth\nand bid them make us music, and tell the mole\nto dig deep down thy cold and narrow bed,\nfor i shall lie within thine arms to-night.\n\nend of act ii.","song":"Are You Lonely For Me","year":1991},{"artist":"BeBe & CeCe

i'll be- i'll be right back.\n\n\n\n okay. okay, we'll be here! hating you! did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? listen honey, if i'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because i'm telling you, this feels great.\n\n yeah... i'm pretty sure i'm still gonna marry him.\n\n what are you talking about?! mindy, the guy is the devil! he's satan in a smock!\n\n look, i know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, i still really wanna be mrs. dr. barry farber, dds.\n\n oh god.\n\n i hope you can find some way to be happy for me. and i hope you'll still be my maid of honour...?\n\n and i hope barry doesn't kill you and eat you in aruba.\n\n monica and rachel's \n\n you okay?\n\n yeah.\n\n really?\n\n yeah! y'know, ever since i ran out on barry at the wedding, i have wondered whether i made the right choice. and now i know.\n\n aww... \n\n\n\n big day.\n\nclosing credits\n\n\n central perk \n\n all right, i'll give you this, mr. peanut is a better dresser. i mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...\n\n you know he's gay?\n\n are you outing mr. peanut?\n\n\n\n chandler?\n\n danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody.\n\n hi. hi.\n\n what are you doing here?\n\n well, i've been calling you, but it turns out i had your number wrong. and when i finally got the right one from information, there was no answer. so i thought i'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.\n\n ...i'm, i'm okay.\n\n listen uh, maybe we could get together later?\n\n that sounds good. i'll call you- or you call me, whatever...\n\n you got it.\n\n okay.\n\n g'bye, everybody.\n\n bye.\n\n whoo-hoo!\n\n yeah, there you go!\n\n second date!\n\n ...i dunno.\n\n you don't know?\n\n well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if i was okay?

aside.\n\nthis shouldn't be the case \u2014 there's way more to her story than \"un-break my heart.\"\n\nknown for her sultry, low-ranging contralto voice, braxton -- who turns 50 this saturday, oct. 7 -- provided the r&b, pop, and adult contemporary hemispheres with a slew of signature classics.\n\nthe dramatic flare of these songs, matched with her film noir aesthetic and style, convincingly sold braxton's extensive discography centered on the raging emotions of love and heartbreak. the smoothness and mature sophistication in her sound offered a lighter  shading to the early waves of hip-hop soul and alternative-r&b that reigned supreme in the '90s.\n\nwell into the early aughts, braxton would find herself pairing quiet storm vibes with hip-hop undertones.\n\nafter an unfortunate dip in mainstream appeal maligned by label issues and personal matters in the mid-00's , braxton regained her place in the spotlight with a dancing with the stars stint, a successful reality tv show alongside her sisters, and a critically-acclaimed reunion album with her mentor kenneth \"babyface\" edmonds.\n\nnow the legend prepares to release her ninth studio album, slated to be released next year, including her current single \"deadwood.\"\n\nto celebrate the songstress' milestone birthday, billboard ranks the 25 best toni braxton songs, including singles and deep cuts.\n\n#25. \"you mean the world to me\" \n\nafter departing from her all-sisters quintet, the braxtons, the eldest of the girl group embarked on a successful solo career.\n\n1993 saw the arrival of toni braxton, a self-titled debut that topped both the billboard 200 and r&b albums charts for multiple weeks. as the fourth lead single on the lp, \"you mean the world\" reached the top 10 of the billboard hot 100 in 1994, thanks to the soulful swing of the \n\n#24. \"why should i care\" \n\nfollowing up her debut with secrets, braxton reinvigorated the sound and format of quiet storm with arguably her best album to date.\n\nfull of ballads centered on dealing with an unfaithful soulmate, secrets cemented the legacy of braxton's signature blend of mature-r&b with breezy adult contemporary. in this deep cut, the crooner questions why she should care about said partner over a psychedelic guitar riff and synth reminiscent of the isley brothers.\n\n#23. \"spanish guitar\" \n\nmost legends can't say that their international single became a soundtrack staple for a brazilian soap opera. la\u00e7os de fam\u00edlia would help braxton's latin pop ballad become a mass success in its home country -- and ultimately a primary example of latin music's influence on mainstream culture.\n\n#22. \"the heat\" \n\n\"spanish guitar\" aptly oozed a sweltering mystique fitting enough for braxton's third studio album, the heat. also incorporating that magic is the album's title track, a subtle jaunt working in the sounds of a tropical summer and a light, jazzy groove. no wonder why the ending question is \"does anyone want some ice cream?\"\n\n#21. \"hit the freeway\" feat. loon \n\nentering the new millennium, braxton gained more artistic control from laface. she also felt a need to strip away some of her balladry and embrace her love of hip-hop \u00e1 la mariah carey's butterfly. braxton's first lps of the aughts -- the heat and more than a woman -- also embraced a sexier, borderline controversial side of the songstress.\n\nas the lone single from more than a woman, \"freeway\" joins a list of notable bangers produced by pharrell's launching pad, the neptunes. and thanks to its loon co-sign, it also has a bad boys records stamp of approval.\n\n#20. \"trippin' \" \n\nafter leaving laface records in 2003, braxton signed to the record label abyss known as blackground records. if you're familiar with the label's nightmare stories revolving around aaliyah and jojo, it goes without saying that braxton's first  album under the label, libra, didn't fare well commercially.\n\nthat being said, the lp contains the singer's peak unreleased singles and barely-existent promos. a comparison of spousal conflict with \"12 rounds up inside the  garden.\"\n\n#19. \"talking in his sleep\" \n\n\"can you keep a secret?\" asks the diva throughout the epicenter track of secrets. here, she's confronted by her adulterous lover who accidentally spills his dirty laundry while snoozing.\n\nafflicted by a 70s noir-jazz riff, \"talking\" takes a page from madonna's \"justify my love,\" balancing a scandalous spoken word narrative with a seductive hook.\n\n#18. \"yesterday\" feat. trey songz \n\nit'd take five years after libra -- and a release from blackground records -- for braxton to deliver her next studio album. serving as the first single from pulse, the singer gets over her ex  by labeling him a day of the past. \"yesterday\" served as a testament to how braxton manages to maintain her signature blend of genre formats years after her higher charting moments.\n\n#17. \"hurt you\" feat. babyface \n\nwhen braxton started her singing career in 1989, babyface became an integral component of her artistry. after going through separate divorces, the duo partnered up for the grammy-winning concept album love, marriage, and divorce, featuring this apology ballad that topped the adult r&b songs chart.\n\n#16. \"midnite\" \n\nthis cut from libra perfectly captures braxton's ability to cruise along with the stripped melodic structuring of her songs. her ad-libs and riffs shine throughout \"midnite,\" making it a pleasant earworm in her deeper catalogue.\n\n#15. \"love shoulda brought you home\" \n\nalthough \"give u my heart\" -- a duet with babyface -- is credited as braxton's official single debut, \"love\" receives the honor of her first solo effort. both songs appeared on the eddie murphy rom-com boomerang, but \"love\" would be regarded as the favorite thanks to braxton's powerhouse vocal control and dexterity.\n\n#14. \"how many ways\" \n\nreleased as a single in 1994, \"how many ways\" adequately reflects the finalization of new jack swing and the emerging popularity of its brethren, hip-hop soul.\n\nthe soulful declaration -- co-written and produced by tamar's future husband vincent hubert -- sees braxton recounting various ways she loves her man. the single served opposite to its double-a side, the whitney houston-esque \"i belong to you.\"\n\n#13. \"seven whole days\" \n\nregarded as one of braxton's iconic singles, the songstress recalls not knowing her lover's whereabouts for more than a week.\n\nwritten and produced by her dream team of babyface and darryl simmons, braxton's runs are what impressed listeners the most. she would later revisit the song's idea, slyly mentioning \"going seven whole days without hearing from you,\" on \"finally,\" libra's semi-mash-up of her most famous lyrics.\n\n#12. \"just be a man about it\" \n\nsince the heat was meant to embrace the more progressive sounds of contemporary r&b, braxton also incorporated a little electro-hop on the album's second single.\n\nwith the support of a stormy atmosphere and womanizing voicemail delivered by dr. dre, the singer's hurt vocals shine in yet another convincing performance.\n\n#11. \"there's no me without you\" \n\nthis deep cut earnestly emotes despair and a feeling of defeat after a break-up.\n\nhelped by backing vocals of the songwriter, babyface, this toni braxton song's --  the singer adopting the vocal patterns of the genre with a pristine r&b palette.\n\n#10. \"take this ring\" \n\nimma let you finish beyonc\u00e9, but toni braxton had one of the best \"single ladies\" of all time.\n\nthree years before we'd receive an official dance and a spandex-driven anthem from bey, braxton released a club banger echoing a similar sentiment. fortified by a rocking go-go beat -- produced by \"crazy in love\" and \"1 thing\" hitmaker rich harrison -- this dose of playboy-repellent serves as a faint reminder of a music moment somewhat ahead of its time.\n\n#9. \"sposed to be\" \n\non libra, \"take this ring\" was the upbeat single deserving more; \"sposed to be\" was the slow jam that could have been more.\n\na great candidate for quiet storm or lovemaking playlists, this deep cut radiates an intergalactic tranquility -- and infectious bridge -- highlighting the finesse of braxton's later discography.\n\n#8. \"hands tied\" \n\nthe second single of pulse came as another one of braxton's sultrier career moments.\n\nwith an urgent vocal performance, the allure of \"hands tied\" exists in its zephyrous keyboard chords. the song also provided a glimpse into the softer side of warren \"oak\" felder, who'd go on to produce for rihanna and demi lovato.\n\n#7. \"another sad love song\" \n\nfrom its opening \"oh's\" and \"woah's\" over a slinky melody, the first official single from toni braxton played on r&b's knack for providing radio with sad tunes.\n\nwith an addictive \"racking  brains like crazy,\" the song reached no. 7 on the hot 100 and earned a grammy for \"best r&b vocal performance, female.\"\n\n#6. \"i love me some him\" \n\nif r&b radio is unanimously consistent with playing one toni braxton single since its release, \"i love me some him\" would hold that title for sure.\n\nregarded as one of her signatures, the song was released as a double-a side single to the r. kelly-penned \"i don't want to.\" the best part exists at the end of this cosmopolitan ode -- braxton's vocal harmonizing with the instrumental stealing the show.\n\n#5. \"find me a man\" \n\ntoday, secrets remains without a skippable track. it also contains the singer's best deep cut.\n\nin terms of essential toni braxton, \"find me a man\" shows the singer's ability to draw listeners into her raw emotion over a cerebral melody. here heartbreak reigns as the songstress finds herself tired of being alone, dreaming up the irresistible qualities of her prince charming.\n\n#4. \"un-break my heart\" \n\nstanding as one of the greatest power ballads to ever exist, this hot 100 chart-topper is the central song of braxton's career. vibrant in grandiose-theatrics and a heart-wrenching , \"un-break my heart\" would sit at the summit for 11 weeks.\n\n#3. \"breathe again\" \n\nas these toni braxton songs age, this single from her debut still finds its way on r&b rotation today. sparkling in sade-centric balladry and diane warren lyrics, the breathy 's intended moodiness.\n\n\"breathe again\" would become a no. 3 hit and earn the singer's second grammy win for best r&b vocal performance, female.\n\n#2. \"he wasn't man enough for me\" \n\nthe new millennium might have seen a new look and sound from the diva, but her anthemic spirit remained fervent. in the league of \"no scrubs\" and \"independent women, pt. 1,\" this song holds its own rightful spot.\n\nproduced by rodney \"darkchild\" jerkins, this signature dance bop was blocked from the hot 100's top spot by the stronghold of carlos santana and the product g&b's \"maria maria.\" today, it's revisited by those realizing a past flame couldn't handle it all.\n\n#1. \"let it flow\" \n\npaired alongside \"you're makin' me high,\" this double a-side single peaked at no. 1 on the hot 100. unlike its partnered uptempo jaunt, \"let it flow\" drifts like a slow-running stream guided by the presence of a hypnotizing guitar.\n\nstaying in line with the anthems braxton has provided prior to and after \"let it flow,\" the song became a mainstay on radio, the waiting to exhale soundtrack, and most importantly braxton's performance catalogue.\n\nsimply put, \"let it flow\" could have been done by none other than the superstar herself -- particularly the mesmerizing ending.","song":"You're Makin' Me High\/Let It Flow","year":1996},{"artist":"R.

president,\n\nhe who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than i have. i do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more\nshrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than i do this day. a feeling has crept over me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. the task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. i know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. i trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. should i seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me. the little experience i have had in addressing public meetings, in country schoolhouses, avails me nothing on the present occasion.\n\nthe papers and placards say, that i am to deliver a 4th  july oration. this certainly sounds large, and out of the common way, for it is true that i have often had the privilege to speak in this beautiful hall, and to address many who now honor me with their presence. but neither their familiar faces, nor the perfect gage i think i have of corinthian hall, seems to free me from embarrassment.\n\nthe fact is, ladies and gentlemen, the distance between this platform and the slave plantation, from which i escaped, is considerable\u2014and the difficulties to be overcome in getting from the latter to the former, are by no means slight. that i am here to-day is, to me, a matter of astonishment as well as of gratitude. you will not, therefore, be surprised, if in what i have to say i evince no elaborate preparation, nor grace my speech with any high sounding exordium. with little experience and with less learning, i have been able to throw my thoughts hastily and imperfectly together; and trusting to your patient and generous indulgence, i will proceed to lay them before you.\n\nthis, for the purpose of this celebration, is the 4th of july. it is the birthday of your national independence, and of your political freedom. this, to you, is what the passover was to the emancipated people of god. it carries your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance; and to the signs, and to the wonders, associated with that act, and that day. this celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the republic of america is now 76 years old. i am glad, fellow-citizens, that your nation is so young. seventy-six years, though a good old age for a man, is but a mere speck in the life of a nation. three score years and ten is the allotted time for individual men; but nations number their years by thousands. according to this fact, you are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. i repeat, i am glad this is so. there is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon. the eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times; but his heart may well beat lighter at the thought that america is young, and that she is still in the impressible stage of her existence. may he not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? were the nation older, the patriot's heart might be sadder, and the reformer's brow heavier. its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. there is consolation in the thought that america is young. great streams are not easily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages. they may sometimes rise in quiet and stately majesty, and inundate the land, refreshing and fertilizing the earth with their mysterious properties. they may also rise in wrath and fury, and bear away, on their angry waves, the accumulated wealth of years of toil and hardship. they, however, gradually flow back to the same old channel, and flow on as serenely as ever. but, while the river may not be turned aside, it may dry up, and leave nothing behind but the withered branch, and the unsightly rock, to howl in the abyss-sweeping wind, the sad tale of departed glory. as with rivers so with nations.\n\nfellow-citizens, i shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. the simple story of it is that, 76 years ago, the people of this country were british subjects. the style and title of your \"sovereign people\"  was not then born. you were under the british crown. your fathers esteemed the english government as the home government; and england as the fatherland. this home government, you know, although a considerable distance from your home, did, in the exercise of its parental prerogatives, impose upon its colonial children, such restraints, burdens and limitations, as, in its mature judgment, it deemed wise, right and proper.\n\nbut, your fathers, who had not adopted the fashionable idea of this day, of the infallibility of government, and the absolute character of its acts, presumed to differ from the home government in respect to the wisdom and the justice of some of those burdens and restraints. they went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the measures of government unjust, unreasonable, and oppressive, and altogether such as ought not to be quietly submitted to. i scarcely need say, fellow-citizens, that my opinion of those measures fully accords with that of your fathers. such a declaration of agreement on my part would not be worth much to anybody. it would, certainly, prove nothing, as to what part i might have taken, had i lived during the great controversy of 1776. to say now that america was right, and england wrong, is exceedingly easy. everybody can say it; the dastard, not less than the noble brave, can flippantly discant on the tyranny of england towards the american colonies. it is fashionable to do so; but there was a time when to pronounce against england, and in favor of the cause of the colonies, tried men's souls. they who did so were accounted in their day, plotters of mischief, agitators and rebels, dangerous men. to side with the right, against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day. the cause of liberty may be stabbed by the men who glory in the deeds of your fathers. but, to proceed.\n\nfeeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. they petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. this, however, did not answer the purpose. they saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. yet they persevered. they were not the men to look back.\n\nas the sheet anchor takes a firmer hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger, as it breasted the chilling blasts of kingly displeasure. the greatest and best of british statesmen admitted its justice, and the loftiest eloquence of the british senate came to its support. but, with that blindness which seems to be the unvarying characteristic of tyrants, since pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the red sea, the british government persisted in the exactions complained of.\n\nthe madness of this course, we believe, is admitted now, even by england; but we fear the lesson is wholly lost on our present ruler.\n\noppression makes a wise man mad. your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. they felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. with brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! it was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. the timid and the prudent  of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.\n\nsuch people lived then, had lived before, and will, probably, ever have a place on this planet; and their course, in respect to any great change, , may be calculated with as much precision as can be the course of the stars. they hate all changes, but silver, gold and copper change! of this sort of change they are always strongly in favor.\n\nthese people were called tories in the days of your fathers; and the appellation, probably, conveyed the same idea that is meant by a more modern, though a somewhat less euphonious term, which we often find in our papers, applied to some of our old politicians.\n\ntheir opposition to the then dangerous thought was earnest and powerful; but, amid all their terror and affrighted vociferations against it, the alarming and revolutionary idea moved on, and the country with it.\n\non the 2d of july, 1776, the old continental congress, to the dismay of the lovers of ease, and the worshipers of property, clothed that dreadful idea with all the authority of national sanction. they did so in the form of a resolution; and as we seldom hit upon resolutions, drawn up in our day whose transparency is at all equal to this, it may refresh your minds and help my story if i read it. \"resolved, that these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown; and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is, and ought to be, dissolved.\"\n\ncitizens, your fathers made good that resolution. they succeeded; and to-day you reap the fruits of their success. the freedom gained is yours; and you, therefore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. the 4th of july is the first great fact in your nation's history\u2014the very ring-bolt in the chain of your yet undeveloped destiny.\n\npride and patriotism, not less than gratitude, prompt you to celebrate and to hold it in perpetual remembrance. i have said that the declaration of independence is the ring-bolt to the chain of your nation's destiny; so, indeed, i regard it. the principles contained in that instrument are saving principles. stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.\n\nfrom the round top of your ship of state, dark and threatening clouds may be seen. heavy billows, like mountains in the distance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! that bolt drawn, that chain broken, and all is lost. cling to this day\u2014cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.\n\nthe coming into being of a nation, in any circumstances, is an interesting event. but, besides general considerations, there were peculiar circumstances which make the advent of this republic an event of special attractiveness.\n\nthe whole scene, as i look back to it, was simple, dignified and sublime.\n\nthe population of the country, at the time, stood at the insignificant number of three millions. the country was poor in the munitions of war. the population was weak and scattered, and the country a wilderness unsubdued. there were then no means of concert and combination, such as exist now. neither steam nor lightning had then been reduced to order and discipline. from the potomac to the delaware was a journey of many days. under these, and innumerable other disadvantages, your fathers declared for liberty and independence and triumphed.\n\nfellow citizens, i am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. the signers of the declaration of independence were brave men. they were great men too\u2014great enough to give fame to a great age. it does not often happen to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. the point from which i am compelled to view them is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet i cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. they were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, i will unite with you to honor their memory.\n\nthey loved their country better than their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare virtue, and that when it is exhibited, it ought to command respect. he who will, intelligently, lay down his life for his country, is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise. your fathers staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, on the cause of their country. in their admiration of liberty, they lost sight of all other interests.\n\nthey were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. they were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression. they showed forbearance; but that they knew its limits. they believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny. with them, nothing was \"settled\" that was not right. with them, justice, liberty and humanity were \"final;\" not slavery and oppression. you may well cherish the memory of such men. they were great in their day and generation. their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.\n\nhow circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! how unlike the politicians of an hour! their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. they seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defense. mark them!\n\nfully appreciating the hardship to be encountered, firmly believing in the right of their cause, honorably inviting the scrutiny of an on-looking world, reverently appealing to heaven to attest their sincerity, soundly comprehending the solemn responsibility they were about to assume, wisely measuring the terrible odds against them, your fathers, the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep the corner-stone of the national superstructure, which has risen and still rises in grandeur around you.\n\nof this fundamental work, this day is the anniversary. our eyes are met with demonstrations of joyous enthusiasm. banners and pennants wave exultingly on the breeze. the din of business, too, is hushed. even mammon seems to have quitted his grasp on this day. the ear-piercing fife and the stirring drum unite their accents with the ascending peal of a thousand church bells. prayers are made, hymns are sung, and sermons are preached in honor of this day; while the quick martial tramp of a great and multitudinous nation, echoed back by all the hills, valleys and mountains of a vast continent, bespeak the occasion one of thrilling and universal interest\u2014a nation's jubilee.\n\nfriends and citizens, i need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. many of you understand them better than i do. you could instruct me in regard to them. that is a branch of knowledge in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker. the causes which led to the separation of the colonies from the british crown have never lacked for a tongue. they have all been taught in your common schools, narrated at your firesides, unfolded from your pulpits, and thundered from your legislative halls, and are as familiar to you as household words. they form the staple of your national poetry and eloquence.\n\ni remember, also, that, as a people, americans are remarkably familiar with all facts which make in their own favor. this is esteemed by some as a national trait\u2014perhaps a national weakness. it is a fact, that whatever makes for the wealth or for the reputation of americans, and can be had cheap! will be found by americans. i shall not be charged with slandering americans, if i say i think the american side of any question may be safely left in american hands.\n\ni leave, therefore, the great deeds of your fathers to other gentlemen whose claim to have been regularly descended will be less likely to be disputed than mine!\n\nmy business, if i have any here to-day, is with the present. the accepted time with god and his cause is the ever-living now.\ntrust no future, however pleasant,\nlet the dead past bury its dead;\nact, act in the living present,\nheart within, and god overhead.we have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. to all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. but now is the time, the important time. your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. you live and must die, and you must do your work. you have no right to enjoy a child's share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors. you have no right to wear out and waste the hard-earned fame of your fathers to cover your indolence. sydney smith tells us that men seldom eulogize the wisdom and virtues of their fathers, but to excuse some folly or wickedness of their own. this truth is not a doubtful one. there are illustrations of it near and remote, ancient and modern. it was fashionable, hundreds of years ago, for the children of jacob to boast, we have \"abraham to our father,\" when they had long lost abraham's faith and spirit. that people contented themselves under the shadow of abraham's great name, while they repudiated the deeds which made his name great. need i remind you that a similar thing is being done all over this country to-day? need i tell you that the jews are not the only people who built the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepulchres of the righteous? washington could not die till he had broken the chains of his slaves. yet his monument is built up by the price of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men shout\u2014\"we have washington to our father.\"\u2014alas! that it should be so; yet so it is.\nthe evil that men do, lives after them, the good is oft-interred with their bones.fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am i called upon to speak here to-day? what have i, or those i represent, to do with your national independence? are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that declaration of independence, extended to us? and am i, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?\n\nwould to god, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. for who is there so cold, that a nation's sympathy could not warm him? who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation's jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? i am not that man. in a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the \"lame man leap as an hart.\"\n\nbut, such is not the state of the case. i say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. i am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. the blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. \u2014the rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. the sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. this fourth  july is yours, not mine. you may rejoice, i must mourn. to drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? if so, there is a parallel to your conduct. and let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, lowering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! i can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!\n\n\"by the rivers of babylon, there we sat down. yea! we wept when we remembered zion. we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. for there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, sing us one of the songs of zion. how can we sing the lord's song in a strange land? if i forget thee, o jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. if i do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.\"\n\nfellow-citizens; above your national, tumultuous joy, i hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. if i do forget, if i do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, \"may my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\" to forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before god and the world. my subject, then fellow-citizens, is american slavery. i shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave's point of view. standing, there, identified with the american bondman, making his wrongs mine, i do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of july! whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. america is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. standing with god and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, i will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis i can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery\u2014the great sin and shame of america! \"i will not equivocate; i will not excuse;\" i will use the severest language i can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.\n\nbut i fancy i hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. but, i submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. what point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? on what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? must i undertake to prove that the slave is a man? that point is conceded already. nobody doubts it. the slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. they acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. there are seventy-two crimes in the state of virginia, which, if committed by a black man, , subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. what is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual and responsible being? the manhood of the slave is conceded. it is admitted in the fact that southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. when you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field, then i may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. when the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, then will i argue with you that the slave is a man!\n\nfor the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the negro race. is it not astonishing that, while we are ploughing, planting and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in california, capturing the whale in the pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the christian's god, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!\n\nwould you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightful owner of his own body? you have already declared it. must i argue the wrongfulness of slavery? is that a question for republicans? is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood? how should i look to-day, in the presence of americans, dividing, and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? speaking of it relatively, and positively, negatively, and affirmatively. to do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your understanding.\u2014there is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.\n\nwhat, am i to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to bum their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? must i argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? no! i will not. i have better employments for my time and strength than such arguments would imply.\n\nwhat, then, remains to be argued? is it that slavery is not divine; that god did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? there is blasphemy in the thought. that which is inhuman, cannot be divine! who can reason on such a proposition? they that can, may; i cannot. the time for such argument is passed.\n\nat a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. o! had i the ability, and could i reach the nation's ear, i would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. for it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. we need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. the feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against god and man must be proclaimed and denounced.\n\nwhat, to the american slave, is your 4th of july? a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. to him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy\u2014a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. there is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these united states, at this very hour.\n\ngo where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through south america, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, america reigns without a rival.\n\ntake the american slave-trade, which, we are told by the papers, is especially prosperous just now. ex-senator benton tells us that the price of men was never higher than now. he mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. this trade is one of the peculiarities of american institutions. it is carried on in all the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every year, by dealers in this horrid traffic. in several states, this trade is a chief source of wealth. it is called  \"the internal slave trade.\" it is, probably, called so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave-trade is contemplated. that trade has long since been denounced by this government, as piracy. it has been denounced with burning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable traffic. to arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of africa. everywhere, in this country, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave-trade, as a most inhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of god and of man. the duty to extirpate and destroy it, is admitted even by our doctors of divinity. in order to put an end to it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren  should leave this country, and establish themselves on the western coast of africa! it is, however, a notable fact that, while so much execration is poured out by americans upon those engaged in the foreign slave-trade, the men engaged in the slave-trade between the states pass without condemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.\n\nbehold the practical operation of this internal slave-trade, the american slave-trade, sustained by american politics and america religion. here you will see men and women reared like swine for the market. you know what is a swine-drover? i will show you a man-drover. they inhabit all our southern states. they perambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation, with droves of human stock. you will see one of these human flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children, from the potomac to the slave market at new orleans. these wretched people are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. they are food for the cotton-field, and the deadly sugar-mill. mark the sad procession, as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them. hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives! there, see the old man, with locks thinned and gray. cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. see, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping, yes! weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn! the drove moves tardily. heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their strength; suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted with a scream, that seems to have torn its way to the center of your soul! the crack you heard, was the sound of the slave-whip; the scream you heard, was from the woman you saw with the babe. her speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains! that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. follow the drove to new orleans. attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of american slave-buyers. see this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. tell me citizens, where, under the sun, you can witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking. yet this is but a glance at the american slave-trade, as it exists, at this moment, in the ruling part of the united states.\n\ni was born amid such sights and scenes. to me the american slave-trade is a terrible reality. when a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of its horrors. i lived on philpot street, fell's point, baltimore, and have watched from the wharves, the slave ships in the basin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down the chesapeake. there was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of pratt street, by austin woldfolk. his agents were sent into every town and county in maryland, announcing their arrival, through the papers, and on flaming \"hand-bills,\" headed cash for negroes. these men were generally well dressed men, and very captivating in their manners. ever ready to drink, to treat, and to gamble. the fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mother by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.\n\nthe flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, to the general depot at baltimore. when a sufficient number have been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew to mobile, or to new orleans. from the slave prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of night; for since the antislavery agitation, a certain caution is observed.\n\nin the deep still darkness of midnight, i have been often aroused by the dead heavy footsteps, and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door. the anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and i was often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. i was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.\n\nfellow-citizens, this murderous traffic is, to-day, in active operation in this boasted republic. in the solitude of my spirit, i see clouds of dust raised on the highways of the south; i see the bleeding footsteps; i hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave-markets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. there i see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice and rapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. my soul sickens at the sight.\nis this the land your fathers loved,\nthe freedom which they toiled to win?\nis this the earth whereon they moved?\nare these the graves they slumber in?but a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains to be presented. by an act of the american congress, not yet two years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. by that act, mason and dixon's line has been obliterated; new york has become as virginia; and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole united states. the power is co-extensive with the star-spangled banner and american christianity. where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter. where these are, man is not sacred. he is a bird for the sportsman's gun. by that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person of every man are put in peril. your broad republican domain is hunting ground for men. not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime. your lawmakers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this hellish sport. your president, your secretary of state, your lords, nobles, and ecclesiastics, enforce, as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country, and to your god, that you do this accursed thing. not fewer than forty americans have, within the past two years, been hunted down and, without a moment's warning, hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. some of these have had wives and children, dependent on them for bread; but of this, no account was made. the right of the hunter to his prey stands superior to the right of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of god included! for black men there are neither law, justice, humanity, not religion. the fugitive slave law makes mercy to them a crime; and bribes the judge who tries them. an american judge gets ten dollars for every victim he con signs to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so. the oath of any two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! his own testimony is nothing. he can bring no witnesses for himself. the minister of american justice is bound by the law to hear but one side; and that side, is the side of the oppressor. let this damning fact be perpetually told. let it be thundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king-hating, people-loving, democratic, christian america, the seats of justice are filled with judges, who hold their offices under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man's liberty, hear only his accusers!\n\nin glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of administering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless, and in diabolical intent, this fugitive slave law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation. i doubt if there be another nation on the globe, having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. if any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, i will gladly confront him at any suitable time and place he may select.\n\ni take this law to be one of the grossest infringements of christian liberty, and, if the churches and ministers of our country were not stupidly blind, or most wickedly indifferent, they, too, would so regard it.\n\nat the very moment that they are thanking god for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, and for the right to worship god according to the dictates of their own consciences, they are utterly silent in respect to a law which robs religion of its chief significance, and makes it utterly worthless to a world lying in wickedness. did this law concern the \"mint, anise, and cumin\"\u2014abridge the fight to sing psalms, to partake of the sacrament, or to engage in any of the ceremonies of religion, it would be smitten by the thunder of a thousand pulpits. a general shout would go up from the church, demanding repeal, repeal, instant repeal!\u2014and it would go hard with that politician who presumed to solicit the votes of the people without inscribing this motto on his banner. further, if this demand were not complied with, another scotland would be added to the history of religious liberty, and the stern old covenanters would be thrown into the shade. a john knox would be seen at every church door, and heard from every pulpit, and fillmore would have no more quarter than was shown by knox, to the beautiful, but treacherous queen mary of scotland. the fact that the church of our country, , does not esteem \"the fugitive slave law\" as a declaration of war against religious liberty, implies that that church regards religion simply as a form of worship, an empty ceremony, and not a vital principle, requiring active benevolence, justice, love and good will towards man. it esteems sacrifice above mercy; psalm-singing above right doing; solemn meetings above practical righteousness. a worship that can be conducted by persons who refuse to give shelter to the houseless, to give bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and who enjoin obedience to a law forbidding these acts of mercy, is a curse, not a blessing to mankind. the bible addresses all such persons as \"scribes, pharisees, hypocrites, who pay tithe of mint, anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith.\"\n\nbut the church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. it has made itself the bulwark of american slavery, and the shield of american slave-hunters. many of its most eloquent divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the bible to the whole slave system. they have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of god; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the lord jesus christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for christianity.\n\nfor my part, i would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those divines! they convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of thomas paine, voltaire, and bolingbroke, put together, have done! these ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion. they strip the love of god of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. it is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. it is not that \"pure and undefiled religion\" which is from above, and which is \"first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\" but a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes god a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man. all this we affirm to be true of the popular church, and the popular worship of our land and nation \u2013 a religion, a church, and a worship which, on the authority of inspired wisdom, we pronounce to be an abomination in the sight of god. in the language of isaiah, the american church might be well addressed, \"bring no more vain ablations; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, i cannot away with; it is iniquity even the solemn meeting. your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. they are a trouble to me; i am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you. yea! when ye make many prayers, i will not hear. your hands are full of blood; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge for the fatherless; plead for the widow.\"\n\nthe american church is guilty, when viewed in connection with what it is doing to uphold slavery; but it is superlatively guilty when viewed in connection with its ability to abolish slavery. the sin of which it is guilty is one of omission as well as of commission. albert barnes but uttered what the common sense of every man at all observant of the actual state of the case will receive as truth, when he declared that \"there is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.\"\n\nlet the religious press, the pulpit, the sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds; and that they do not do this involves them in the most awful responsibility of which the mind can conceive.\n\nin prosecuting the anti-slavery enterprise, we have been asked to spare the church, to spare the ministry; but how, we ask, could such a thing be done? we are met on the threshold of our efforts for the redemption of the slave, by the church and ministry of the country, in battle arrayed against us; and we are compelled to fight or flee. from what quarter, i beg to know, has proceeded a fire so deadly upon our ranks, during the last two years, as from the northern pulpit? as the champions of oppressors, the chosen men of american theology have appeared\u2014men, honored for their so-called piety, and their real learning. the lords of buffalo, the springs of new york, the lathrops of auburn, the coxes and spencers of brooklyn, the gannets and sharps of boston, the deweys of washington, and other great religious lights of the land have, in utter denial of the authority of him by whom the professed to he called to the ministry, deliberately taught us, against the example or the hebrews and against the remonstrance of the apostles, they teach that we ought to obey man's law before the law of god.\n\nmy spirit wearies of such blasphemy; and how such men can be supported, as the \"standing types and representatives of jesus christ,\" is a mystery which i leave others to penetrate. in speaking of the american church, however, let it be distinctly understood that i mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. there are exceptions, and i thank god that there are. noble men may be found, scattered all over these northern states, of whom henry ward beecher of brooklyn, samuel j. may of syracuse, and my esteemed friend  on the platform, are shining examples; and let me say further, that upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains.\n\none is struck with the difference between the attitude of the american church towards the anti-slavery movement, and that occupied by the churches in england towards a similar movement in that country. there, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, elevating, and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly, bound up the wounds of the west indian slave, and restored him to his liberty. there, the question of emancipation was a high religious question. it was demanded, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living god. the sharps, the clarksons, the wilberforces, the buxtons, and burchells and the knibbs, were alike famous for their piety, and for their philanthropy. the anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement, and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement, when the church of this country shall assume a favorable, instead or a hostile position towards that movement. americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. you boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure christianity, while the whole political power of the nation , is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. you hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of russia and austria, and pride yourselves on your democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of virginia and carolina. you invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. you glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation\u2014a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. you shed tears over fallen hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the american slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! you are all on fire at the mention of liberty for france or for ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of america. you discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. you can bare your bosom to the storm of british artillery to throw off a threepenny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. you profess to believe \"that, of one blood, god made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,\" and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, , all men whose skins are not colored like your own. you declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you \"hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;\" and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own thomas jefferson, \"is worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,\" a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.\n\nfellow-citizens! i will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. the existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your christianity as a lie. it destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. it saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a by word to a mocking earth. it is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your union. it fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it, as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. oh! be warned! be warned! a horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation's bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of god, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!\n\nbut it is answered in reply to all this, that precisely what i have now denounced is, in fact, guaranteed and sanctioned by the constitution of the united states; that the right to hold and to hunt slaves is a part of that constitution framed by the illustrious fathers of this republic.\n\nthen, i dare to affirm, notwithstanding all i have said before, your fathers stooped, basely stooped\n\nand keep the word of promise to the ear,\nbut break it to the heart.and instead of being the honest men i have before declared them to be, they were the veriest imposters that ever practiced on mankind. this is the inevitable conclusion, and from it there is no escape. but i differ from those who charge this baseness on the framers of the constitution of the united states. it is a slander upon their memory, at least, so i believe. there is not time now to argue the constitutional question at length \u2013 nor have i the ability to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. the subject has been handled with masterly power by lysander spooner, esq., by william goodell, by samuel e. sewall, esq., and last, though not least, by gerritt smith, esq. these gentlemen have, as i think, fully and clearly vindicated the constitution from any design to support slavery for an hour.\n\nfellow-citizens! there is no matter in respect to which, the people of the north have allowed themselves to be so ruinously imposed upon, as that of the pro-slavery character of the constitution. in that instrument i hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but, interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the constitution is a glorious liberty document. read its preamble, consider its purposes. is slavery among them? is it at the gateway? or is it in the temple? it is neither. while i do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it. what would be thought of an instrument, drawn up, legally drawn up, for the purpose of entitling the city of rochester to a track of land, in which no mention of land was made? now, there are certain rules of interpretation, for the proper understanding of all legal instruments. these rules are well established. they are plain, common-sense rules, such as you and i, and all of us, can understand and apply, without having passed years in the study of law. i scout the idea that the question of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of slavery is not a question for the people. i hold that every american citizen has a fight to form an opinion of the constitution, and to propagate that opinion, and to use all honorable means to make his opinion the prevailing one. without this fight, the liberty of an american citizen would be as insecure as that of a frenchman. ex-vice-president dallas tells us that the constitution is an object to which no american mind can be too attentive, and no american heart too devoted. he further says, the constitution, in its words, is plain and intelligible, and is meant for the home-bred, unsophisticated understandings of our fellow-citizens. senator berrien tell us that the constitution is the fundamental law, that which controls all others. the charter of our liberties, which every citizen has a personal interest in understanding thoroughly. the testimony of senator breese, lewis cass, and many others that might be named, who are everywhere esteemed as sound lawyers, so regard the constitution. i take it, therefore, that it is not presumption in a private citizen to form an opinion of that instrument.\n\nnow, take the constitution according to its plain reading, and i defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it. on the other hand it will be found to contain principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.\n\ni have detained my audience entirely too long already. at some future period i will gladly avail myself of an opportunity to give this subject a full and fair discussion.\n\nallow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture i have this day presented of the state of the nation, i do not despair of this country. there are forces in operation, which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. \"the arm of the lord is not shortened,\" and the doom of slavery is certain. i, therefore, leave off where i began, with hope. while drawing encouragement from the declaration of independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of american institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. no nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. the time was when such could be done. long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. but a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. the arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. it makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. from boston to london is now a holiday excursion. space is comparatively annihilated. thoughts expressed on one side of the atlantic are, distinctly heard on the other. the far off and almost fabulous pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. the celestial empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. the fiat of the almighty, \"let there be light,\" has not yet spent its force. no abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light. the iron shoe, and crippled foot of china must be seen, in contrast with nature. africa must rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. \"ethiopia shall stretch out her hand unto god.\" in the fervent aspirations of william lloyd garrison, i say,\ngod speed the year of jubilee\nthe wide world o'er\nwhen from their galling chains set free,\nth' oppress'd shall vilely bend the knee,\n\nand wear the yoke of tyranny\nlike brutes no more.\nthat year will come, and freedom's reign,\nto man his plundered fights again\nrestore.\n\ngod speed the day when human blood\nshall cease to flow!\nin every clime be understood,\nthe claims of human brotherhood,\nand each return for evil, good,\nnot blow for blow;\nthat day will come all feuds to end.\nand change into a faithful friend\neach foe.\n\ngod speed the hour, the glorious hour,\nwhen none on earth\nshall exercise a lordly power,\nnor in a tyrant's presence cower;\nbut all to manhood's stature tower,\nby equal birth!\nthat hour will come, to each, to all,\nand from his prison-house, the thrall\ngo forth.\n\nuntil that year, day, hour, arrive,\nwith head, and heart, and hand i'll strive,\nto break the rod, and rend the gyve,\nthe spoiler of his prey deprive\u2014\nso witness heaven!\nand never from my chosen post,\nwhate'er the peril or the cost,\nbe driven.","song":"Independent Women Part I","year":2000},{"artist":"Destiny's Child","lyrics":"july 5, 1852\n\nmr. president,\n\nhe who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than i have. i do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more\nshrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than i do this day. a feeling has crept over me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. the task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. i know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. i trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. should i seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me. the little experience i have had in addressing public meetings, in country schoolhouses, avails me nothing on the present occasion.\n\nthe papers and placards say, that i am to deliver a 4th  july oration. this certainly sounds large, and out of the common way, for it is true that i have often had the privilege to speak in this beautiful hall, and to address many who now honor me with their presence. but neither their familiar faces, nor the perfect gage i think i have of corinthian hall, seems to free me from embarrassment.\n\nthe fact is, ladies and gentlemen, the distance between this platform and the slave plantation, from which i escaped, is considerable\u2014and the difficulties to be overcome in getting from the latter to the former, are by no means slight. that i am here to-day is, to me, a matter of astonishment as well as of gratitude. you will not, therefore, be surprised, if in what i have to say i evince no elaborate preparation, nor grace my speech with any high sounding exordium. with little experience and with less learning, i have been able to throw my thoughts hastily and imperfectly together; and trusting to your patient and generous indulgence, i will proceed to lay them before you.\n\nthis, for the purpose of this celebration, is the 4th of july. it is the birthday of your national independence, and of your political freedom. this, to you, is what the passover was to the emancipated people of god. it carries your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance; and to the signs, and to the wonders, associated with that act, and that day. this celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the republic of america is now 76 years old. i am glad, fellow-citizens, that your nation is so young. seventy-six years, though a good old age for a man, is but a mere speck in the life of a nation. three score years and ten is the allotted time for individual men; but nations number their years by thousands. according to this fact, you are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. i repeat, i am glad this is so. there is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon. the eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times; but his heart may well beat lighter at the thought that america is young, and that she is still in the impressible stage of her existence. may he not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? were the nation older, the patriot's heart might be sadder, and the reformer's brow heavier. its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. there is consolation in the thought that america is young. great streams are not easily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages. they may sometimes rise in quiet and stately majesty, and inundate the land, refreshing and fertilizing the earth with their mysterious properties. they may also rise in wrath and fury, and bear away, on their angry waves, the accumulated wealth of years of toil and hardship. they, however, gradually flow back to the same old channel, and flow on as serenely as ever. but, while the river may not be turned aside, it may dry up, and leave nothing behind but the withered branch, and the unsightly rock, to howl in the abyss-sweeping wind, the sad tale of departed glory. as with rivers so with nations.\n\nfellow-citizens, i shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. the simple story of it is that, 76 years ago, the people of this country were british subjects. the style and title of your \"sovereign people\"  was not then born. you were under the british crown. your fathers esteemed the english government as the home government; and england as the fatherland. this home government, you know, although a considerable distance from your home, did, in the exercise of its parental prerogatives, impose upon its colonial children, such restraints, burdens and limitations, as, in its mature judgment, it deemed wise, right and proper.\n\nbut, your fathers, who had not adopted the fashionable idea of this day, of the infallibility of government, and the absolute character of its acts, presumed to differ from the home government in respect to the wisdom and the justice of some of those burdens and restraints. they went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the measures of government unjust, unreasonable, and oppressive, and altogether such as ought not to be quietly submitted to. i scarcely need say, fellow-citizens, that my opinion of those measures fully accords with that of your fathers. such a declaration of agreement on my part would not be worth much to anybody. it would, certainly, prove nothing, as to what part i might have taken, had i lived during the great controversy of 1776. to say now that america was right, and england wrong, is exceedingly easy. everybody can say it; the dastard, not less than the noble brave, can flippantly discant on the tyranny of england towards the american colonies. it is fashionable to do so; but there was a time when to pronounce against england, and in favor of the cause of the colonies, tried men's souls. they who did so were accounted in their day, plotters of mischief, agitators and rebels, dangerous men. to side with the right, against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day. the cause of liberty may be stabbed by the men who glory in the deeds of your fathers. but, to proceed.\n\nfeeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. they petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. this, however, did not answer the purpose. they saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. yet they persevered. they were not the men to look back.\n\nas the sheet anchor takes a firmer hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger, as it breasted the chilling blasts of kingly displeasure. the greatest and best of british statesmen admitted its justice, and the loftiest eloquence of the british senate came to its support. but, with that blindness which seems to be the unvarying characteristic of tyrants, since pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the red sea, the british government persisted in the exactions complained of.\n\nthe madness of this course, we believe, is admitted now, even by england; but we fear the lesson is wholly lost on our present ruler.\n\noppression makes a wise man mad. your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. they felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. with brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! it was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. the timid and the prudent  of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.\n\nsuch people lived then, had lived before, and will, probably, ever have a place on this planet; and their course, in respect to any great change, , may be calculated with as much precision as can be the course of the stars. they hate all changes, but silver, gold and copper change! of this sort of change they are always strongly in favor.\n\nthese people were called tories in the days of your fathers; and the appellation, probably, conveyed the same idea that is meant by a more modern, though a somewhat less euphonious term, which we often find in our papers, applied to some of our old politicians.\n\ntheir opposition to the then dangerous thought was earnest and powerful; but, amid all their terror and affrighted vociferations against it, the alarming and revolutionary idea moved on, and the country with it.\n\non the 2d of july, 1776, the old continental congress, to the dismay of the lovers of ease, and the worshipers of property, clothed that dreadful idea with all the authority of national sanction. they did so in the form of a resolution; and as we seldom hit upon resolutions, drawn up in our day whose transparency is at all equal to this, it may refresh your minds and help my story if i read it. \"resolved, that these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown; and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is, and ought to be, dissolved.\"\n\ncitizens, your fathers made good that resolution. they succeeded; and to-day you reap the fruits of their success. the freedom gained is yours; and you, therefore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. the 4th of july is the first great fact in your nation's history\u2014the very ring-bolt in the chain of your yet undeveloped destiny.\n\npride and patriotism, not less than gratitude, prompt you to celebrate and to hold it in perpetual remembrance. i have said that the declaration of independence is the ring-bolt to the chain of your nation's destiny; so, indeed, i regard it. the principles contained in that instrument are saving principles. stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.\n\nfrom the round top of your ship of state, dark and threatening clouds may be seen. heavy billows, like mountains in the distance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! that bolt drawn, that chain broken, and all is lost. cling to this day\u2014cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.\n\nthe coming into being of a nation, in any circumstances, is an interesting event. but, besides general considerations, there were peculiar circumstances which make the advent of this republic an event of special attractiveness.\n\nthe whole scene, as i look back to it, was simple, dignified and sublime.\n\nthe population of the country, at the time, stood at the insignificant number of three millions. the country was poor in the munitions of war. the population was weak and scattered, and the country a wilderness unsubdued. there were then no means of concert and combination, such as exist now. neither steam nor lightning had then been reduced to order and discipline. from the potomac to the delaware was a journey of many days. under these, and innumerable other disadvantages, your fathers declared for liberty and independence and triumphed.\n\nfellow citizens, i am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. the signers of the declaration of independence were brave men. they were great men too\u2014great enough to give fame to a great age. it does not often happen to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. the point from which i am compelled to view them is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet i cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. they were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, i will unite with you to honor their memory.\n\nthey loved their country better than their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare virtue, and that when it is exhibited, it ought to command respect. he who will, intelligently, lay down his life for his country, is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise. your fathers staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, on the cause of their country. in their admiration of liberty, they lost sight of all other interests.\n\nthey were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. they were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression. they showed forbearance; but that they knew its limits. they believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny. with them, nothing was \"settled\" that was not right. with them, justice, liberty and humanity were \"final;\" not slavery and oppression. you may well cherish the memory of such men. they were great in their day and generation. their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.\n\nhow circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! how unlike the politicians of an hour! their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. they seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defense. mark them!\n\nfully appreciating the hardship to be encountered, firmly believing in the right of their cause, honorably inviting the scrutiny of an on-looking world, reverently appealing to heaven to attest their sincerity, soundly comprehending the solemn responsibility they were about to assume, wisely measuring the terrible odds against them, your fathers, the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep the corner-stone of the national superstructure, which has risen and still rises in grandeur around you.\n\nof this fundamental work, this day is the anniversary. our eyes are met with demonstrations of joyous enthusiasm. banners and pennants wave exultingly on the breeze. the din of business, too, is hushed. even mammon seems to have quitted his grasp on this day. the ear-piercing fife and the stirring drum unite their accents with the ascending peal of a thousand church bells. prayers are made, hymns are sung, and sermons are preached in honor of this day; while the quick martial tramp of a great and multitudinous nation, echoed back by all the hills, valleys and mountains of a vast continent, bespeak the occasion one of thrilling and universal interest\u2014a nation's jubilee.\n\nfriends and citizens, i need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. many of you understand them better than i do. you could instruct me in regard to them. that is a branch of knowledge in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker. the causes which led to the separation of the colonies from the british crown have never lacked for a tongue. they have all been taught in your common schools, narrated at your firesides, unfolded from your pulpits, and thundered from your legislative halls, and are as familiar to you as household words. they form the staple of your national poetry and eloquence.\n\ni remember, also, that, as a people, americans are remarkably familiar with all facts which make in their own favor. this is esteemed by some as a national trait\u2014perhaps a national weakness. it is a fact, that whatever makes for the wealth or for the reputation of americans, and can be had cheap! will be found by americans. i shall not be charged with slandering americans, if i say i think the american side of any question may be safely left in american hands.\n\ni leave, therefore, the great deeds of your fathers to other gentlemen whose claim to have been regularly descended will be less likely to be disputed than mine!\n\nmy business, if i have any here to-day, is with the present. the accepted time with god and his cause is the ever-living now.\ntrust no future, however pleasant,\nlet the dead past bury its dead;\nact, act in the living present,\nheart within, and god overhead.we have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. to all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. but now is the time, the important time. your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. you live and must die, and you must do your work. you have no right to enjoy a child's share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors. you have no right to wear out and waste the hard-earned fame of your fathers to cover your indolence. sydney smith tells us that men seldom eulogize the wisdom and virtues of their fathers, but to excuse some folly or wickedness of their own. this truth is not a doubtful one. there are illustrations of it near and remote, ancient and modern. it was fashionable, hundreds of years ago, for the children of jacob to boast, we have \"abraham to our father,\" when they had long lost abraham's faith and spirit. that people contented themselves under the shadow of abraham's great name, while they repudiated the deeds which made his name great. need i remind you that a similar thing is being done all over this country to-day? need i tell you that the jews are not the only people who built the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepulchres of the righteous? washington could not die till he had broken the chains of his slaves. yet his monument is built up by the price of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men shout\u2014\"we have washington to our father.\"\u2014alas! that it should be so; yet so it is.\nthe evil that men do, lives after them, the good is oft-interred with their bones.fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am i called upon to speak here to-day? what have i, or those i represent, to do with your national independence? are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that declaration of independence, extended to us? and am i, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?\n\nwould to god, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. for who is there so cold, that a nation's sympathy could not warm him? who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation's jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? i am not that man. in a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the \"lame man leap as an hart.\"\n\nbut, such is not the state of the case. i say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. i am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. the blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. \u2014the rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. the sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. this fourth  july is yours, not mine. you may rejoice, i must mourn. to drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? if so, there is a parallel to your conduct. and let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, lowering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! i can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!\n\n\"by the rivers of babylon, there we sat down. yea! we wept when we remembered zion. we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. for there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, sing us one of the songs of zion. how can we sing the lord's song in a strange land? if i forget thee, o jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. if i do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.\"\n\nfellow-citizens; above your national, tumultuous joy, i hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. if i do forget, if i do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, \"may my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\" to forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before god and the world. my subject, then fellow-citizens, is american slavery. i shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave's point of view. standing, there, identified with the american bondman, making his wrongs mine, i do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of july! whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. america is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. standing with god and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, i will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis i can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery\u2014the great sin and shame of america! \"i will not equivocate; i will not excuse;\" i will use the severest language i can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.\n\nbut i fancy i hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. but, i submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. what point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? on what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? must i undertake to prove that the slave is a man? that point is conceded already. nobody doubts it. the slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. they acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. there are seventy-two crimes in the state of virginia, which, if committed by a black man, , subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. what is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual and responsible being? the manhood of the slave is conceded. it is admitted in the fact that southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. when you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field, then i may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. when the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, then will i argue with you that the slave is a man!\n\nfor the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the negro race. is it not astonishing that, while we are ploughing, planting and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in california, capturing the whale in the pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the christian's god, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!\n\nwould you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightful owner of his own body? you have already declared it. must i argue the wrongfulness of slavery? is that a question for republicans? is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood? how should i look to-day, in the presence of americans, dividing, and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? speaking of it relatively, and positively, negatively, and affirmatively. to do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your understanding.\u2014there is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.\n\nwhat, am i to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to bum their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? must i argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? no! i will not. i have better employments for my time and strength than such arguments would imply.\n\nwhat, then, remains to be argued? is it that slavery is not divine; that god did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? there is blasphemy in the thought. that which is inhuman, cannot be divine! who can reason on such a proposition? they that can, may; i cannot. the time for such argument is passed.\n\nat a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. o! had i the ability, and could i reach the nation's ear, i would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. for it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. we need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. the feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against god and man must be proclaimed and denounced.\n\nwhat, to the american slave, is your 4th of july? a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. to him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy\u2014a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. there is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these united states, at this very hour.\n\ngo where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through south america, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, america reigns without a rival.\n\ntake the american slave-trade, which, we are told by the papers, is especially prosperous just now. ex-senator benton tells us that the price of men was never higher than now. he mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. this trade is one of the peculiarities of american institutions. it is carried on in all the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every year, by dealers in this horrid traffic. in several states, this trade is a chief source of wealth. it is called  \"the internal slave trade.\" it is, probably, called so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave-trade is contemplated. that trade has long since been denounced by this government, as piracy. it has been denounced with burning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable traffic. to arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of africa. everywhere, in this country, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave-trade, as a most inhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of god and of man. the duty to extirpate and destroy it, is admitted even by our doctors of divinity. in order to put an end to it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren  should leave this country, and establish themselves on the western coast of africa! it is, however, a notable fact that, while so much execration is poured out by americans upon those engaged in the foreign slave-trade, the men engaged in the slave-trade between the states pass without condemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.\n\nbehold the practical operation of this internal slave-trade, the american slave-trade, sustained by american politics and america religion. here you will see men and women reared like swine for the market. you know what is a swine-drover? i will show you a man-drover. they inhabit all our southern states. they perambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation, with droves of human stock. you will see one of these human flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children, from the potomac to the slave market at new orleans. these wretched people are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. they are food for the cotton-field, and the deadly sugar-mill. mark the sad procession, as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them. hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives! there, see the old man, with locks thinned and gray. cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. see, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping, yes! weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn! the drove moves tardily. heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their strength; suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted with a scream, that seems to have torn its way to the center of your soul! the crack you heard, was the sound of the slave-whip; the scream you heard, was from the woman you saw with the babe. her speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains! that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. follow the drove to new orleans. attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of american slave-buyers. see this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. tell me citizens, where, under the sun, you can witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking. yet this is but a glance at the american slave-trade, as it exists, at this moment, in the ruling part of the united states.\n\ni was born amid such sights and scenes. to me the american slave-trade is a terrible reality. when a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of its horrors. i lived on philpot street, fell's point, baltimore, and have watched from the wharves, the slave ships in the basin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down the chesapeake. there was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of pratt street, by austin woldfolk. his agents were sent into every town and county in maryland, announcing their arrival, through the papers, and on flaming \"hand-bills,\" headed cash for negroes. these men were generally well dressed men, and very captivating in their manners. ever ready to drink, to treat, and to gamble. the fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mother by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.\n\nthe flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, to the general depot at baltimore. when a sufficient number have been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew to mobile, or to new orleans. from the slave prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of night; for since the antislavery agitation, a certain caution is observed.\n\nin the deep still darkness of midnight, i have been often aroused by the dead heavy footsteps, and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door. the anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and i was often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. i was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.\n\nfellow-citizens, this murderous traffic is, to-day, in active operation in this boasted republic. in the solitude of my spirit, i see clouds of dust raised on the highways of the south; i see the bleeding footsteps; i hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave-markets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. there i see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice and rapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. my soul sickens at the sight.\nis this the land your fathers loved,\nthe freedom which they toiled to win?\nis this the earth whereon they moved?\nare these the graves they slumber in?but a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains to be presented. by an act of the american congress, not yet two years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. by that act, mason and dixon's line has been obliterated; new york has become as virginia; and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole united states. the power is co-extensive with the star-spangled banner and american christianity. where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter. where these are, man is not sacred. he is a bird for the sportsman's gun. by that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person of every man are put in peril. your broad republican domain is hunting ground for men. not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime. your lawmakers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this hellish sport. your president, your secretary of state, your lords, nobles, and ecclesiastics, enforce, as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country, and to your god, that you do this accursed thing. not fewer than forty americans have, within the past two years, been hunted down and, without a moment's warning, hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. some of these have had wives and children, dependent on them for bread; but of this, no account was made. the right of the hunter to his prey stands superior to the right of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of god included! for black men there are neither law, justice, humanity, not religion. the fugitive slave law makes mercy to them a crime; and bribes the judge who tries them. an american judge gets ten dollars for every victim he con signs to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so. the oath of any two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! his own testimony is nothing. he can bring no witnesses for himself. the minister of american justice is bound by the law to hear but one side; and that side, is the side of the oppressor. let this damning fact be perpetually told. let it be thundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king-hating, people-loving, democratic, christian america, the seats of justice are filled with judges, who hold their offices under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man's liberty, hear only his accusers!\n\nin glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of administering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless, and in diabolical intent, this fugitive slave law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation. i doubt if there be another nation on the globe, having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. if any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, i will gladly confront him at any suitable time and place he may select.\n\ni take this law to be one of the grossest infringements of christian liberty, and, if the churches and ministers of our country were not stupidly blind, or most wickedly indifferent, they, too, would so regard it.\n\nat the very moment that they are thanking god for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, and for the right to worship god according to the dictates of their own consciences, they are utterly silent in respect to a law which robs religion of its chief significance, and makes it utterly worthless to a world lying in wickedness. did this law concern the \"mint, anise, and cumin\"\u2014abridge the fight to sing psalms, to partake of the sacrament, or to engage in any of the ceremonies of religion, it would be smitten by the thunder of a thousand pulpits. a general shout would go up from the church, demanding repeal, repeal, instant repeal!\u2014and it would go hard with that politician who presumed to solicit the votes of the people without inscribing this motto on his banner. further, if this demand were not complied with, another scotland would be added to the history of religious liberty, and the stern old covenanters would be thrown into the shade. a john knox would be seen at every church door, and heard from every pulpit, and fillmore would have no more quarter than was shown by knox, to the beautiful, but treacherous queen mary of scotland. the fact that the church of our country, , does not esteem \"the fugitive slave law\" as a declaration of war against religious liberty, implies that that church regards religion simply as a form of worship, an empty ceremony, and not a vital principle, requiring active benevolence, justice, love and good will towards man. it esteems sacrifice above mercy; psalm-singing above right doing; solemn meetings above practical righteousness. a worship that can be conducted by persons who refuse to give shelter to the houseless, to give bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and who enjoin obedience to a law forbidding these acts of mercy, is a curse, not a blessing to mankind. the bible addresses all such persons as \"scribes, pharisees, hypocrites, who pay tithe of mint, anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith.\"\n\nbut the church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. it has made itself the bulwark of american slavery, and the shield of american slave-hunters. many of its most eloquent divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the bible to the whole slave system. they have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of god; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the lord jesus christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for christianity.\n\nfor my part, i would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those divines! they convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of thomas paine, voltaire, and bolingbroke, put together, have done! these ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion. they strip the love of god of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. it is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. it is not that \"pure and undefiled religion\" which is from above, and which is \"first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\" but a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes god a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man. all this we affirm to be true of the popular church, and the popular worship of our land and nation \u2013 a religion, a church, and a worship which, on the authority of inspired wisdom, we pronounce to be an abomination in the sight of god. in the language of isaiah, the american church might be well addressed, \"bring no more vain ablations; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, i cannot away with; it is iniquity even the solemn meeting. your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. they are a trouble to me; i am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you. yea! when ye make many prayers, i will not hear. your hands are full of blood; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge for the fatherless; plead for the widow.\"\n\nthe american church is guilty, when viewed in connection with what it is doing to uphold slavery; but it is superlatively guilty when viewed in connection with its ability to abolish slavery. the sin of which it is guilty is one of omission as well as of commission. albert barnes but uttered what the common sense of every man at all observant of the actual state of the case will receive as truth, when he declared that \"there is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.\"\n\nlet the religious press, the pulpit, the sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds; and that they do not do this involves them in the most awful responsibility of which the mind can conceive.\n\nin prosecuting the anti-slavery enterprise, we have been asked to spare the church, to spare the ministry; but how, we ask, could such a thing be done? we are met on the threshold of our efforts for the redemption of the slave, by the church and ministry of the country, in battle arrayed against us; and we are compelled to fight or flee. from what quarter, i beg to know, has proceeded a fire so deadly upon our ranks, during the last two years, as from the northern pulpit? as the champions of oppressors, the chosen men of american theology have appeared\u2014men, honored for their so-called piety, and their real learning. the lords of buffalo, the springs of new york, the lathrops of auburn, the coxes and spencers of brooklyn, the gannets and sharps of boston, the deweys of washington, and other great religious lights of the land have, in utter denial of the authority of him by whom the professed to he called to the ministry, deliberately taught us, against the example or the hebrews and against the remonstrance of the apostles, they teach that we ought to obey man's law before the law of god.\n\nmy spirit wearies of such blasphemy; and how such men can be supported, as the \"standing types and representatives of jesus christ,\" is a mystery which i leave others to penetrate. in speaking of the american church, however, let it be distinctly understood that i mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. there are exceptions, and i thank god that there are. noble men may be found, scattered all over these northern states, of whom henry ward beecher of brooklyn, samuel j. may of syracuse, and my esteemed friend  on the platform, are shining examples; and let me say further, that upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains.\n\none is struck with the difference between the attitude of the american church towards the anti-slavery movement, and that occupied by the churches in england towards a similar movement in that country. there, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, elevating, and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly, bound up the wounds of the west indian slave, and restored him to his liberty. there, the question of emancipation was a high religious question. it was demanded, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living god. the sharps, the clarksons, the wilberforces, the buxtons, and burchells and the knibbs, were alike famous for their piety, and for their philanthropy. the anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement, and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement, when the church of this country shall assume a favorable, instead or a hostile position towards that movement. americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. you boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure christianity, while the whole political power of the nation , is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. you hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of russia and austria, and pride yourselves on your democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of virginia and carolina. you invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. you glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation\u2014a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. you shed tears over fallen hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the american slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! you are all on fire at the mention of liberty for france or for ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of america. you discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. you can bare your bosom to the storm of british artillery to throw off a threepenny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. you profess to believe \"that, of one blood, god made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,\" and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, , all men whose skins are not colored like your own. you declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you \"hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;\" and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own thomas jefferson, \"is worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,\" a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.\n\nfellow-citizens! i will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. the existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your christianity as a lie. it destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. it saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a by word to a mocking earth. it is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your union. it fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it, as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. oh! be warned! be warned! a horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation's bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of god, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!\n\nbut it is answered in reply to all this, that precisely what i have now denounced is, in fact, guaranteed and sanctioned by the constitution of the united states; that the right to hold and to hunt slaves is a part of that constitution framed by the illustrious fathers of this republic.\n\nthen, i dare to affirm, notwithstanding all i have said before, your fathers stooped, basely stooped\n\nand keep the word of promise to the ear,\nbut break it to the heart.and instead of being the honest men i have before declared them to be, they were the veriest imposters that ever practiced on mankind. this is the inevitable conclusion, and from it there is no escape. but i differ from those who charge this baseness on the framers of the constitution of the united states. it is a slander upon their memory, at least, so i believe. there is not time now to argue the constitutional question at length \u2013 nor have i the ability to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. the subject has been handled with masterly power by lysander spooner, esq., by william goodell, by samuel e. sewall, esq., and last, though not least, by gerritt smith, esq. these gentlemen have, as i think, fully and clearly vindicated the constitution from any design to support slavery for an hour.\n\nfellow-citizens! there is no matter in respect to which, the people of the north have allowed themselves to be so ruinously imposed upon, as that of the pro-slavery character of the constitution. in that instrument i hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but, interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the constitution is a glorious liberty document. read its preamble, consider its purposes. is slavery among them? is it at the gateway? or is it in the temple? it is neither. while i do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it. what would be thought of an instrument, drawn up, legally drawn up, for the purpose of entitling the city of rochester to a track of land, in which no mention of land was made? now, there are certain rules of interpretation, for the proper understanding of all legal instruments. these rules are well established. they are plain, common-sense rules, such as you and i, and all of us, can understand and apply, without having passed years in the study of law. i scout the idea that the question of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of slavery is not a question for the people. i hold that every american citizen has a fight to form an opinion of the constitution, and to propagate that opinion, and to use all honorable means to make his opinion the prevailing one. without this fight, the liberty of an american citizen would be as insecure as that of a frenchman. ex-vice-president dallas tells us that the constitution is an object to which no american mind can be too attentive, and no american heart too devoted. he further says, the constitution, in its words, is plain and intelligible, and is meant for the home-bred, unsophisticated understandings of our fellow-citizens. senator berrien tell us that the constitution is the fundamental law, that which controls all others. the charter of our liberties, which every citizen has a personal interest in understanding thoroughly. the testimony of senator breese, lewis cass, and many others that might be named, who are everywhere esteemed as sound lawyers, so regard the constitution. i take it, therefore, that it is not presumption in a private citizen to form an opinion of that instrument.\n\nnow, take the constitution according to its plain reading, and i defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it. on the other hand it will be found to contain principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.\n\ni have detained my audience entirely too long already. at some future period i will gladly avail myself of an opportunity to give this subject a full and fair discussion.\n\nallow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture i have this day presented of the state of the nation, i do not despair of this country. there are forces in operation, which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. \"the arm of the lord is not shortened,\" and the doom of slavery is certain. i, therefore, leave off where i began, with hope. while drawing encouragement from the declaration of independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of american institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. no nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. the time was when such could be done. long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. but a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. the arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. it makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. from boston to london is now a holiday excursion. space is comparatively annihilated. thoughts expressed on one side of the atlantic are, distinctly heard on the other. the far off and almost fabulous pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. the celestial empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. the fiat of the almighty, \"let there be light,\" has not yet spent its force. no abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light. the iron shoe, and crippled foot of china must be seen, in contrast with nature. africa must rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. \"ethiopia shall stretch out her hand unto god.\" in the fervent aspirations of william lloyd garrison, i say,\ngod speed the year of jubilee\nthe wide world o'er\nwhen from their galling chains set free,\nth' oppress'd shall vilely bend the knee,\n\nand wear the yoke of tyranny\nlike brutes no more.\nthat year will come, and freedom's reign,\nto man his plundered fights again\nrestore.\n\ngod speed the day when human blood\nshall cease to flow!\nin every clime be understood,\nthe claims of human brotherhood,\nand each return for evil, good,\nnot blow for blow;\nthat day will come all feuds to end.\nand change into a faithful friend\neach foe.\n\ngod speed the hour, the glorious hour,\nwhen none on earth\nshall exercise a lordly power,\nnor in a tyrant's presence cower;\nbut all to manhood's stature tower,\nby equal birth!\nthat hour will come, to each, to all,\nand from his prison-house, the thrall\ngo forth.\n\nuntil that year, day, hour, arrive,\nwith head, and heart, and hand i'll strive,\nto break the rod, and rend the gyve,\nthe spoiler of his prey deprive\u2014\nso witness heaven!\nand never from my chosen post,\nwhate'er the peril or the cost,\nbe driven.","song":"Independent Women Part

let's talk about ja rule. yeah\u2026 remember him?\n\nwell, if you do, you, you'll remember that he was one of the more successful 2pac knock-offs that tried to capatilize off of his likeness in the aftermath of his death, as made obvious by the bald head, red bandana, and perpetual shirtlessness, but whereas 2pac's musical material, no matter how controversial or disagreeable, at least came across as genuine, intricate, insights of a man trying to sort out his world, ja rule's music came across as very\u2026 watered down, to say the least\n\nfirst of all, he sang way too much for a hardcore thug, as he kept claiming to be. secondly, he sang way too much for someone who can't sing. *montage of ja rule singing* and third, he had all of the mannerisms of 2pac with absolutely none of the substance. and fourth, we already had a late 90's, eastcoast version of 2pac. his name was dmx!\n\nand this is a comparison that must be noted, because not only did dmx arrive on the scene about a year before ja rule, but he also had an energy, griminess, and passion in his rhymes that made ja rule look like a corny knock off. x had diversity in his topics, ranging from hardcore anthems to tracks about multiple personalities to songs detailing his life like \"slippin'\". his material was not only more clever and diverse, but also grittier, making you believe every word he viciously growled. that, coupled with the fact that, in 1998, both his first and second albums went number one in the same year, and you can bet your ass people were trying to imitate the formula. not by trying to achieve the same intensity or ability as dmx, but by taking his exact aesthetic, and watering it down to hell\n\nnow, ja and dmx were actually cool with each other at first, that is until right around the release of his second album,36, which is about the time ja started going from run-of-the- the \"thugs need love too\" songs. these were ja rule' songs with females on the , in return, spits rhymes about hardcore sex and how much of a gangsta and playa he still is, despite his relationship with her. by the end of 2002, there was a never-ending torrent of \"i wanna be gangsta for the fellas and lovey-dovey for the ladies\" songs that dominated the airwaves for a while, the biggest single of which was \"always on time\", which is pretty much the first and last song from him that you really needed to hear when it comes to this topic. everything that's done right and wrong is on this song, and mostly, it's done wrong, so let's check it out\n\n\"always there when you call , always on time\"\n\nright there! that's exactly what i'm talking about. smooth, r and b singer crooning about love for the girls, but we've still gotta be hardcore, so i gotta talk about shooting guns!... despite the fact that that has nothing to do with the mood she's trying to set. like, in reality, this wouldn't work\n\n*singing* yeah, boy, you know i love you! tell me what you say to that! *pause* *guns go off* holy shit! what the fuck!\n\n\"gave you my.... baby be mine\"\nwhat\u2026 what did you give him?\n\"and i gave you my all, now baby be mine\"\n\noh\u2026 why was that edited out the first time? did the first take have a\u2026 different word there?\n\n\"gave you my....\" *...you know\u2026 \"baby be mine\"\n\nalthough, the word she actually says here is \"i gave you my all\", but then she says, \"now baby, be mine\". and, seeing that the context is, \"yeah, i don't always answer my phone, but when you need me, i'm there, giving you my \"all\" and since, after giving him her \"all\", she still doesn't know whether or not he wants to be with her, i'm going to forgo any thought that she's talking about spending quality time together as a loving couple and just assuming she's talking about her\u2026 you know\u2026\n\nbut, it's just innocuously worded enough that someone could interpret it in a more innocent context, and that' you can easily deduce a sexual or emotional context from what they're saying. however, when the verses are coming from a rapper who's still trying to be hardcore\u2026\n\n\"c'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover\nyou know, the one that swing dick like no other\"\n\ngoodbye, subtlety\u2026\n\n\"i know, i got a lot of things i need to explain\nbut baby you know the name and love is about pain\"\n\nyeah, i know i've done very disrespectful things to you in the past, but, hey, you know who i am! i'm a rich rapper! and besides, love is supposed to be about being hurt. that's why i'm doing things that hurt you! i'm only trying to verify the enduring power of our love!\n\n\"so, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints\"\n\nyeah, so just sign these papers that will nullify your restraining order and\u2026 whha?!\n\n\"hold down on the bed while i'm yankin your braids\"\n\ni'm sorry, did you mention something about a restraining order a little while ago?\n\n\"thug style, you never thought i'd make you smile\"\n\ni guess not! she had a freaking restraining order on you! look, i understand that people get into relationship problems, but if it's come to the point of trying to legally restrict a person from being near you, we've tread into some dangerous territory\n\n\"while i'm smackin you fast and hittin you all wild\"\n\nthat line about restraining orders is really ruining the rest of this song\n\n\" but we share somethin so rare,\"\n\nyes, most couples don't have what we have between us, namely a document stating that we can't be within 100 feet of each other\n\n\"but who cares?\"\n\nthe court that drafted it?\n\n\"baby, i'm not always there when you call, but i'm always on time\"\n\nare you still singing this ? why do you like this guy? he's obviously not worth your time!\n\n\"girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together\"\n\nsee, even ja rule wants you to get over him! he's done nothing to illustrate why he's not a good person! like he said, get a grip!\n\nit's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather\"\n\noh wait, was he saying \"pull it together\" and \"get a grip\" because he wants her to overlook his shortcomings, because they've \"been through worse\", as he says? my bad, i guess. i thought he was having a moment of clarity, realizing he was a horrible person and telling her to move on from him. but what a foolish presumption, because most of these songs are about how \"girl, you know that i'm a bad boy, and you like the fact that i'm a bad boy, and we're terrible for each other, but we just can't stay away from each other, because we love the fact that we're not supposed to be together *points finger in mouth* and blegh! you know, where wale handled this topic with nuance and gave the proper weight to the subject, ja rule's songs exploit that angle, and that's what annoys me. the way this , it treats the topic with no gravity whatsoever, and tries to make the whole thing cute while ja's lyrics in the verses outline just how stupid it really is\n\n\"like the stormy nights you wrote a \"dear ja\" letter\nand took my benz and keyed and cut the leather\"\n\nokay, here's an instance where she did something pretty crappy to him, but i'm fairly sure that she did this in response to something he did\n\n\"bitch, you know better, we live m-o-b\nmoney over bitches\"\n\nyou know, like casually referring to her as a bitch, or living by the phrase \"m.o.b.\", which means that he values money and material items over bitches, a derogatory term that he just called her, as in \"why did you cut up my car? don't you remember? i value material items more than i value you! see, this is why things aren't working out! you don't understand me!\"\n\n\"i got two or three hoes for every v\"\n\nor, you could look at the fact that he sees no shame in telling you that he has other girls\n\n\"and i keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy\"\n\nand he keeps them high off of drugs to incapacitate them\u2026 like a pimp or\u2026 wait, is this song about a pimp and his relationship with a prostitute? yeah, dude, i think it is! i mean, listen to that !\n\n\"i'm not always there when you call, but i'm always on time\"\n\nthat's something a prostitute would say to her pimp, \"yeah daddy, i may not always answer my phone, but i'm always on time with my money!\" dear god, why didn't i see it before!\n\n\"believe me, this pimp game is very religious\"\n\nseriously, why didn't i notice this? this is basically a song about how a pimp makes a girl feel special so that she'll sell her body for him, and ashanti is the chick who's going for it! i mean, if that isn't what this song is about, and ja rule writing a love song can be this easily misconstrued as a pimp-ho relationship, well, i guess that just shows how terrible he is at it\n\n\"i play hard, there's so many women i fathered\"\n\nwait, \"fathering\" someone means that you've been a father to a person. so, you're bragging about the fact that you have a lot of daughters? i mean, contextually, this should be another line about how many women you've had sex with, but if you're saying you \"fathered\" them, that verb specifically means to be a father to someone, so\u2026 unless raising multiple daughters was a thing that rappers bragged about in the early 2000's, this line is very wrongly worded\n\n\"oh i'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life\ncause you don't be comin home, sometimes\"\n\nhold on, so now, ja rule is the one concerned about her faithfulness? you just told us that you have two hoes for every car you own. as far as we know, you're the only one who's had sex with anyone else, so excuse me if i don't show sympathy to your speculations that probably arise from the fact that you're afraid your girlfriend might have the exact same morality code as you!\n\nand you could say that this is a lust song, that's it's not meant to be taken as a song about intimate relationships as much as sexual attraction, but then what'\n\n\"but we share something so rare\nbut who cares, you care\"\n\ndude, i know what this really is. this isn't a morally elusive song for the purpose of telling us a real story about two people struggling between lust and genuine attraction, this is a morally elusive song for the purpose of fooling girls into thinking he has a softer side to make them believe he'll treat them special, all the while flagging the \"but i'm a complicated thug\" card that's supposed to make it okay for him to have sex with other women because he \"just doesn't want to be committed yet\"!\n\nit's obvious, it's manipulative, and it's a perfect example of why i don't like these songs when they're done this way. and that's not to say that i don't like rap love songs in general, or that hardcore rappers shouldn't make love songs. it can be done right. look at the quintessential \"thugs need love too\" song, \"all i need\" by method man\n\n\"back when i was nothing you made a brother feel like he was somethin\nthat's why i'm with you to this day boo no frontin\neven when the skies were gray you would rub me on my back and say \"baby it'll be okay\"\"\n\nthis is a great example of a rap love song that doesn't come across as either corny or pandering\n\n\"i'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck wit me\nbut you did, now i'm going all out kid and i got mad love to give,\"\n\nsure, to some people, this may not sound super romantic and sweet, but this brand of hiphop isn' it's raw, it's reality, and it sounds authentic, and it doesn't need to be sugar-coated, which is what they did for \"always on time\", to cover up the fact that it's not about love, it's about manipulating women into thinking that ja rule gives a crap about you, and it barely bothers to hide it. sorry, but i just hate the mood of this song. ashanti here is desperately trying to get her to love him, begging him to be hers, and the only thing he does is talk about how awesome he is. it's annoyingly lop-sided in regards to who's giving them self to the other. i'd give this song a 1 out of 5, because, you know, ashanti was an okay singer\n\ni'm the rap critic. you don't have to like my opinion, but i don't have to like your

ja rule. now, as previously stated in another episode, ja rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, ja rule had it all. but, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the \"thugs need love too\" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. hit song after hit song, his \"pop gangster\" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this \"pop rapper\" \"a studio thug\" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. that man was mr. curtis jackson, a.k.a. 50 cent. he'd call out ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out ja* sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and ja rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of ja rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with\u2026 *\"in da club\" and \"21 questions\"*\u2026 with club songs and love songs\u2026 well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing \"21 questions\", the love song i wanted to look at today\n\nwhen asked by dr. \"how you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?\"\n\n50 i'm two people. i've always had to be two people since i was a kid, to get by. to me that's not diversity, it's necessity\n\nand you know what, i can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you do have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. you can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next\u2026 well, wait a minute, if that's true, mr. i'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on ja rule so much when he made love songs? what is he not allowed to have his own dichotomy? that seems a little unfair. reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with kanye west, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *clips of him performing kanye's song, \"i line niggas'*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with g-unit?\n\n*\"rider, part 2\"*\n\noh yeah, yeah\u2026\n\nso you see, my thing about 50 cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that i might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. but 50 cent? yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh\u2026 spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because\u2026 that's what everyone was waiting for!\n\nbut i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe i should give him a chance. after all, it's not just making a \"thugs need love too\" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a bad song that makes me not like one, so let's check out \"21 questions\" by 50 cent, and see how it fares\n\n*intro*\n\noh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?\n\n*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*\n\n*laugh* yes, i echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money\n\n*police arrive*\n\noh no, the cops! maybe making all those songs in which i publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!\n\n*cops come in, song starts*\n\n*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*\n\n\"new york city! you are now riding\u2026 with 50 cent!\n\nwell, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. i wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour\n\nyou gotta love it!\n\npersonally, i think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever\n\ni just want to chill and twist the lye\ncatch stunts in my 745\n\ni just wanna let you know before this love song starts that i'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!\n\ngirl, it's easy to love me now\n\nand, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to isaac hayes, mr. nate dogg on the \nwould you love me if i was down and out?\nwould you still have love for me?\n\nand i gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of \"i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch\". instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. he wants someone who's interested in more than money\u2026 despite what the intro may lead you to believe\n\nif i fell off tomorrow would you still love me?\n\n if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? it's straight up and to the point. and i wish he would have started with this instead of the \"riding in my car, smoking weed\" nonsense\n\nif i got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century\ncould i count on you to be there to support me mentally?\n\nyou know, for most \"thugs need love too\" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. and the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it\n\nif i was hit and i was hurt would you be by my side?\n\nalso, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about\n\nif it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?\n\nokay, that's kinda vague. you might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...\n\ni get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive\n\nokay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. got it\n\ni'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside\n\nyeah, he's asking questions about how you feel inside, specifically about being an accomplice to murder\n\nnow would you leave me if your father found out i was thugging?\n\nwould that be before or after you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?\n\nare you mad cause i'm asking you 21 questions?\n\nuh\u2026 does that count as one of the questions? because now it sounds like you're trolling her. you mad i'm asking' you 21 questions? yo mad, bruh?\n\ndo you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?\n\nnow this is a deep question, and the wording is important. do you trust me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---\n\ni'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans\n\n\u2026and\u2026 and that was a bad transition. i don't even think that was a question, you just said, \"baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of that apple bottom ass\u2026 also, ya dreams, and shit...\n\nif i was with some other chick and someone happened to see\n\nokay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit i try to give this song. listen to the whole thing\n\nif i was with some other chick and someone happened to see\nand when you asked me about it i said it wasn't me\nwould you believe me or up and leave me?\nhow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\n\nyeah, this always got to me. he says, \"if someone saw me with another girl, not if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, if it was true that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him.\" to be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. and what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on her\n\nwould you believe me or up and leave me?\nhow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\n\nyes, 50 cent' after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly you who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!\n\nyeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids\n\ni love you like a fat kid loves cake\nyou know my style, i'll say anything to make you smile\n\nyeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling\n\nwe're only humans, girl, we make mistakes\nto make it up, i'll do whatever it takes\ni love you lil a fat kid loves cake\n\nand that' in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me\n\noverall, though, i'd give this song a 3 out of 5. never underestimate the power of nate dogg's vocals, my friends. and in addition, 50 cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable. yes, it has parts that turn me off of it, but i say in the end, this songs gets a pass from me. and to his credit, at least he didn't pull a ja rule, *play \"always on time\"* and make a quote unquote \"love song\" that, in a sickening revelation, was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship. no, 50 cent was pretty upfront when he made that song\n\n*\"cause i' m a mothefuckin'
