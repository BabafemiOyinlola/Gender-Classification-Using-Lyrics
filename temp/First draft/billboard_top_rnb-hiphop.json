The camera pans down a gigantic pillar of sand leading to an underground city.

That explains why it didn't taste right.\n\nFinn: Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.\n\nJake: That's how I feel\u2014like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon.\n\nFinn: Um... [looks at the spoon on top of the column] nothing. [The spoon is lifted up and comes down.] Wait, there she goes!\n\nMarceline: [invisible] Yo, wake up, sand dude. [taps a sand soldier with the spoon, causing the sculpture to crumble.] I think they're dead. [brings spoon over to Finn and becomes visible] A spoon.\n\nFinn: [takes spoon] Yea-uh.

[starts sinking in the sand]\n\nMarceline: Is that quicksand?\n\nJake: Yeah! [laughs] [tries to get out several times but keeps falling back] Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.\n\nFinn: Quit messing around, Jake.\n\nJake: Okie-doke.\n\n[Jake stretches an arm from his head to the support underneath the platform Finn and Marceline are on.

Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?\n\nMarceline: Sure looks that way.\n\nJake: Uh, give me a pull, please.

That way, you won't be scared.\n\nJake: And that will keep you from draining my bloods?\n\nMarceline: Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.\n\nJake: [gulps] [whispers] Hurry, Finn.\n\n[Scene cuts to Finn passing some streams of lava.]\n\nFinn: Red, red, red.

[points to red glow] Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm. [looks at skeletons] Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster. [walks up to door] 'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah! [kicks the door, which collapses] Oh, dag.\n\n[Finn looks into a room full of immobile sand people bathing in the red light coming from a crown on a skeleton at the other side of the room.]\n\nFinn: Cool... What the heck happened here? [grabs a hat from one of the skeletons] Whoop! [throws hat in the red light, which turns it to sand] Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this. [walks along the edge of the room] Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm... [sees that the source of the light is coming from a hole behind the skeleton] Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?\n\n[The skeleton does not respond.]\n\nFinn: Okay. I was just making sure. [crawls into hole] Bet that guy was a creep. [continues crawling] This hole is deep.\n\n[Scene cuts back to Jake.]\n\nJake: Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out!\n\nMarceline: Jaaaake...\n\nJake: What?\n\nMarceline: I can smell your insides, Jake. [laughs] They smell...

Well, I've already gone this far. [reaches the end of the tunnel, where a red gem is shining light] Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un... [notices that the red light is coming from a large turtle creature behind the gem] Oops.\n\nCrab Demon: Paris?

How long?\n\nFinn: Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.\n\nCrab Demon: [in disbelief] Five hundred\u2014[sighs] Chum! I must've zoned out!\n\nFinn: What the heck were you two doing?\n\nCrab Demon: Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet.\n\nFinn: Hm, that's dumb.\n\nCrab Demon: Time to go back home a true loser.\n\nFinn: Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?\n\nCrab Demon: That's an emerald.\n\nFinn: Clearly it's a big ol' ruby.\n\nCrab Demon: I don't know what to tell you, man.\n\nFinn: I would like the ruby.\n\nCrab Demon: It's yours, buddy.

That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist.\n\nMarceline: You're gonna eat me?\n\nJake: You was gonna eat me!\n\nMarceline: Yes, I am.

Check out this ruby I got.\n\nJake: That's an emerald, dude.\n\nFinn: You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.\n\nJake: This thing is green.\n\nFinn: Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!\n\nJake: You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!\n\n[The \"ruby\" is now green.]\n\nFinn: Oh... whoops.\n\nJake: I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.\n\nFinn: Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?\n\nJake: She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice.\n\n[Marceline is now missing.]\n\nJake: I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What?

out the fellas to tell 'em who's best\nRiding around in your Jeep or your Benzos\nOr in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos\nBack in Philly we be out in the park\nA place called the Plateau is where everybody goes\nGuys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise\nHonkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes\nShe turn around to see what you beepin' at\nIt's like the summer's a natural

friends cause y'all reminisce\nAbout the days growin' up and the first person you kiss\nAnd as I think back makes me wonder how\nThe smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia\nAll the kids playin' out front\nLittle boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch\nWhile the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion\nThen six o'clock rolls around\nYou just finished wipin' your car down\nIt's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout\nIt looks like a car show\nEverybody come lookin' real fine\nFresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon\nEvery moment frontin' and maxin'\nChillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'\nLeanin' to the side but you can't speed through\nTwo miles an hour so everybody sees you\nThere's an air of love

see a view of Padua; a large canopy is set (R.C.) with three thrones, one a little lower than the others; the ceiling is made of long gilded beams; furniture of the period, chairs covered with gilt leather, and buffets set with gold and silver plate, and chests painted with mythological scenes. A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down into the street below; from the street comes the roar of a mob and cries of \u2018Death to the Duke\u2019: after a little interval enter the Duke very calmly; he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti; with him enters also the Lord Cardinal; the mob still shouting.\n\nDUKE\nNo, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!\nWhy, she is worse than ugly, she is good.\n\nMAFFIO\n[excitedly]\nYour Grace, there are two thousand people there\nWho every moment grow more clamorous.\n\nDUKE\nTut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!\nPeople who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;\nThe only men I fear are silent men.\n[A yell from the people.]\nYou see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.\n[Another yell.] Go, Petrucci,\nAnd tell the captain of the guard below\nTo clear the square.

Which of these lords\nAnd noble gentlemen of Padua\nStands by your side.\n\nDUCHESS\nThere is not one.\n\n[GUIDO starts, but restrains himself.]\n\nDUKE\nNor shall be,\nWhile I am Duke in Padua: listen, Madam,\nBeing mine own, you shall do as I will,\nAnd if it be my will you keep the house,\nWhy then, this palace shall your prison be;\nAnd if it be my will you walk abroad,\nWhy, you shall take the air from morn to night.\n\nDUCHESS\nSir, by what right -?\n\nDUKE\nMadam, my second Duchess\nAsked the same question once: her monument\nLies in the chapel of Bartholomew,\nWrought in red marble; very beautiful.\nGuido, your arm. Come, gentlemen, let us go\nAnd spur our falcons for the mid-day chase.\nBethink you, Madam, you are here alone.\n[Exit the DUKE leaning on GUIDO, with his Court.]\n\nDUCHESS\n[looking after them]\nThe Duke said rightly that I was alone;\nDeserted, and dishonoured, and defamed,\nStood ever woman so alone indeed?\nMen when they woo us call us pretty children,\nTell us we have not wit to make our lives,\nAnd so they mar them for us. Did I say woo?\nWe are their chattels, and their common slaves,\nLess dear than the poor hound that licks their hand,\nLess fondled than the hawk upon their wrist.\nWoo, did I say? bought rather, sold and bartered,\nOur very bodies being merchandise.\nI know it is the general lot of women,\nEach miserably mated to some man\nWrecks her own life upon his selfishness:\nThat it is general makes it not less bitter.\nI think I never heard a woman laugh,\nLaugh for pure merriment, except one woman,\nThat was at night time, in the public streets.\nPoor soul, she walked with painted lips, and wore\nThe mask of pleasure: I would not laugh like her;\nNo, death were better.\n[Enter GUIDO behind unobserved; the DUCHESS flings herself down before a picture of the Madonna.]\nO Mary mother, with your sweet pale face\nBending between the little angel heads\nThat hover round you, have you no help for me?\nMother of God, have you no help for me?\n\nGUIDO\nI can endure no longer.\nThis is my love, and I will speak to her.\nLady, am I a stranger to your prayers?\n\nDUCHESS\n[rising]\nNone but the wretched needs my prayers, my lord.\n\nGUIDO\nThen must I need them, lady.\n\nDUCHESS\nHow is that?\nDoes not the Duke show thee sufficient honour?\n\nGUIDO\nYour Grace, I lack no favours from the Duke,\nWhom my soul loathes as I loathe wickedness,\nBut come to proffer on my bended knees,\nMy loyal service to thee unto death.\n\nDUCHESS\nAlas! I am so fallen in estate\nI can but give thee a poor meed of thanks.\n\nGUIDO\n[seizing her hand]\nHast thou no love to give me?\n[The DUCHESS starts, and GUIDO falls at her feet.]\nO dear saint,\nIf I have been too daring, pardon me!\nThy beauty sets my boyish blood aflame,\nAnd, when my reverent lips touch thy white hand,\nEach little nerve with such wild passion thrills\nThat there is nothing which I would not do\nTo gain thy love. [Leaps up.]\nBid me reach forth and pluck\nPerilous honour from the lion\u2019s jaws,\nAnd I will wrestle with the Nemean beast\nOn the bare desert! Fling to the cave of War\nA gaud, a ribbon, a dead flower, something\nThat once has touched thee, and I\u2019ll bring it back\nThough all the hosts of Christendom were there,\nInviolate again! ay, more than this,\nSet me to scale the pallid white-faced cliffs\nOf mighty England, and from that arrogant shield\nWill I raze out the lilies of your France\nWhich England, that sea-lion of the sea,\nHath taken from her!\nO dear Beatrice,\nDrive me not from thy presence! without thee\nThe heavy minutes crawl with feet of lead,\nBut, while I look upon thy loveliness,\nThe hours fly like winged Mercuries\nAnd leave existence golden.\n\nDUCHESS\nI did not think\nI should be ever loved: do you indeed\nLove me so much as now you say you do?\n\nGUIDO\nAsk of the sea-bird if it loves the sea,\nAsk of the roses if they love the rain,\nAsk of the little lark, that will not sing\nTill day break, if it loves to see the day:-\nAnd yet, these are but empty images,\nMere shadows of my love, which is a fire\nSo great that all the waters of the main\nCan not avail to quench it. Will you not speak?\n\nDUCHESS\nI hardly know what I should say to you.\n\nGUIDO\nWill you not say you love me?\n\nDUCHESS\nIs that my lesson?\nMust I say all at once? \u2019Twere a good lesson\nIf I did love you, sir; but, if I do not,\nWhat shall I say then?\n\nGUIDO\nIf you do not love me,\nSay, none the less, you do, for on your tongue\nFalsehood for very shame would turn to truth.\n\nDUCHESS\nWhat if I do not speak at all? They say\nLovers are happiest when they are in doubt\n\nGUIDO\nNay, doubt would kill me, and if I must die,\nWhy, let me die for joy and not for doubt.\nOh, tell me may I stay, or must I go?\n\nDUCHESS\nI would not have you either stay or go;\nFor if you stay you steal my love from me,\nAnd if you go you take my love away.\nGuido, though all the morning stars could sing\nThey could not tell the measure of my love.\nI love you, Guido.\n\nGUIDO\n[stretching out his hands]\nOh, do not cease at all;\nI thought the nightingale sang but at night;\nOr if thou needst must cease, then let my lips\nTouch the sweet lips that can such music make.\n\nDUCHESS\nTo touch my lips is not to touch my heart.\n\nGUIDO\nDo you close that against me?\n\nDUCHESS\nAlas! my lord,\nI have it not: the first day that I saw you\nI let you take my heart away from me;\nUnwilling thief, that without meaning it\nDid break into my fenced treasury\nAnd filch my jewel from it! O strange theft,\nWhich made you richer though you knew it not,\nAnd left me poorer, and yet glad of it!\n\nGUIDO\n[clasping her in his arms]\nO love, love, love! Nay, sweet, lift up your head,\nLet me unlock those little scarlet doors\nThat shut in music, let me dive for coral\nIn your red lips, and I\u2019ll bear back a prize\nRicher than all the gold the Gryphon guards\nIn rude Armenia.\n\nDUCHESS\nYou are my lord,\nAnd what I have is yours, and what I have not\nYour fancy lends me, like a prodigal\nSpending its wealth on what is nothing worth.\n[Kisses him.]\n\nGUIDO\nMethinks I am bold to look upon you thus:\nThe gentle violet hides beneath its leaf\nAnd is afraid to look at the great sun\nFor fear of too much splendour, but my eyes,\nO daring eyes! are grown so venturous\nThat like fixed stars they stand, gazing at you,\nAnd surfeit sense with beauty.\n\nDUCHESS\nDear love, I would\nYou could look upon me ever, for your eyes\nAre polished mirrors, and when I peer\nInto those mirrors I can see myself,\nAnd so I know my image lives in you.\n\nGUIDO\n[taking her in his arms]\nStand still, thou hurrying orb in the high heavens,\nAnd make this hour immortal! [A pause.]\n\nDUCHESS\nSit down here,\nA little lower than me: yes, just so, sweet,\nThat I may run my fingers through your hair,\nAnd see your face turn upwards like a flower\nTo meet my kiss.\nHave you not sometimes noted,\nWhen we unlock some long-disus\u00e9d room\nWith heavy dust and soiling mildew filled,\nWhere never foot of man has come for years,\nAnd from the windows take the rusty bar,\nAnd fling the broken shutters to the air,\nAnd let the bright sun in, how the good sun\nTurns every grimy particle of dust\nInto a little thing of dancing gold?\nGuido, my heart is that long-empty room,\nBut you have let love in, and with its gold\nGilded all life. Do you not think that love\nFills up the sum of life?\n\nGUIDO\nAy! without love\nLife is no better than the unhewn stone\nWhich in the quarry lies, before the sculptor\nHas set the God within it. Without love\nLife is as silent as the common reeds\nThat through the marshes or by rivers grow,\nAnd have no music in them.\n\nDUCHESS\nYet out of these\nThe singer, who is Love, will make a pipe\nAnd from them he draws music; so I think\nLove will bring music out of any life.\nIs that not true?\n\nGUIDO\nSweet, women make it true.\nThere are men who paint pictures, and carve statues,\nPaul of Verona and the dyer\u2019s son,\nOr their great rival, who, by the sea at Venice,\nHas set God\u2019s little maid upon the stair,\nWhite as her own white lily, and as tall,\nOr Raphael, whose Madonnas are divine\nBecause they are mothers merely; yet I think\nWomen are the best artists of the world,\nFor they can take the common lives of men\nSoiled with the money-getting of our age,\nAnd with love make them beautiful.\n\nDUCHESS\nAh, dear,\nI wish that you and I were very poor;\nThe poor, who love each other, are so rich.\n\nGUIDO\nTell me again you love me, Beatrice.\n\nDUCHESS\n[fingering his collar]\nHow well this collar lies about your throat.\n[LORD MORANZONE looks through the door from the corridor outside.]\n\nGUIDO\nNay, tell me that you love me.\n\nDUCHESS\nI remember,\nThat when I was a child in my dear France,\nBeing at Court at Fontainebleau, the King\nWore such a collar.\n\nGUIDO\nWill you not say you love me?\n\nDUCHESS\n[smiling]\nHe was a very royal man, King Francis,\nYet he was not royal as you are.\nWhy need I tell you, Guido, that I love you?\n[Takes his head in her hands and turns his face up to her.]\nDo you not know that I am yours for ever,\nBody and soul?\n[Kisses him, and then suddenly catches sight of MORANZONE and leaps up.]\nOh, what is that? [MORANZONE disappears.]\n\nGUIDO\nWhat, love?\n\nDUCHESS\nMethought I saw a face with eyes of flame\nLook at us through the doorway.\n\nGUIDO\nNay, \u2019twas nothing:\nThe passing shadow of the man on guard.\n[The DUCHESS still stands looking at the window.]\n\u2019Twas nothing, sweet.\n\nDUCHESS\nAy! what can harm us now,\nWho are in Love\u2019s hand? I do not think I\u2019d care\nThough the vile world should with its lackey Slander\nTrample and tread upon my life; why should I?\nThey say the common field-flowers of the field\nHave sweeter scent when they are trodden on\nThan when they bloom alone, and that some herbs\nWhich have no perfume, on being bruis\u00e9d die\nWith all Arabia round them; so it is\nWith the young lives this dull world seeks to crush,\nIt does but bring the sweetness out of them,\nAnd makes them lovelier often. And besides,\nWhile we have love we have the best of life:\nIs it not so?\n\nGUIDO\nDear, shall we play or sing?\nI think that I could sing now.\n\nDUCHESS\nDo not speak,\nFor there are times when all existences\nSeem narrowed to one single ecstasy,\nAnd Passion sets a seal upon the lips.\n\nGUIDO\nOh, with mine own lips let me break that seal!\nYou love me, Beatrice?\n\nDUCHESS\nAy! is it not strange\nI should so love mine enemy?\n\nGUIDO\nWho is he?\n\nDUCHESS\nWhy, you: that with your shaft did pierce my heart!\nPoor heart, that lived its little lonely life\nUntil it met your arrow.\n\nGUIDO\nAh, dear love,\nI am so wounded by that bolt myself\nThat with untended wounds I lie a-dying,\nUnless you cure me, dear Physician.\n\nDUCHESS\nI would not have you cured; for I am sick\nWith the same malady.\n\nGUIDO\nOh, how I love you!\nSee, I must steal the cuckoo\u2019s voice, and tell\nThe one tale over.\n\nDUCHESS\nTell no other tale!\nFor, if that is the little cuckoo\u2019s song,\nThe nightingale is hoarse, and the loud lark\nHas lost its music.\n\nGUIDO\nKiss me, Beatrice!\n[She takes his face in her hands and bends down and kisses him; a loud knocking then comes at the door, and GUIDO leaps up; enter a Servant.]\n\nSERVANT\nA package for you, sir.\n\nGUIDO\n[carelessly] Ah! give it to me.  [Servant hands package wrapped in vermilion silk, and exit; as GUIDO is about to open it the DUCHESS comes up behind, and in sport takes it from him.]\n\nDUCHESS\n[laughing]\nNow I will wager it is from some girl\nWho would have you wear her favour; I am so jealous\nI will not give up the least part in you,\nBut like a miser keep you to myself,\nAnd spoil you perhaps in keeping.\n\nGUIDO\nIt is nothing.\n\nDUCHESS\nNay, it is from some girl.\n\nGUIDO\nYou know \u2019tis not.\n\nDUCHESS\n[turns her back and opens it]\nNow, traitor, tell me what does this sign mean,\nA dagger with two leopards wrought in steel?\n\nGUIDO\n[taking it from her] O God!\n\nDUCHESS\nI\u2019ll from the window look, and try\nIf I can\u2019t see the porter\u2019s livery\nWho left it at the gate! I will not rest\nTill I have learned your secret.\n[Runs laughing into the corridor.]\n\nGUIDO\nOh, horrible!\nHad I so soon forgot my father\u2019s death,\nDid I so soon let love into my heart,\nAnd must I banish love, and let in murder\nThat beats and clamours at the outer gate?\nAy, that I must! Have I not sworn an oath?\nYet not to-night; nay, it must be to-night.\nFarewell then all the joy and light of life,\nAll dear recorded memories, farewell,\nFarewell all love! Could I with bloody hands\nFondle and paddle with her innocent hands?\nCould I with lips fresh from this butchery\nPlay with her lips? Could I with murderous eyes\nLook in those violet eyes, whose purity\nWould strike men blind, and make each eyeball reel\nIn night perpetual? No, murder has set\nA barrier between us far too high\nFor us to kiss across it.\n\nDUCHESS\nGuido!\n\nGUIDO\nBeatrice,\nYou must forget that name, and banish me\nOut of your life for ever.\n\nDUCHESS\n[going towards him]\nO dear love!\n\nGUIDO\n[stepping back]\nThere lies a barrier between us two\nWe dare not pass.\n\nDUCHESS\nI dare do anything\nSo that you are beside me.\n\nGUIDO\nAh! There it is,\nI cannot be beside you, cannot breathe\nThe air you breathe; I cannot any more\nStand face to face with beauty, which unnerves\nMy shaking heart, and makes my desperate hand\nFail of its purpose. Let me go hence, I pray;\nForget you ever looked upon me.\n\nDUCHESS\nWhat!\nWith your hot kisses fresh upon my lips\nForget the vows of love you made to me?\n\nGUIDO\nI take them back.\n\nDUCHESS\nAlas, you cannot, Guido,\nFor they are part of nature now; the air\nIs tremulous with their music, and outside\nThe little birds sing sweeter for those vows.\n\nGUIDO\nThere lies a barrier between us now,\nWhich then I knew not, or I had forgot.\n\nDUCHESS\nThere is no barrier, Guido; why, I will go\nIn poor attire, and will follow you\nOver the world.\n\nGUIDO\n[wildly]\nThe world\u2019s not wide enough\nTo hold us two! Farewell, farewell for ever.\n\nDUCHESS\n[calm, and controlling her passion]\nWhy did you come into my life at all, then,\nOr in the desolate garden of my heart\nSow that white flower of love -?\n\nGUIDO\nO Beatrice!\n\nDUCHESS\nWhich now you would dig up, uproot, tear out,\nThough each small fibre doth so hold my heart\nThat if you break one, my heart breaks with it?\nWhy did you come into my life? Why open\nThe secret wells of love I had sealed up?\nWhy did you open them -?\n\nGUIDO\nO God!\n\nDUCHESS\n[clenching her hand]\nAnd let\nThe floodgates of my passion swell and burst\nTill, like the wave when rivers overflow\nThat sweeps the forest and the farm away,\nLove in the splendid avalanche of its might\nSwept my life with it? Must I drop by drop\nGather these waters back and seal them up?\nAlas! Each drop will be a tear, and so\nWill with its saltness make life very bitter.\n\nGUIDO\nI pray you speak no more, for I must go\nForth from your life and love, and make a way\nOn which you cannot follow.\n\nDUCHESS\nI have heard\nThat sailors dying of thirst upon a raft,\nPoor castaways upon a lonely sea,\nDream of green fields and pleasant water-courses,\nAnd then wake up with red thirst in their throats,\nAnd die more miserably because sleep\nHas cheated them: so they die cursing sleep\nFor having sent them dreams: I will not curse you\nThough I am cast away upon the sea\nWhich men call Desolation.\n\nGUIDO\nO God, God!\n\nDUCHESS\nBut you will stay: listen, I love you, Guido.\n[She waits a little.]\nIs echo dead, that when I say I love you\nThere is no answer?\n\nGUIDO\nEverything is dead,\nSave one thing only, which shall die to-night!\n\nDUCHESS\nIf you are going, touch me not, but go.\n[Exit GUIDO.]\nBarrier! Barrier!\nWhy did he say there was a barrier?\nThere is no barrier between us two.\nHe lied to me, and shall I for that reason\nLoathe what I love, and what I worshipped, hate?\nI think we women do not love like that.\nFor if I cut his image from my heart,\nMy heart would, like a bleeding pilgrim, follow\nThat image through the world, and call it back\nWith little cries of love.\n[Enter DUKE equipped for the chase, with falconers and hounds.]\n\nDUKE\nMadam, you keep us waiting;\nYou keep my dogs waiting.\n\nDUCHESS\nI will not ride to-day.\n\nDUKE\nHow now, what\u2019s this?\n\nDUCHESS\nMy Lord, I cannot go.\n\nDUKE\nWhat, pale face, do you dare to stand against me?\nWhy, I could set you on a sorry jade\nAnd lead you through the town, till the low rabble\nYou feed toss up their hats and mock at you.\n\nDUCHESS\nHave you no word of kindness ever for me?\n\nDUKE\nI hold you in the hollow of my hand\nAnd have no need on you to waste kind words.\n\nDUCHESS\nWell, I will go.\n\nDUKE\n[slapping his boot with his whip]\nNo, I have changed my mind,\nYou will stay here, and like a faithful wife\nWatch from the window for our coming back.\nWere it not dreadful if some accident\nBy chance should happen to your loving Lord?\nCome, gentlemen, my hounds begin to chafe,\nAnd I chafe too, having a patient wife.\nWhere is young Guido?\n\nMAFFIO\nMy liege, I have not seen him\nFor a full hour past.\n\nDUKE\nIt matters not,\nI dare say I shall see him soon enough.\nWell, Madam, you will sit at home and spin.\nI do protest, sirs, the domestic virtues\nAre often very beautiful in others.\n\n[Exit DUKE with his Court.]\n\nDUCHESS\nThe stars have fought against me, that is all,\nAnd thus to-night when my Lord lieth asleep,\nWill I fall upon my dagger, and so cease.\nMy heart is such a stone nothing can reach it\nExcept the dagger\u2019s edge: let it go there,\nTo find what name it carries: ay! to-night\nDeath will divorce the Duke; and yet to-night\nHe may die also, he is very old.\nWhy should he not die? Yesterday his hand\nShook with a palsy: men have died from palsy,\nAnd why not he? Are there not fevers also,\nAgues and chills, and other maladies\nMost incident to old age?\nNo, no, he will not die, he is too sinful;\nHonest men die before their proper time.\nGood men will die: men by whose side the Duke\nIn all the sick pollution of his life\nSeems like a leper: women and children die,\nBut the Duke will not die, he is too sinful.\nOh, can it be\nThere is some immortality in sin,\nWhich virtue has not? And does the wicked man\nDraw life from what to other men were death,\nLike poisonous plants that on corruption live?\nNo, no, I think God would not suffer that:\nYet the Duke will not die: he is too sinful.\nBut I will die alone, and on this night\nGrim Death shall be my bridegroom, and the tomb\nMy secret house of pleasure: well, what of that?\nThe world\u2019s a graveyard, and we each, like coffins,\nWithin us bear a skeleton.\n\n[Enter LORD MORANZONE all in black; he passes across the back of the stage looking anxiously about.]\n\nMORANZONE\nWhere is Guido?\nI cannot find him anywhere.\n\nDUCHESS\n[catches sight of him] O God!\n\u2019Twas thou who took my love away from me.\n\nMORANZONE\n[with a look of joy]\nWhat, has he left you?\n\nDUCHESS\nNay, you know he has.\nOh, give him back to me, give him back, I say,\nOr I will tear your body limb from limb,\nAnd to the common gibbet nail your head\nUntil the carrion crows have stripped it bare.\nBetter you had crossed a hungry lioness\nBefore you came between me and my love.\n[With more pathos.]\nNay, give him back, you know not how I love him.\nHere by this chair he knelt a half hour since;\n\u2019Twas there he stood, and there he looked at me;\nThis is the hand he kissed, and these the ears\nInto whose open portals he did pour\nA tale of love so musical that all\nThe birds stopped singing! Oh, give him back to me.\n\nMORANZONE\nHe does not love you, Madam.\n\nDUCHESS\nMay the plague\nWither the tongue that says so! Give him back.\n\nMORANZONE\nMadam, I tell you you will never see him,\nNeither to-night, nor any other night.\n\nDUCHESS\nWhat is your name?\n\nMORANZONE\nMy name? Revenge!\n[Exit.]\n\nDUCHESS\nRevenge!\nI think I never harmed a little child.\nWhat should Revenge do coming to my door?\nIt matters not, for Death is there already,\nWaiting with his dim torch to light my way.\n\u2019Tis true men hate thee, Death, and yet I think\nThou wilt be kinder to me than my lover,\nAnd so dispatch the messengers at once,\nHarry the lazy steeds of lingering day,\nAnd let the night, thy sister, come instead,\nAnd drape the world in mourning; let the owl,\nWho is thy minister, scream from his tower\nAnd wake the toad with hooting, and the bat,\nThat is the slave of dim Persephone,\nWheel through the sombre air on wandering wing!\nTear up the shrieking mandrakes from the earth\nAnd bid them make us music, and tell the mole\nTo dig deep down thy cold and narrow bed,\nFor I shall lie within thine arms to-night.\n\nEND OF ACT II.","song":"Are You Lonely For Me","year":1991},{"artist":"BeBe & CeCe Winans","lyrics":"Ah, ha\nI know a place\nAin't nobody

Blige","lyrics":"The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\n\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\n\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro.

And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.\n\n(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.)

Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7\/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all!

Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.\n\nO'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.\n\nDAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!\n\nBLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.\n\nLENEHAN What about mixed bathing?\n\n(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\n\nFATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.\n\nMRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!\n\nMOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!\n\nNOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom.

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut.

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve.

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements.

Remerciez!\n\nTHE PIANOLA\n\nBest, best of all,\nBaraabum!\n\n\nKITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!\n\n(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.\n\nZOE Yorkshire through and through.

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding.

She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.)

My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)","song":"You Remind Me (From \"Strictly Business\")","year":1992},{"artist":"En Vogue","lyrics":"[Intro: En Vogue + (Dawn Robinson)]\nShoo (Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo, ah)\nShoo (Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo)\nShoo (Oh, oh, oh)\nShoo (Hey)\n\n[Verse 1: Dawn Robinson + En Vogue]\nMany say that I'm too young\nTo let you know just where I'm coming from, yeah\nBut you will see, it's just a matter of time\nMy love will surely make you mine\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life\nEveryone seems so uptight\nBut nothin's wrong and it's alright with my man (My man)\nI like the way we carry on\nHis love will send me on and on, with my man\nPeople out there can understand\n\n[Chorus: En Vogue + (Dawn)]\nI'm giving him something he can feel\n(Ooh) To let him know this love is real (hey, oh, I'm...)\nGiving him something he can feel (All my lovin')\nTo let him know this love is real (Oh my love is real)\nThis love is real\n\n[Interlude: Dawn]\nSo much joy for us, it seems\nSo much hope for material things\nAre they only in my dreams?\n(Hey, hey, oh yeah)\nAnd that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you\nTo let you know that real dreams do come true\nYou tell me what does it mean\n(Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLivin' in a world of ghetto life\nEveryone is so uptight, hey\nNothin's wrong, it's alright, my man (My man)\nI like the way we carry on\nHis lovin' will send me on and on, with my man\nPeople out there can understand that\n\n[Chorus: En Vogue + (Dawn)]\nI'm giving him something he can feel\nTo let him know this love is real\n(That I'm giving love, giving giving love, yeah)\nGiving him something he can feel\n(Nah nah, nah nah, yeah yeah, talk to me)\nTo let him know this love is real\n(I gotta let him know that this love's strong, yeah)\nThis love is real\n\nGiving him something he can feel\n(Giving, I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving love)\nGiving him something he can feel\n(Giving, I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving love)\nGiving him something he can feel\n(Ooh, so sweet to me, so sweet to me, baby, yeah)\nGiving him something he can feel...","song":"Giving Him Something He Can Feel","year":1992},{"artist":"TLC","lyrics":"[T-Boz]\nNow you want my love, well that's alright\nWell it will be there for you, morning, noon and night\nBut you gotta be good, and do it right\nAin't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life\nWell you wanna be loved, huh, hey that's okay\nCause it falls in line right with my sexuality\nBut you gotta be down, a nigga gotta be true\nCause otherwise this B ain't got no time for you, oh\n\n[Refrain]\nBaby, baby, baby\nI got so much love in me\nOh baby, baby\nBaby, baby, baby\nCause if you gonna get me off\nYou got to love me deep\n\n[T-Boz]\nWell, you want my heart, and all my time\nBut it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind\nCause a girl like me, won't settle for less\nI require plenty conversation with my sex\n\n[Chilli]\nLong as you know, that I can have any man I want to baby\nThat's actual and factual, but still I choose you\nTo be with me, and work on it, so you better not flake it up\n\n[Refrain x2]\n\n[Chilli]\nBaby, long as you know, that I can have any man I want to\nBaby, that's actual and it's factual\nBut still, I choose you, to be with me\nAnd work on that, so you better not flake it up\n\n[T-Boz]\nWell, you want my heart, and all my time\nBut it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind\nCause a girl like me, I won't settle for less\nI require plenty conversation with my sex\n\n[Refrain x2]\n\n[Chilli]\nI can have any man that I want to\nTime and place that I choose to\nBut I'm thinking that I would rather be here with you, yea\nThat's actual and factual\nYou're the one I seem to run back to, just to get me off\nYou got to love me, got to love me, got to love me\n\n[Refrain x2]\n\nI said any man that I want to\nTime and place that I choose to\nBut I'm thinkin that I would rather be here with you yeah","song":"Baby-Baby-Baby","year":1992},{"artist":"Boyz II Men","lyrics":"Last updated: 10\/6\/2018, 5:16PM MST\nOctoberOctober 6Jesse Powell \u2014 Jesse Powell (1996)October 5girl in red \u2014 chapter 1 (2018)\nBlanca \u2014 Shattered (2018)\nLouGotCash (feat.

The smoothness and mature sophistication in her sound offered a lighter (and calmer) shading to the early waves of hip-hop soul and alternative-R&B that reigned supreme in the '90s.\n\nWell into the early aughts, Braxton would find herself pairing quiet storm vibes with hip-hop undertones.\n\nAfter an unfortunate dip in mainstream appeal maligned by label issues and personal matters in the mid-00\u2019s (although that period would bring notable deep cuts and plenty more \u201cwhat could have beens\u201d), Braxton regained her place in the spotlight with a Dancing With The Stars stint, a successful reality TV show alongside her sisters, and a critically-acclaimed reunion album with her mentor Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds.\n\nNow the legend prepares to release her ninth studio album, slated to be released next year, including her current single \u201cDeadwood.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the songstress' milestone birthday, Billboard ranks the 25 best Toni Braxton songs, including singles and deep cuts.\n\n#25. \"You Mean The World To Me\" (1993)\n\nAfter departing from her all-sisters quintet, The Braxtons, the eldest of the girl group embarked on a successful solo career.\n\n1993 saw the arrival of Toni Braxton, a self-titled debut that topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B Albums charts for multiple weeks. As the fourth lead single on the LP, \u201cYou Mean The World\u201d reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1994, thanks to the soulful swing of the hook dedicated to a cherished lover.\n\n#24. \"Why Should I Care\" (1996)\n\nFollowing up her debut with Secrets, Braxton reinvigorated the sound and format of quiet storm with arguably her best album to date.\n\nFull of ballads centered on dealing with an unfaithful soulmate, Secrets cemented the legacy of Braxton\u2019s signature blend of mature-R&B with breezy adult contemporary. In this deep cut, the crooner questions why she should care about said partner over a psychedelic guitar riff and synth reminiscent of The Isley Brothers.\n\n#23. \"Spanish Guitar\" (2000)\n\nMost legends can\u2019t say that their international single became a soundtrack staple for a Brazilian soap opera. La\u00e7os de Fam\u00edlia would help Braxton\u2019s Latin pop ballad become a mass success in its home country -- and ultimately a primary example of Latin music\u2019s influence on mainstream culture.\n\n#22. \"The Heat\" (2000)\n\n\u201cSpanish Guitar\u201d aptly oozed a sweltering mystique fitting enough for Braxton\u2019s third studio album, The Heat. Also incorporating that magic is the album\u2019s title track, a subtle jaunt working in the sounds of a tropical summer and a light, jazzy groove. No wonder why the ending question is \u201cdoes anyone want some ice cream?\u201d\n\n#21. \"Hit The Freeway\" feat. Loon (2002)\n\nEntering the new millennium, Braxton gained more artistic control from LaFace. She also felt a need to strip away some of her balladry and embrace her love of hip-hop \u00e1 la Mariah Carey\u2019s Butterfly. Braxton\u2019s first LPs of the aughts -- The Heat and More Than A Woman -- also embraced a sexier, borderline controversial side of the songstress.\n\nAs the lone single from More Than A Woman, \u201cFreeway\u201d joins a list of notable bangers produced by Pharrell\u2019s launching pad, The Neptunes. And thanks to its Loon co-sign, it also has a Bad Boys Records stamp of approval.\n\n#20. \"Trippin' (That's The Way Love Works)\" (2005)\n\nAfter leaving LaFace Records in 2003, Braxton signed to the record label abyss known as Blackground Records. If you're familiar with the label\u2019s nightmare stories revolving around Aaliyah and JoJo, it goes without saying that Braxton\u2019s first (and only) album under the label, Libra, didn\u2019t fare well commercially.\n\nThat being said, the LP contains the singer\u2019s peak unreleased singles and barely-existent promos. The highlight of this particular cut: A comparison of spousal conflict with \u201c12 rounds up inside the [Madison Square] Garden.\u201d\n\n#19. \"Talking In His Sleep\" (1996)\n\n\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d asks the diva throughout the epicenter track of Secrets. Here, she\u2019s confronted by her adulterous lover who accidentally spills his dirty laundry while snoozing.\n\nAfflicted by a 70s noir-jazz riff, \u201cTalking\u201d takes a page from Madonna\u2019s \u201cJustify My Love,\u201d balancing a scandalous spoken word narrative with a seductive hook.\n\n#18. \"Yesterday\" feat. Trey Songz (2009)\n\nIt\u2019d take five years after Libra -- and a release from Blackground Records -- for Braxton to deliver her next studio album. Serving as the first single from Pulse, the singer gets over her ex (played by Trey Songz on deluxe versions) by labeling him a day of the past. \u201cYesterday\u201d served as a testament to how Braxton manages to maintain her signature blend of genre formats years after her higher charting moments.\n\n#17. \"Hurt You\" feat. Babyface (2014)\n\nWhen Braxton started her singing career in 1989, Babyface became an integral component of her artistry. After going through separate divorces, the duo partnered up for the Grammy-winning concept album Love, Marriage, and Divorce, featuring this apology ballad that topped the Adult R&B Songs chart.\n\n#16. \"Midnite\" (2005)\n\nThis cut from Libra perfectly captures Braxton\u2019s ability to cruise along with the stripped melodic structuring of her songs. Her ad-libs and riffs shine throughout \u201cMidnite,\u201d making it a pleasant earworm in her deeper catalogue.\n\n#15. \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" (1992)\n\nAlthough \u201cGive U My Heart\u201d -- a duet with Babyface -- is credited as Braxton\u2019s official single debut, \u201cLove\u201d receives the honor of her first solo effort. Both songs appeared on the Eddie Murphy rom-com Boomerang, but \u201cLove\u201d would be regarded as the favorite thanks to Braxton\u2019s powerhouse vocal control and dexterity.\n\n#14. \"How Many Ways\" (1993)\n\nReleased as a single in 1994, \u201cHow Many Ways\u201d adequately reflects the finalization of new jack swing and the emerging popularity of its brethren, hip-hop soul.\n\nThe soulful declaration -- co-written and produced by Tamar\u2019s future husband Vincent Hubert -- sees Braxton recounting various ways she loves her man. The single served opposite to its double-A side, the Whitney Houston-esque \u201cI Belong To You.\u201d\n\n#13. \u201cSeven Whole Days\u201d (1993)\n\nRegarded as one of Braxton\u2019s iconic singles, the songstress recalls not knowing her lover\u2019s whereabouts for more than a week.\n\nWritten and produced by her dream team of Babyface and Darryl Simmons, Braxton\u2019s runs are what impressed listeners the most. She would later revisit the song\u2019s idea, slyly mentioning \u201cgoing seven whole days without hearing from you,\u201d on \u201cFinally,\u201d Libra's semi-mash-up of her most famous lyrics.\n\n#12. \u201cJust Be A Man About It\u201d (2000)\n\nSince The Heat was meant to embrace the more progressive sounds of contemporary R&B, Braxton also incorporated a little electro-hop on the album\u2019s second single.\n\nWith the support of a stormy atmosphere and womanizing voicemail delivered by Dr. Dre, the singer\u2019s hurt vocals shine in yet another convincing performance.\n\n#11. \u201cThere\u2019s No Me Without You\u201d (1996)\n\nThis deep cut earnestly emotes despair and a feeling of defeat after a break-up.\n\nHelped by backing vocals of the songwriter, Babyface, this Toni Braxton song\u2019s hook glides with a country twang --  the singer adopting the vocal patterns of the genre with a pristine R&B palette.\n\n#10. \"Take This Ring\" (2005)\n\nImma let you finish Beyonc\u00e9, but Toni Braxton had one of the best \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d of all time.\n\nThree years before we\u2019d receive an official dance and a Spandex-driven anthem from Bey, Braxton released a club banger echoing a similar sentiment. Fortified by a rocking go-go beat -- produced by \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d and \u201c1 Thing\u201d hitmaker Rich Harrison -- this dose of playboy-repellent serves as a faint reminder of a music moment somewhat ahead of its time.\n\n#9. \"Sposed To Be\" (2005)\n\nOn Libra, \u201cTake This Ring\u201d was the upbeat single deserving more; \u201cSposed To Be\u201d was the slow jam that could have been more.\n\nA great candidate for quiet storm or lovemaking playlists, this deep cut radiates an intergalactic tranquility -- and infectious bridge -- highlighting the finesse of Braxton\u2019s later discography.\n\n#8. \"Hands Tied\" (2010)\n\nThe second single of Pulse came as another one of Braxton\u2019s sultrier career moments.\n\nWith an urgent vocal performance, the allure of \u201cHands Tied\u201d exists in its zephyrous keyboard chords. The song also provided a glimpse into the softer side of Warren \u201cOak\u201d Felder, who\u2019d go on to produce for Rihanna and Demi Lovato.\n\n#7. \"Another Sad Love Song\" (1993)\n\nFrom its opening \u201coh\u2019s\u201d and \u201cwoah\u2019s\u201d over a slinky melody, the first official single from Toni Braxton played on R&B\u2019s knack for providing radio with sad tunes.\n\nWith an addictive hook \u201cracking [people\u2019s] brains like crazy,\u201d the song reached No. 7 on the Hot 100 and earned a Grammy for \u201cBest R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\u201d\n\n#6. \"I Love Me Some Him\" (1996)\n\nIf R&B radio is unanimously consistent with playing one Toni Braxton single since its release, \u201cI Love Me Some Him\u201d would hold that title for sure.\n\nRegarded as one of her signatures, the song was released as a double-A side single to the R. Kelly-penned \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To.\u201d The best part exists at the end of this cosmopolitan ode -- Braxton\u2019s vocal harmonizing with the instrumental stealing the show.\n\n#5. \"Find Me A Man\" (1996)\n\nToday, Secrets remains without a skippable track. It also contains the singer\u2019s best deep cut.\n\nIn terms of essential Toni Braxton, \u201cFind Me A Man\u201d shows the singer\u2019s ability to draw listeners into her raw emotion over a cerebral melody. Here heartbreak reigns as the songstress finds herself tired of being alone, dreaming up the irresistible qualities of her Prince Charming.\n\n#4. \"Un-Break My Heart\" (1996)\n\nStanding as one of the greatest power ballads to ever exist, this Hot 100 chart-topper is the central song of Braxton\u2019s career. Vibrant in grandiose-theatrics and a heart-wrenching chorus in the midst of vocal acrobatics, \u201cUn-Break My Heart\u201d would sit at the summit for 11 weeks.\n\n#3. \"Breathe Again\" (1993)\n\nAs these Toni Braxton songs age, this single from her debut still finds its way on R&B rotation today. Sparkling in Sade-centric balladry and Diane Warren lyrics, the breathy chorus and stagnant verses displayed by Braxton execute the song\u2019s intended moodiness.\n\n\u201cBreathe Again\u201d would become a No. 3 hit and earn the singer\u2019s second Grammy win for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n#2. \"He Wasn\u2019t Man Enough For Me\" (2000)\n\nThe new millennium might have seen a new look and sound from the diva, but her anthemic spirit remained fervent. In the league of \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d and \u201cIndependent Women, Pt. 1,\u201d this song holds its own rightful spot.\n\nProduced by Rodney \u201cDarkchild\u201d Jerkins, this signature dance bop was blocked from the Hot 100\u2019s top spot by the stronghold of Carlos Santana and The Product G&B\u2019s \u201cMaria Maria.\u201d Today, it\u2019s revisited by those realizing a past flame couldn\u2019t handle it all.\n\n#1. \"Let It Flow\" (1996)\n\nPaired alongside \u201cYou\u2019re Makin\u2019 Me High,\u201d this double A-side single peaked at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Unlike its partnered uptempo jaunt, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d drifts like a slow-running stream guided by the presence of a hypnotizing guitar.\n\nStaying in line with the anthems Braxton has provided prior to and after \u201cLet It Flow,\u201d the song became a mainstay on radio, the Waiting To Exhale Soundtrack, and most importantly Braxton\u2019s performance catalogue.\n\nSimply put, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d could have been done by none other than the superstar herself -- particularly the mesmerizing ending.","song":"You're Makin' Me High\/Let It Flow","year":1996},{"artist":"R.

I do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more\nshrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than I do this day. A feeling has crept over me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. The task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. I know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. I trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. Should I seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me. The little experience I have had in addressing public meetings, in country schoolhouses, avails me nothing on the present occasion.\n\nThe papers and placards say, that I am to deliver a 4th [of] July oration. This certainly sounds large, and out of the common way, for it is true that I have often had the privilege to speak in this beautiful Hall, and to address many who now honor me with their presence. But neither their familiar faces, nor the perfect gage I think I have of Corinthian Hall, seems to free me from embarrassment.\n\nThe fact is, ladies and gentlemen, the distance between this platform and the slave plantation, from which I escaped, is considerable\u2014and the difficulties to be overcome in getting from the latter to the former, are by no means slight. That I am here to-day is, to me, a matter of astonishment as well as of gratitude. You will not, therefore, be surprised, if in what I have to say I evince no elaborate preparation, nor grace my speech with any high sounding exordium. With little experience and with less learning, I have been able to throw my thoughts hastily and imperfectly together; and trusting to your patient and generous indulgence, I will proceed to lay them before you.\n\nThis, for the purpose of this celebration, is the 4th of July. It is the birthday of your National Independence, and of your political freedom. This, to you, is what the Passover was to the emancipated people of God. It carries your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance; and to the signs, and to the wonders, associated with that act, and that day. This celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the Republic of America is now 76 years old. I am glad, fellow-citizens, that your nation is so young. Seventy-six years, though a good old age for a man, is but a mere speck in the life of a nation. Three score years and ten is the allotted time for individual men; but nations number their years by thousands. According to this fact, you are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. I repeat, I am glad this is so. There is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon. The eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times; but his heart may well beat lighter at the thought that America is young, and that she is still in the impressible stage of her existence. May he not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? Were the nation older, the patriot\u2019s heart might be sadder, and the reformer\u2019s brow heavier. Its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. There is consolation in the thought that America is young. Great streams are not easily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages. They may sometimes rise in quiet and stately majesty, and inundate the land, refreshing and fertilizing the earth with their mysterious properties. They may also rise in wrath and fury, and bear away, on their angry waves, the accumulated wealth of years of toil and hardship. They, however, gradually flow back to the same old channel, and flow on as serenely as ever. But, while the river may not be turned aside, it may dry up, and leave nothing behind but the withered branch, and the unsightly rock, to howl in the abyss-sweeping wind, the sad tale of departed glory. As with rivers so with nations.\n\nFellow-citizens, I shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. The simple story of it is that, 76 years ago, the people of this country were British subjects. The style and title of your \u201csovereign people\u201d (in which you now glory) was not then born. You were under the British Crown. Your fathers esteemed the English Government as the home government; and England as the fatherland. This home government, you know, although a considerable distance from your home, did, in the exercise of its parental prerogatives, impose upon its colonial children, such restraints, burdens and limitations, as, in its mature judgment, it deemed wise, right and proper.\n\nBut, your fathers, who had not adopted the fashionable idea of this day, of the infallibility of government, and the absolute character of its acts, presumed to differ from the home government in respect to the wisdom and the justice of some of those burdens and restraints. They went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the measures of government unjust, unreasonable, and oppressive, and altogether such as ought not to be quietly submitted to. I scarcely need say, fellow-citizens, that my opinion of those measures fully accords with that of your fathers. Such a declaration of agreement on my part would not be worth much to anybody. It would, certainly, prove nothing, as to what part I might have taken, had I lived during the great controversy of 1776. To say now that America was right, and England wrong, is exceedingly easy. Everybody can say it; the dastard, not less than the noble brave, can flippantly discant on the tyranny of England towards the American Colonies. It is fashionable to do so; but there was a time when to pronounce against England, and in favor of the cause of the colonies, tried men\u2019s souls. They who did so were accounted in their day, plotters of mischief, agitators and rebels, dangerous men. To side with the right, against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day. The cause of liberty may be stabbed by the men who glory in the deeds of your fathers. But, to proceed.\n\nFeeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. They petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. Their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. This, however, did not answer the purpose. They saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. Yet they persevered. They were not the men to look back.\n\nAs the sheet anchor takes a firmer hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger, as it breasted the chilling blasts of kingly displeasure. The greatest and best of British statesmen admitted its justice, and the loftiest eloquence of the British Senate came to its support. But, with that blindness which seems to be the unvarying characteristic of tyrants, since Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the Red Sea, the British Government persisted in the exactions complained of.\n\nThe madness of this course, we believe, is admitted now, even by England; but we fear the lesson is wholly lost on our present ruler.\n\nOppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. They felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. With brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. Just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! It was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. The timid and the prudent (as has been intimated) of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.\n\nSuch people lived then, had lived before, and will, probably, ever have a place on this planet; and their course, in respect to any great change, (no matter how great the good to be attained, or the wrong to be redressed by it), may be calculated with as much precision as can be the course of the stars. They hate all changes, but silver, gold and copper change! Of this sort of change they are always strongly in favor.\n\nThese people were called Tories in the days of your fathers; and the appellation, probably, conveyed the same idea that is meant by a more modern, though a somewhat less euphonious term, which we often find in our papers, applied to some of our old politicians.\n\nTheir opposition to the then dangerous thought was earnest and powerful; but, amid all their terror and affrighted vociferations against it, the alarming and revolutionary idea moved on, and the country with it.\n\nOn the 2d of July, 1776, the old Continental Congress, to the dismay of the lovers of ease, and the worshipers of property, clothed that dreadful idea with all the authority of national sanction. They did so in the form of a resolution; and as we seldom hit upon resolutions, drawn up in our day whose transparency is at all equal to this, it may refresh your minds and help my story if I read it. \u201cResolved, That these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be free and Independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, dissolved.\u201d\n\nCitizens, your fathers made good that resolution. They succeeded; and to-day you reap the fruits of their success. The freedom gained is yours; and you, therefore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. The 4th of July is the first great fact in your nation\u2019s history\u2014the very ring-bolt in the chain of your yet undeveloped destiny.\n\nPride and patriotism, not less than gratitude, prompt you to celebrate and to hold it in perpetual remembrance. I have said that the Declaration of Independence is the ring-bolt to the chain of your nation\u2019s destiny; so, indeed, I regard it. The principles contained in that instrument are saving principles. Stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.\n\nFrom the round top of your ship of state, dark and threatening clouds may be seen. Heavy billows, like mountains in the distance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! That bolt drawn, that chain broken, and all is lost. Cling to this day\u2014cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.\n\nThe coming into being of a nation, in any circumstances, is an interesting event. But, besides general considerations, there were peculiar circumstances which make the advent of this republic an event of special attractiveness.\n\nThe whole scene, as I look back to it, was simple, dignified and sublime.\n\nThe population of the country, at the time, stood at the insignificant number of three millions. The country was poor in the munitions of war. The population was weak and scattered, and the country a wilderness unsubdued. There were then no means of concert and combination, such as exist now. Neither steam nor lightning had then been reduced to order and discipline. From the Potomac to the Delaware was a journey of many days. Under these, and innumerable other disadvantages, your fathers declared for liberty and independence and triumphed.\n\nFellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men too\u2014great enough to give fame to a great age. It does not often happen to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. The point from which I am compelled to view them is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. They were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory.\n\nThey loved their country better than their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare virtue, and that when it is exhibited, it ought to command respect. He who will, intelligently, lay down his life for his country, is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise. Your fathers staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, on the cause of their country. In their admiration of liberty, they lost sight of all other interests.\n\nThey were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. They were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression. They showed forbearance; but that they knew its limits. They believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny. With them, nothing was \u201csettled\u201d that was not right. With them, justice, liberty and humanity were \u201cfinal;\u201d not slavery and oppression. You may well cherish the memory of such men. They were great in their day and generation. Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.\n\nHow circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! How unlike the politicians of an hour! Their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. They seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defense. Mark them!\n\nFully appreciating the hardship to be encountered, firmly believing in the right of their cause, honorably inviting the scrutiny of an on-looking world, reverently appealing to heaven to attest their sincerity, soundly comprehending the solemn responsibility they were about to assume, wisely measuring the terrible odds against them, your fathers, the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep the corner-stone of the national superstructure, which has risen and still rises in grandeur around you.\n\nOf this fundamental work, this day is the anniversary. Our eyes are met with demonstrations of joyous enthusiasm. Banners and pennants wave exultingly on the breeze. The din of business, too, is hushed. Even Mammon seems to have quitted his grasp on this day. The ear-piercing fife and the stirring drum unite their accents with the ascending peal of a thousand church bells. Prayers are made, hymns are sung, and sermons are preached in honor of this day; while the quick martial tramp of a great and multitudinous nation, echoed back by all the hills, valleys and mountains of a vast continent, bespeak the occasion one of thrilling and universal interest\u2014a nation\u2019s jubilee.\n\nFriends and citizens, I need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. Many of you understand them better than I do. You could instruct me in regard to them. That is a branch of knowledge in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker. The causes which led to the separation of the colonies from the British crown have never lacked for a tongue. They have all been taught in your common schools, narrated at your firesides, unfolded from your pulpits, and thundered from your legislative halls, and are as familiar to you as household words. They form the staple of your national poetry and eloquence.\n\nI remember, also, that, as a people, Americans are remarkably familiar with all facts which make in their own favor. This is esteemed by some as a national trait\u2014perhaps a national weakness. It is a fact, that whatever makes for the wealth or for the reputation of Americans, and can be had cheap! will be found by Americans. I shall not be charged with slandering Americans, if I say I think the American side of any question may be safely left in American hands.\n\nI leave, therefore, the great deeds of your fathers to other gentlemen whose claim to have been regularly descended will be less likely to be disputed than mine!\n\nMy business, if I have any here to-day, is with the present. The accepted time with God and his cause is the ever-living now.\nTrust no future, however pleasant,\nLet the dead past bury its dead;\nAct, act in the living present,\nHeart within, and God overhead.We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. To all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. But now is the time, the important time. Your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. You live and must die, and you must do your work. You have no right to enjoy a child\u2019s share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors. You have no right to wear out and waste the hard-earned fame of your fathers to cover your indolence. Sydney Smith tells us that men seldom eulogize the wisdom and virtues of their fathers, but to excuse some folly or wickedness of their own. This truth is not a doubtful one. There are illustrations of it near and remote, ancient and modern. It was fashionable, hundreds of years ago, for the children of Jacob to boast, we have \u201cAbraham to our father,\u201d when they had long lost Abraham\u2019s faith and spirit. That people contented themselves under the shadow of Abraham\u2019s great name, while they repudiated the deeds which made his name great. Need I remind you that a similar thing is being done all over this country to-day? Need I tell you that the Jews are not the only people who built the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepulchres of the righteous? Washington could not die till he had broken the chains of his slaves. Yet his monument is built up by the price of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men shout\u2014\u201dWe have Washington to our father.\u201d\u2014Alas! that it should be so; yet so it is.\nThe evil that men do, lives after them, The good is oft-interred with their bones.Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?\n\nWould to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold, that a nation\u2019s sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation\u2019s jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the \u201clame man leap as an hart.\u201d\n\nBut, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. \u2014The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, lowering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!\n\n\u201cBy the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord\u2019s song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.\u201d\n\nFellow-citizens; above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, \u201cmay my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\u201d To forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the world. My subject, then fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave\u2019s point of view. Standing, there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery\u2014the great sin and shame of America! \u201cI will not equivocate; I will not excuse;\u201d I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.\n\nBut I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia, which, if committed by a black man, (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. What is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual and responsible being? The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. When you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field, then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!\n\nFor the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race. Is it not astonishing that, while we are ploughing, planting and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California, capturing the whale in the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the Christian\u2019s God, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!\n\nWould you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for Republicans? Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood? How should I look to-day, in the presence of Americans, dividing, and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? speaking of it relatively, and positively, negatively, and affirmatively. To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your understanding.\u2014There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.\n\nWhat, am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to bum their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? No! I will not. I have better employments for my time and strength than such arguments would imply.\n\nWhat, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman, cannot be divine! Who can reason on such a proposition? They that can, may; I cannot. The time for such argument is passed.\n\nAt a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation\u2019s ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.\n\nWhat, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy\u2014a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.\n\nGo where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.\n\nTake the American slave-trade, which, we are told by the papers, is especially prosperous just now. Ex-Senator Benton tells us that the price of men was never higher than now. He mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. This trade is one of the peculiarities of American institutions. It is carried on in all the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every year, by dealers in this horrid traffic. In several states, this trade is a chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to the foreign slave-trade) \u201cthe internal slave trade.\u201d It is, probably, called so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave-trade is contemplated. That trade has long since been denounced by this government, as piracy. It has been denounced with burning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable traffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere, in this country, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave-trade, as a most inhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of God and of man. The duty to extirpate and destroy it, is admitted even by our DOCTORS OF DIVINITY. In order to put an end to it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren (nominally free) should leave this country, and establish themselves on the western coast of Africa! It is, however, a notable fact that, while so much execration is poured out by Americans upon those engaged in the foreign slave-trade, the men engaged in the slave-trade between the states pass without condemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.\n\nBehold the practical operation of this internal slave-trade, the American slave-trade, sustained by American politics and America religion. Here you will see men and women reared like swine for the market. You know what is a swine-drover? I will show you a man-drover. They inhabit all our Southern States. They perambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation, with droves of human stock. You will see one of these human flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children, from the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched people are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They are food for the cotton-field, and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad procession, as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them. Hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives! There, see the old man, with locks thinned and gray. Cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping, yes! weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn! The drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their strength; suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted with a scream, that seems to have torn its way to the center of your soul! The crack you heard, was the sound of the slave-whip; the scream you heard, was from the woman you saw with the babe. Her speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains! that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. Follow the drove to New Orleans. Attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of American slave-buyers. See this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. Tell me citizens, WHERE, under the sun, you can witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking. Yet this is but a glance at the American slave-trade, as it exists, at this moment, in the ruling part of the United States.\n\nI was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave-trade is a terrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of its horrors. I lived on Philpot Street, Fell\u2019s Point, Baltimore, and have watched from the wharves, the slave ships in the Basin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down the Chesapeake. There was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of Pratt Street, by Austin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town and county in Maryland, announcing their arrival, through the papers, and on flaming \u201chand-bills,\u201d headed CASH FOR NEGROES. These men were generally well dressed men, and very captivating in their manners. Ever ready to drink, to treat, and to gamble. The fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mother by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.\n\nThe flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, to the general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number have been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew to Mobile, or to New Orleans. From the slave prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of night; for since the antislavery agitation, a certain caution is observed.\n\nIn the deep still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by the dead heavy footsteps, and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door. The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I was often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. I was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.\n\nFellow-citizens, this murderous traffic is, to-day, in active operation in this boasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit, I see clouds of dust raised on the highways of the South; I see the bleeding footsteps; I hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave-markets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. There I see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice and rapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight.\nIs this the land your Fathers loved,\nThe freedom which they toiled to win?\nIs this the earth whereon they moved?\nAre these the graves they slumber in?But a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains to be presented. By an act of the American Congress, not yet two years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. By that act, Mason and Dixon\u2019s line has been obliterated; New York has become as Virginia; and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole United States. The power is co-extensive with the Star-Spangled Banner and American Christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter. Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the sportsman\u2019s gun. By that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person of every man are put in peril. Your broad republican domain is hunting ground for men. Not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime. Your lawmakers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this hellish sport. Your President, your Secretary of State, your lords, nobles, and ecclesiastics, enforce, as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country, and to your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not fewer than forty Americans have, within the past two years, been hunted down and, without a moment\u2019s warning, hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Some of these have had wives and children, dependent on them for bread; but of this, no account was made. The right of the hunter to his prey stands superior to the right of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of God included! For black men there are neither law, justice, humanity, not religion. The Fugitive Slave Law makes mercy to them a crime; and bribes the judge who tries them. An American judge gets ten dollars for every victim he con signs to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so. The oath of any two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony is nothing. He can bring no witnesses for himself. The minister of American justice is bound by the law to hear but one side; and that side, is the side of the oppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told. Let it be thundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king-hating, people-loving, democratic, Christian America, the seats of justice are filled with judges, who hold their offices under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man\u2019s liberty, hear only his accusers!\n\nIn glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of administering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless, and in diabolical intent, this Fugitive Slave Law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on the globe, having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. If any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, I will gladly confront him at any suitable time and place he may select.\n\nI take this law to be one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty, and, if the churches and ministers of our country were not stupidly blind, or most wickedly indifferent, they, too, would so regard it.\n\nAt the very moment that they are thanking God for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, and for the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, they are utterly silent in respect to a law which robs religion of its chief significance, and makes it utterly worthless to a world lying in wickedness. Did this law concern the \u201cmint, anise, and cumin\u201c\u2014abridge the fight to sing psalms, to partake of the sacrament, or to engage in any of the ceremonies of religion, it would be smitten by the thunder of a thousand pulpits. A general shout would go up from the church, demanding repeal, repeal, instant repeal!\u2014And it would go hard with that politician who presumed to solicit the votes of the people without inscribing this motto on his banner. Further, if this demand were not complied with, another Scotland would be added to the history of religious liberty, and the stern old Covenanters would be thrown into the shade. A John Knox would be seen at every church door, and heard from every pulpit, and Fillmore would have no more quarter than was shown by Knox, to the beautiful, but treacherous queen Mary of Scotland. The fact that the church of our country, (with fractional exceptions), does not esteem \u201cthe Fugitive Slave Law\u201d as a declaration of war against religious liberty, implies that that church regards religion simply as a form of worship, an empty ceremony, and not a vital principle, requiring active benevolence, justice, love and good will towards man. It esteems sacrifice above mercy; psalm-singing above right doing; solemn meetings above practical righteousness. A worship that can be conducted by persons who refuse to give shelter to the houseless, to give bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and who enjoin obedience to a law forbidding these acts of mercy, is a curse, not a blessing to mankind. The Bible addresses all such persons as \u201cscribes, Pharisees, hypocrites, who pay tithe of mint, anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith.\u201d\n\nBut the church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. It has made itself the bulwark of American slavery, and the shield of American slave-hunters. Many of its most eloquent Divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the Bible to the whole slave system. They have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of God; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for Christianity.\n\nFor my part, I would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those Divines! They convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Bolingbroke, put together, have done! These ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion. They strip the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. It is not that \u201cpure and undefiled religion\u201d which is from above, and which is \u201cfirst pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\u201d But a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes God a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man. All this we affirm to be true of the popular church, and the popular worship of our land and nation \u2013 a religion, a church, and a worship which, on the authority of inspired wisdom, we pronounce to be an abomination in the sight of God. In the language of Isaiah, the American church might be well addressed, \u201cBring no more vain ablations; incense is an abomination unto me: the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. They are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you. Yea! when ye make many prayers, I will not hear. YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF BLOOD; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge for the fatherless; plead for the widow.\u201d\n\nThe American church is guilty, when viewed in connection with what it is doing to uphold slavery; but it is superlatively guilty when viewed in connection with its ability to abolish slavery. The sin of which it is guilty is one of omission as well as of commission. Albert Barnes but uttered what the common sense of every man at all observant of the actual state of the case will receive as truth, when he declared that \u201cThere is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.\u201d\n\nLet the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds; and that they do not do this involves them in the most awful responsibility of which the mind can conceive.\n\nIn prosecuting the anti-slavery enterprise, we have been asked to spare the church, to spare the ministry; but how, we ask, could such a thing be done? We are met on the threshold of our efforts for the redemption of the slave, by the church and ministry of the country, in battle arrayed against us; and we are compelled to fight or flee. From what quarter, I beg to know, has proceeded a fire so deadly upon our ranks, during the last two years, as from the Northern pulpit? As the champions of oppressors, the chosen men of American theology have appeared\u2014men, honored for their so-called piety, and their real learning. The Lords of Buffalo, the Springs of New York, the Lathrops of Auburn, the Coxes and Spencers of Brooklyn, the Gannets and Sharps of Boston, the Deweys of Washington, and other great religious lights of the land have, in utter denial of the authority of Him by whom the professed to he called to the ministry, deliberately taught us, against the example or the Hebrews and against the remonstrance of the Apostles, they teach that we ought to obey man\u2019s law before the law of God.\n\nMy spirit wearies of such blasphemy; and how such men can be supported, as the \u201cstanding types and representatives of Jesus Christ,\u201d is a mystery which I leave others to penetrate. In speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States, of whom Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn, Samuel J. May of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend (Rev. R, R. Raymond) on the platform, are shining examples; and let me say further, that upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave\u2019s redemption from his chains.\n\nOne is struck with the difference between the attitude of the American church towards the anti-slavery movement, and that occupied by the churches in England towards a similar movement in that country. There, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, elevating, and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly, bound up the wounds of the West Indian slave, and restored him to his liberty. There, the question of emancipation was a high religious question. It was demanded, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living God. The Sharps, the Clarksons, the Wilberforces, the Buxtons, and Burchells and the Knibbs, were alike famous for their piety, and for their philanthropy. The anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement, for the reason that the church took its full share in prosecuting that movement: and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement, when the church of this country shall assume a favorable, instead or a hostile position towards that movement. Americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity, while the whole political power of the nation (as embodied in the two great political parties), is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. You hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of Russia and Austria, and pride yourselves on your Democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina. You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. You glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation\u2014a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. You shed tears over fallen Hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! You are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America. You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. You can bare your bosom to the storm of British artillery to throw off a threepenny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. You profess to believe \u201cthat, of one blood, God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,\u201d and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, (and glory in your hatred), all men whose skins are not colored like your own. You declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you \u201chold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;\u201d and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own Thomas Jefferson, \u201cis worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,\u201d a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.\n\nFellow-citizens! I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a by word to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union. It fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it, as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. Oh! be warned! be warned! a horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation\u2019s bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of God, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!\n\nBut it is answered in reply to all this, that precisely what I have now denounced is, in fact, guaranteed and sanctioned by the Constitution of the United States; that the right to hold and to hunt slaves is a part of that Constitution framed by the illustrious Fathers of this Republic.\n\nThen, I dare to affirm, notwithstanding all I have said before, your fathers stooped, basely stooped\nTo palter with us in a double sense:\nAnd keep the word of promise to the ear,\nBut break it to the heart.And instead of being the honest men I have before declared them to be, they were the veriest imposters that ever practiced on mankind. This is the inevitable conclusion, and from it there is no escape. But I differ from those who charge this baseness on the framers of the Constitution of the United States. It is a slander upon their memory, at least, so I believe. There is not time now to argue the constitutional question at length \u2013 nor have I the ability to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. The subject has been handled with masterly power by Lysander Spooner, Esq., by William Goodell, by Samuel E. Sewall, Esq., and last, though not least, by Gerritt Smith, Esq. These gentlemen have, as I think, fully and clearly vindicated the Constitution from any design to support slavery for an hour.\n\nFellow-citizens! there is no matter in respect to which, the people of the North have allowed themselves to be so ruinously imposed upon, as that of the pro-slavery character of the Constitution. In that instrument I hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but, interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT. Read its preamble, consider its purposes. Is slavery among them? Is it at the gateway? or is it in the temple? It is neither. While I do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the Constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it. What would be thought of an instrument, drawn up, legally drawn up, for the purpose of entitling the city of Rochester to a track of land, in which no mention of land was made? Now, there are certain rules of interpretation, for the proper understanding of all legal instruments. These rules are well established. They are plain, common-sense rules, such as you and I, and all of us, can understand and apply, without having passed years in the study of law. I scout the idea that the question of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of slavery is not a question for the people. I hold that every American citizen has a fight to form an opinion of the constitution, and to propagate that opinion, and to use all honorable means to make his opinion the prevailing one. Without this fight, the liberty of an American citizen would be as insecure as that of a Frenchman. Ex-Vice-President Dallas tells us that the Constitution is an object to which no American mind can be too attentive, and no American heart too devoted. He further says, the Constitution, in its words, is plain and intelligible, and is meant for the home-bred, unsophisticated understandings of our fellow-citizens. Senator Berrien tell us that the Constitution is the fundamental law, that which controls all others. The charter of our liberties, which every citizen has a personal interest in understanding thoroughly. The testimony of Senator Breese, Lewis Cass, and many others that might be named, who are everywhere esteemed as sound lawyers, so regard the constitution. I take it, therefore, that it is not presumption in a private citizen to form an opinion of that instrument.\n\nNow, take the Constitution according to its plain reading, and I defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it. On the other hand it will be found to contain principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.\n\nI have detained my audience entirely too long already. At some future period I will gladly avail myself of an opportunity to give this subject a full and fair discussion.\n\nAllow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work The downfall of slavery. \u201cThe arm of the Lord is not shortened,\u201d and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. Walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. It makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. From Boston to London is now a holiday excursion. Space is comparatively annihilated. Thoughts expressed on one side of the Atlantic are, distinctly heard on the other. The far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. The Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat of the Almighty, \u201cLet there be Light,\u201d has not yet spent its force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light. The iron shoe, and crippled foot of China must be seen, in contrast with nature. Africa must rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. \u201cEthiopia shall stretch out her hand unto God.\u201d In the fervent aspirations of William Lloyd Garrison, I say, and let every heart join in saying it:\nGod speed the year of jubilee\nThe wide world o\u2019er\nWhen from their galling chains set free,\nTh\u2019 oppress\u2019d shall vilely bend the knee,\n\nAnd wear the yoke of tyranny\nLike brutes no more.\nThat year will come, and freedom\u2019s reign,\nTo man his plundered fights again\nRestore.\n\nGod speed the day when human blood\nShall cease to flow!\nIn every clime be understood,\nThe claims of human brotherhood,\nAnd each return for evil, good,\nNot blow for blow;\nThat day will come all feuds to end.\nAnd change into a faithful friend\nEach foe.\n\nGod speed the hour, the glorious hour,\nWhen none on earth\nShall exercise a lordly power,\nNor in a tyrant\u2019s presence cower;\nBut all to manhood\u2019s stature tower,\nBy equal birth!\nThat hour will come, to each, to all,\nAnd from his prison-house, the thrall\nGo forth.\n\nUntil that year, day, hour, arrive,\nWith head, and heart, and hand I\u2019ll strive,\nTo break the rod, and rend the gyve,\nThe spoiler of his prey deprive\u2014\nSo witness Heaven!\nAnd never from my chosen post,\nWhate\u2019er the peril or the cost,\nBe driven.","song":"Independent Women Part I","year":2000},{"artist":"Destiny's Child","lyrics":"July 5, 1852\n\nMr. President, Friends and Fellow Citizens:\n\nHe who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than I have. I do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more\nshrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than I do this day. A feeling has crept over me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. The task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. I know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. I trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. Should I seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me. The little experience I have had in addressing public meetings, in country schoolhouses, avails me nothing on the present occasion.\n\nThe papers and placards say, that I am to deliver a 4th [of] July oration. This certainly sounds large, and out of the common way, for it is true that I have often had the privilege to speak in this beautiful Hall, and to address many who now honor me with their presence. But neither their familiar faces, nor the perfect gage I think I have of Corinthian Hall, seems to free me from embarrassment.\n\nThe fact is, ladies and gentlemen, the distance between this platform and the slave plantation, from which I escaped, is considerable\u2014and the difficulties to be overcome in getting from the latter to the former, are by no means slight. That I am here to-day is, to me, a matter of astonishment as well as of gratitude. You will not, therefore, be surprised, if in what I have to say I evince no elaborate preparation, nor grace my speech with any high sounding exordium. With little experience and with less learning, I have been able to throw my thoughts hastily and imperfectly together; and trusting to your patient and generous indulgence, I will proceed to lay them before you.\n\nThis, for the purpose of this celebration, is the 4th of July. It is the birthday of your National Independence, and of your political freedom. This, to you, is what the Passover was to the emancipated people of God. It carries your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance; and to the signs, and to the wonders, associated with that act, and that day. This celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the Republic of America is now 76 years old. I am glad, fellow-citizens, that your nation is so young. Seventy-six years, though a good old age for a man, is but a mere speck in the life of a nation. Three score years and ten is the allotted time for individual men; but nations number their years by thousands. According to this fact, you are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. I repeat, I am glad this is so. There is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon. The eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times; but his heart may well beat lighter at the thought that America is young, and that she is still in the impressible stage of her existence. May he not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? Were the nation older, the patriot\u2019s heart might be sadder, and the reformer\u2019s brow heavier. Its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. There is consolation in the thought that America is young. Great streams are not easily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages. They may sometimes rise in quiet and stately majesty, and inundate the land, refreshing and fertilizing the earth with their mysterious properties. They may also rise in wrath and fury, and bear away, on their angry waves, the accumulated wealth of years of toil and hardship. They, however, gradually flow back to the same old channel, and flow on as serenely as ever. But, while the river may not be turned aside, it may dry up, and leave nothing behind but the withered branch, and the unsightly rock, to howl in the abyss-sweeping wind, the sad tale of departed glory. As with rivers so with nations.\n\nFellow-citizens, I shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. The simple story of it is that, 76 years ago, the people of this country were British subjects. The style and title of your \u201csovereign people\u201d (in which you now glory) was not then born. You were under the British Crown. Your fathers esteemed the English Government as the home government; and England as the fatherland. This home government, you know, although a considerable distance from your home, did, in the exercise of its parental prerogatives, impose upon its colonial children, such restraints, burdens and limitations, as, in its mature judgment, it deemed wise, right and proper.\n\nBut, your fathers, who had not adopted the fashionable idea of this day, of the infallibility of government, and the absolute character of its acts, presumed to differ from the home government in respect to the wisdom and the justice of some of those burdens and restraints. They went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the measures of government unjust, unreasonable, and oppressive, and altogether such as ought not to be quietly submitted to. I scarcely need say, fellow-citizens, that my opinion of those measures fully accords with that of your fathers. Such a declaration of agreement on my part would not be worth much to anybody. It would, certainly, prove nothing, as to what part I might have taken, had I lived during the great controversy of 1776. To say now that America was right, and England wrong, is exceedingly easy. Everybody can say it; the dastard, not less than the noble brave, can flippantly discant on the tyranny of England towards the American Colonies. It is fashionable to do so; but there was a time when to pronounce against England, and in favor of the cause of the colonies, tried men\u2019s souls. They who did so were accounted in their day, plotters of mischief, agitators and rebels, dangerous men. To side with the right, against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day. The cause of liberty may be stabbed by the men who glory in the deeds of your fathers. But, to proceed.\n\nFeeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. They petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. Their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. This, however, did not answer the purpose. They saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. Yet they persevered. They were not the men to look back.\n\nAs the sheet anchor takes a firmer hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger, as it breasted the chilling blasts of kingly displeasure. The greatest and best of British statesmen admitted its justice, and the loftiest eloquence of the British Senate came to its support. But, with that blindness which seems to be the unvarying characteristic of tyrants, since Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the Red Sea, the British Government persisted in the exactions complained of.\n\nThe madness of this course, we believe, is admitted now, even by England; but we fear the lesson is wholly lost on our present ruler.\n\nOppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. They felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. With brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. Just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! It was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. The timid and the prudent (as has been intimated) of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.\n\nSuch people lived then, had lived before, and will, probably, ever have a place on this planet; and their course, in respect to any great change, (no matter how great the good to be attained, or the wrong to be redressed by it), may be calculated with as much precision as can be the course of the stars. They hate all changes, but silver, gold and copper change! Of this sort of change they are always strongly in favor.\n\nThese people were called Tories in the days of your fathers; and the appellation, probably, conveyed the same idea that is meant by a more modern, though a somewhat less euphonious term, which we often find in our papers, applied to some of our old politicians.\n\nTheir opposition to the then dangerous thought was earnest and powerful; but, amid all their terror and affrighted vociferations against it, the alarming and revolutionary idea moved on, and the country with it.\n\nOn the 2d of July, 1776, the old Continental Congress, to the dismay of the lovers of ease, and the worshipers of property, clothed that dreadful idea with all the authority of national sanction. They did so in the form of a resolution; and as we seldom hit upon resolutions, drawn up in our day whose transparency is at all equal to this, it may refresh your minds and help my story if I read it. \u201cResolved, That these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be free and Independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, dissolved.\u201d\n\nCitizens, your fathers made good that resolution. They succeeded; and to-day you reap the fruits of their success. The freedom gained is yours; and you, therefore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. The 4th of July is the first great fact in your nation\u2019s history\u2014the very ring-bolt in the chain of your yet undeveloped destiny.\n\nPride and patriotism, not less than gratitude, prompt you to celebrate and to hold it in perpetual remembrance. I have said that the Declaration of Independence is the ring-bolt to the chain of your nation\u2019s destiny; so, indeed, I regard it. The principles contained in that instrument are saving principles. Stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.\n\nFrom the round top of your ship of state, dark and threatening clouds may be seen. Heavy billows, like mountains in the distance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! That bolt drawn, that chain broken, and all is lost. Cling to this day\u2014cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.\n\nThe coming into being of a nation, in any circumstances, is an interesting event. But, besides general considerations, there were peculiar circumstances which make the advent of this republic an event of special attractiveness.\n\nThe whole scene, as I look back to it, was simple, dignified and sublime.\n\nThe population of the country, at the time, stood at the insignificant number of three millions. The country was poor in the munitions of war. The population was weak and scattered, and the country a wilderness unsubdued. There were then no means of concert and combination, such as exist now. Neither steam nor lightning had then been reduced to order and discipline. From the Potomac to the Delaware was a journey of many days. Under these, and innumerable other disadvantages, your fathers declared for liberty and independence and triumphed.\n\nFellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men too\u2014great enough to give fame to a great age. It does not often happen to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. The point from which I am compelled to view them is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. They were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory.\n\nThey loved their country better than their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare virtue, and that when it is exhibited, it ought to command respect. He who will, intelligently, lay down his life for his country, is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise. Your fathers staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, on the cause of their country. In their admiration of liberty, they lost sight of all other interests.\n\nThey were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. They were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression. They showed forbearance; but that they knew its limits. They believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny. With them, nothing was \u201csettled\u201d that was not right. With them, justice, liberty and humanity were \u201cfinal;\u201d not slavery and oppression. You may well cherish the memory of such men. They were great in their day and generation. Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.\n\nHow circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! How unlike the politicians of an hour! Their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. They seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defense. Mark them!\n\nFully appreciating the hardship to be encountered, firmly believing in the right of their cause, honorably inviting the scrutiny of an on-looking world, reverently appealing to heaven to attest their sincerity, soundly comprehending the solemn responsibility they were about to assume, wisely measuring the terrible odds against them, your fathers, the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep the corner-stone of the national superstructure, which has risen and still rises in grandeur around you.\n\nOf this fundamental work, this day is the anniversary. Our eyes are met with demonstrations of joyous enthusiasm. Banners and pennants wave exultingly on the breeze. The din of business, too, is hushed. Even Mammon seems to have quitted his grasp on this day. The ear-piercing fife and the stirring drum unite their accents with the ascending peal of a thousand church bells. Prayers are made, hymns are sung, and sermons are preached in honor of this day; while the quick martial tramp of a great and multitudinous nation, echoed back by all the hills, valleys and mountains of a vast continent, bespeak the occasion one of thrilling and universal interest\u2014a nation\u2019s jubilee.\n\nFriends and citizens, I need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. Many of you understand them better than I do. You could instruct me in regard to them. That is a branch of knowledge in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker. The causes which led to the separation of the colonies from the British crown have never lacked for a tongue. They have all been taught in your common schools, narrated at your firesides, unfolded from your pulpits, and thundered from your legislative halls, and are as familiar to you as household words. They form the staple of your national poetry and eloquence.\n\nI remember, also, that, as a people, Americans are remarkably familiar with all facts which make in their own favor. This is esteemed by some as a national trait\u2014perhaps a national weakness. It is a fact, that whatever makes for the wealth or for the reputation of Americans, and can be had cheap! will be found by Americans. I shall not be charged with slandering Americans, if I say I think the American side of any question may be safely left in American hands.\n\nI leave, therefore, the great deeds of your fathers to other gentlemen whose claim to have been regularly descended will be less likely to be disputed than mine!\n\nMy business, if I have any here to-day, is with the present. The accepted time with God and his cause is the ever-living now.\nTrust no future, however pleasant,\nLet the dead past bury its dead;\nAct, act in the living present,\nHeart within, and God overhead.We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. To all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. But now is the time, the important time. Your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. You live and must die, and you must do your work. You have no right to enjoy a child\u2019s share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors. You have no right to wear out and waste the hard-earned fame of your fathers to cover your indolence. Sydney Smith tells us that men seldom eulogize the wisdom and virtues of their fathers, but to excuse some folly or wickedness of their own. This truth is not a doubtful one. There are illustrations of it near and remote, ancient and modern. It was fashionable, hundreds of years ago, for the children of Jacob to boast, we have \u201cAbraham to our father,\u201d when they had long lost Abraham\u2019s faith and spirit. That people contented themselves under the shadow of Abraham\u2019s great name, while they repudiated the deeds which made his name great. Need I remind you that a similar thing is being done all over this country to-day? Need I tell you that the Jews are not the only people who built the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepulchres of the righteous? Washington could not die till he had broken the chains of his slaves. Yet his monument is built up by the price of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men shout\u2014\u201dWe have Washington to our father.\u201d\u2014Alas! that it should be so; yet so it is.\nThe evil that men do, lives after them, The good is oft-interred with their bones.Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?\n\nWould to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold, that a nation\u2019s sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation\u2019s jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the \u201clame man leap as an hart.\u201d\n\nBut, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. \u2014The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, lowering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!\n\n\u201cBy the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord\u2019s song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.\u201d\n\nFellow-citizens; above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, \u201cmay my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\u201d To forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the world. My subject, then fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave\u2019s point of view. Standing, there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery\u2014the great sin and shame of America! \u201cI will not equivocate; I will not excuse;\u201d I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.\n\nBut I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia, which, if committed by a black man, (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. What is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual and responsible being? The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. When you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field, then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!\n\nFor the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race. Is it not astonishing that, while we are ploughing, planting and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California, capturing the whale in the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the Christian\u2019s God, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!\n\nWould you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for Republicans? Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood? How should I look to-day, in the presence of Americans, dividing, and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? speaking of it relatively, and positively, negatively, and affirmatively. To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your understanding.\u2014There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.\n\nWhat, am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to bum their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? No! I will not. I have better employments for my time and strength than such arguments would imply.\n\nWhat, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman, cannot be divine! Who can reason on such a proposition? They that can, may; I cannot. The time for such argument is passed.\n\nAt a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation\u2019s ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.\n\nWhat, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy\u2014a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.\n\nGo where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.\n\nTake the American slave-trade, which, we are told by the papers, is especially prosperous just now. Ex-Senator Benton tells us that the price of men was never higher than now. He mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. This trade is one of the peculiarities of American institutions. It is carried on in all the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every year, by dealers in this horrid traffic. In several states, this trade is a chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to the foreign slave-trade) \u201cthe internal slave trade.\u201d It is, probably, called so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave-trade is contemplated. That trade has long since been denounced by this government, as piracy. It has been denounced with burning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable traffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere, in this country, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave-trade, as a most inhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of God and of man. The duty to extirpate and destroy it, is admitted even by our DOCTORS OF DIVINITY. In order to put an end to it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren (nominally free) should leave this country, and establish themselves on the western coast of Africa! It is, however, a notable fact that, while so much execration is poured out by Americans upon those engaged in the foreign slave-trade, the men engaged in the slave-trade between the states pass without condemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.\n\nBehold the practical operation of this internal slave-trade, the American slave-trade, sustained by American politics and America religion. Here you will see men and women reared like swine for the market. You know what is a swine-drover? I will show you a man-drover. They inhabit all our Southern States. They perambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation, with droves of human stock. You will see one of these human flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children, from the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched people are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They are food for the cotton-field, and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad procession, as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them. Hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives! There, see the old man, with locks thinned and gray. Cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping, yes! weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn! The drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their strength; suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted with a scream, that seems to have torn its way to the center of your soul! The crack you heard, was the sound of the slave-whip; the scream you heard, was from the woman you saw with the babe. Her speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains! that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. Follow the drove to New Orleans. Attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of American slave-buyers. See this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. Tell me citizens, WHERE, under the sun, you can witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking. Yet this is but a glance at the American slave-trade, as it exists, at this moment, in the ruling part of the United States.\n\nI was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave-trade is a terrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of its horrors. I lived on Philpot Street, Fell\u2019s Point, Baltimore, and have watched from the wharves, the slave ships in the Basin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down the Chesapeake. There was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of Pratt Street, by Austin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town and county in Maryland, announcing their arrival, through the papers, and on flaming \u201chand-bills,\u201d headed CASH FOR NEGROES. These men were generally well dressed men, and very captivating in their manners. Ever ready to drink, to treat, and to gamble. The fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mother by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.\n\nThe flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, to the general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number have been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew to Mobile, or to New Orleans. From the slave prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of night; for since the antislavery agitation, a certain caution is observed.\n\nIn the deep still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by the dead heavy footsteps, and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door. The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I was often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. I was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.\n\nFellow-citizens, this murderous traffic is, to-day, in active operation in this boasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit, I see clouds of dust raised on the highways of the South; I see the bleeding footsteps; I hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave-markets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. There I see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice and rapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight.\nIs this the land your Fathers loved,\nThe freedom which they toiled to win?\nIs this the earth whereon they moved?\nAre these the graves they slumber in?But a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains to be presented. By an act of the American Congress, not yet two years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. By that act, Mason and Dixon\u2019s line has been obliterated; New York has become as Virginia; and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole United States. The power is co-extensive with the Star-Spangled Banner and American Christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter. Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the sportsman\u2019s gun. By that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person of every man are put in peril. Your broad republican domain is hunting ground for men. Not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime. Your lawmakers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this hellish sport. Your President, your Secretary of State, your lords, nobles, and ecclesiastics, enforce, as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country, and to your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not fewer than forty Americans have, within the past two years, been hunted down and, without a moment\u2019s warning, hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Some of these have had wives and children, dependent on them for bread; but of this, no account was made. The right of the hunter to his prey stands superior to the right of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of God included! For black men there are neither law, justice, humanity, not religion. The Fugitive Slave Law makes mercy to them a crime; and bribes the judge who tries them. An American judge gets ten dollars for every victim he con signs to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so. The oath of any two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony is nothing. He can bring no witnesses for himself. The minister of American justice is bound by the law to hear but one side; and that side, is the side of the oppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told. Let it be thundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king-hating, people-loving, democratic, Christian America, the seats of justice are filled with judges, who hold their offices under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man\u2019s liberty, hear only his accusers!\n\nIn glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of administering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless, and in diabolical intent, this Fugitive Slave Law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on the globe, having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. If any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, I will gladly confront him at any suitable time and place he may select.\n\nI take this law to be one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty, and, if the churches and ministers of our country were not stupidly blind, or most wickedly indifferent, they, too, would so regard it.\n\nAt the very moment that they are thanking God for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, and for the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, they are utterly silent in respect to a law which robs religion of its chief significance, and makes it utterly worthless to a world lying in wickedness. Did this law concern the \u201cmint, anise, and cumin\u201c\u2014abridge the fight to sing psalms, to partake of the sacrament, or to engage in any of the ceremonies of religion, it would be smitten by the thunder of a thousand pulpits. A general shout would go up from the church, demanding repeal, repeal, instant repeal!\u2014And it would go hard with that politician who presumed to solicit the votes of the people without inscribing this motto on his banner. Further, if this demand were not complied with, another Scotland would be added to the history of religious liberty, and the stern old Covenanters would be thrown into the shade. A John Knox would be seen at every church door, and heard from every pulpit, and Fillmore would have no more quarter than was shown by Knox, to the beautiful, but treacherous queen Mary of Scotland. The fact that the church of our country, (with fractional exceptions), does not esteem \u201cthe Fugitive Slave Law\u201d as a declaration of war against religious liberty, implies that that church regards religion simply as a form of worship, an empty ceremony, and not a vital principle, requiring active benevolence, justice, love and good will towards man. It esteems sacrifice above mercy; psalm-singing above right doing; solemn meetings above practical righteousness. A worship that can be conducted by persons who refuse to give shelter to the houseless, to give bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and who enjoin obedience to a law forbidding these acts of mercy, is a curse, not a blessing to mankind. The Bible addresses all such persons as \u201cscribes, Pharisees, hypocrites, who pay tithe of mint, anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith.\u201d\n\nBut the church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. It has made itself the bulwark of American slavery, and the shield of American slave-hunters. Many of its most eloquent Divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the Bible to the whole slave system. They have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of God; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for Christianity.\n\nFor my part, I would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those Divines! They convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Bolingbroke, put together, have done! These ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion. They strip the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. It is not that \u201cpure and undefiled religion\u201d which is from above, and which is \u201cfirst pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\u201d But a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes God a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man. All this we affirm to be true of the popular church, and the popular worship of our land and nation \u2013 a religion, a church, and a worship which, on the authority of inspired wisdom, we pronounce to be an abomination in the sight of God. In the language of Isaiah, the American church might be well addressed, \u201cBring no more vain ablations; incense is an abomination unto me: the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. They are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you. Yea! when ye make many prayers, I will not hear. YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF BLOOD; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge for the fatherless; plead for the widow.\u201d\n\nThe American church is guilty, when viewed in connection with what it is doing to uphold slavery; but it is superlatively guilty when viewed in connection with its ability to abolish slavery. The sin of which it is guilty is one of omission as well as of commission. Albert Barnes but uttered what the common sense of every man at all observant of the actual state of the case will receive as truth, when he declared that \u201cThere is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.\u201d\n\nLet the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds; and that they do not do this involves them in the most awful responsibility of which the mind can conceive.\n\nIn prosecuting the anti-slavery enterprise, we have been asked to spare the church, to spare the ministry; but how, we ask, could such a thing be done? We are met on the threshold of our efforts for the redemption of the slave, by the church and ministry of the country, in battle arrayed against us; and we are compelled to fight or flee. From what quarter, I beg to know, has proceeded a fire so deadly upon our ranks, during the last two years, as from the Northern pulpit? As the champions of oppressors, the chosen men of American theology have appeared\u2014men, honored for their so-called piety, and their real learning. The Lords of Buffalo, the Springs of New York, the Lathrops of Auburn, the Coxes and Spencers of Brooklyn, the Gannets and Sharps of Boston, the Deweys of Washington, and other great religious lights of the land have, in utter denial of the authority of Him by whom the professed to he called to the ministry, deliberately taught us, against the example or the Hebrews and against the remonstrance of the Apostles, they teach that we ought to obey man\u2019s law before the law of God.\n\nMy spirit wearies of such blasphemy; and how such men can be supported, as the \u201cstanding types and representatives of Jesus Christ,\u201d is a mystery which I leave others to penetrate. In speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States, of whom Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn, Samuel J. May of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend (Rev. R, R. Raymond) on the platform, are shining examples; and let me say further, that upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave\u2019s redemption from his chains.\n\nOne is struck with the difference between the attitude of the American church towards the anti-slavery movement, and that occupied by the churches in England towards a similar movement in that country. There, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, elevating, and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly, bound up the wounds of the West Indian slave, and restored him to his liberty. There, the question of emancipation was a high religious question. It was demanded, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living God. The Sharps, the Clarksons, the Wilberforces, the Buxtons, and Burchells and the Knibbs, were alike famous for their piety, and for their philanthropy. The anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement, for the reason that the church took its full share in prosecuting that movement: and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement, when the church of this country shall assume a favorable, instead or a hostile position towards that movement. Americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity, while the whole political power of the nation (as embodied in the two great political parties), is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. You hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of Russia and Austria, and pride yourselves on your Democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina. You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. You glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation\u2014a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. You shed tears over fallen Hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! You are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America. You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. You can bare your bosom to the storm of British artillery to throw off a threepenny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. You profess to believe \u201cthat, of one blood, God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,\u201d and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, (and glory in your hatred), all men whose skins are not colored like your own. You declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you \u201chold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;\u201d and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own Thomas Jefferson, \u201cis worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,\u201d a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.\n\nFellow-citizens! I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a by word to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union. It fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it, as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. Oh! be warned! be warned! a horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation\u2019s bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of God, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!\n\nBut it is answered in reply to all this, that precisely what I have now denounced is, in fact, guaranteed and sanctioned by the Constitution of the United States; that the right to hold and to hunt slaves is a part of that Constitution framed by the illustrious Fathers of this Republic.\n\nThen, I dare to affirm, notwithstanding all I have said before, your fathers stooped, basely stooped\nTo palter with us in a double sense:\nAnd keep the word of promise to the ear,\nBut break it to the heart.And instead of being the honest men I have before declared them to be, they were the veriest imposters that ever practiced on mankind. This is the inevitable conclusion, and from it there is no escape. But I differ from those who charge this baseness on the framers of the Constitution of the United States. It is a slander upon their memory, at least, so I believe. There is not time now to argue the constitutional question at length \u2013 nor have I the ability to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. The subject has been handled with masterly power by Lysander Spooner, Esq., by William Goodell, by Samuel E. Sewall, Esq., and last, though not least, by Gerritt Smith, Esq. These gentlemen have, as I think, fully and clearly vindicated the Constitution from any design to support slavery for an hour.\n\nFellow-citizens! there is no matter in respect to which, the people of the North have allowed themselves to be so ruinously imposed upon, as that of the pro-slavery character of the Constitution. In that instrument I hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but, interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT. Read its preamble, consider its purposes. Is slavery among them? Is it at the gateway? or is it in the temple? It is neither. While I do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the Constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it. What would be thought of an instrument, drawn up, legally drawn up, for the purpose of entitling the city of Rochester to a track of land, in which no mention of land was made? Now, there are certain rules of interpretation, for the proper understanding of all legal instruments. These rules are well established. They are plain, common-sense rules, such as you and I, and all of us, can understand and apply, without having passed years in the study of law. I scout the idea that the question of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of slavery is not a question for the people. I hold that every American citizen has a fight to form an opinion of the constitution, and to propagate that opinion, and to use all honorable means to make his opinion the prevailing one. Without this fight, the liberty of an American citizen would be as insecure as that of a Frenchman. Ex-Vice-President Dallas tells us that the Constitution is an object to which no American mind can be too attentive, and no American heart too devoted. He further says, the Constitution, in its words, is plain and intelligible, and is meant for the home-bred, unsophisticated understandings of our fellow-citizens. Senator Berrien tell us that the Constitution is the fundamental law, that which controls all others. The charter of our liberties, which every citizen has a personal interest in understanding thoroughly. The testimony of Senator Breese, Lewis Cass, and many others that might be named, who are everywhere esteemed as sound lawyers, so regard the constitution. I take it, therefore, that it is not presumption in a private citizen to form an opinion of that instrument.\n\nNow, take the Constitution according to its plain reading, and I defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it. On the other hand it will be found to contain principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.\n\nI have detained my audience entirely too long already. At some future period I will gladly avail myself of an opportunity to give this subject a full and fair discussion.\n\nAllow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work The downfall of slavery. \u201cThe arm of the Lord is not shortened,\u201d and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. Walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. It makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. From Boston to London is now a holiday excursion. Space is comparatively annihilated. Thoughts expressed on one side of the Atlantic are, distinctly heard on the other. The far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. The Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat of the Almighty, \u201cLet there be Light,\u201d has not yet spent its force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light. The iron shoe, and crippled foot of China must be seen, in contrast with nature. Africa must rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. \u201cEthiopia shall stretch out her hand unto God.\u201d In the fervent aspirations of William Lloyd Garrison, I say, and let every heart join in saying it:\nGod speed the year of jubilee\nThe wide world o\u2019er\nWhen from their galling chains set free,\nTh\u2019 oppress\u2019d shall vilely bend the knee,\n\nAnd wear the yoke of tyranny\nLike brutes no more.\nThat year will come, and freedom\u2019s reign,\nTo man his plundered fights again\nRestore.\n\nGod speed the day when human blood\nShall cease to flow!\nIn every clime be understood,\nThe claims of human brotherhood,\nAnd each return for evil, good,\nNot blow for blow;\nThat day will come all feuds to end.\nAnd change into a faithful friend\nEach foe.\n\nGod speed the hour, the glorious hour,\nWhen none on earth\nShall exercise a lordly power,\nNor in a tyrant\u2019s presence cower;\nBut all to manhood\u2019s stature tower,\nBy equal birth!\nThat hour will come, to each, to all,\nAnd from his prison-house, the thrall\nGo forth.\n\nUntil that year, day, hour, arrive,\nWith head, and heart, and hand I\u2019ll strive,\nTo break the rod, and rend the gyve,\nThe spoiler of his prey deprive\u2014\nSo witness Heaven!\nAnd never from my chosen post,\nWhate\u2019er the peril or the cost,\nBe driven.","song":"Independent Women Part I","year":2001},{"artist":"JAY-Z","lyrics":"[Produced by The Neptunes]\n\n[Intro: Jay-Z]\nLet's go (Hov')\nUh-huh, Hov'\nYou, are, not, ready (Hov')\nUnstoppable (Dynasty)\nYoung Hova\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z]\nI'm a hustler baby (Hov', I'm a hustler)\nI just want you to know (Hov', I wanna let you know)\nIt ain't where I been (it ain't where I been, Hov')\nBut where I'm bout to go (top of the world!

Bad","year":2001},{"artist":"Ja Rule Featuring Ashanti","lyrics":"Hi, I\u2019m the Rap Critic. Let\u2019s talk about Ja Rule. Yeah\u2026 remember him?\n\nWell, if you do, you, you\u2019ll remember that he was one of the more successful 2Pac Knock-offs that tried to capatilize off of his likeness in the aftermath of his death, as made obvious by the bald head, red bandana, and perpetual shirtlessness, but whereas 2Pac\u2019s musical material, no matter how controversial or disagreeable, at least came across as genuine, intricate, insights of a man trying to sort out his world, Ja Rule\u2019s music came across as very\u2026 watered down, to say the least\n\nFirst of all, he sang WAY too much for a hardcore thug, as he kept claiming to be. Secondly, he sang WAY too much for someone who CAN\u2019T SING. *montage of Ja Rule singing* And Third, he had all of the mannerisms of 2Pac with absolutely none of the substance. And fourth, we already had a late 90\u2019s, eastcoast version of 2Pac. His name was DMX!\n\nAnd this is a comparison that must be noted, because not only did DMX arrive on the scene about a year before Ja Rule, but he also had an energy, griminess, and passion in his rhymes that made Ja Rule look like a corny knock off. X had diversity in his topics, ranging from hardcore anthems to tracks about multiple personalities to songs detailing his life like \u201cSlippin\u2019\u201d. His material was not only more clever and diverse, but also grittier, making you believe every word he viciously growled. That, coupled with the fact that, in 1998, both his first and second albums went number one in the same year, and you can bet your ass people were trying to imitate the formula. Not by trying to achieve the same intensity or ability as DMX, but by taking his exact aesthetic, and watering it down to hell\n\nNow, Ja and DMX were actually cool with each other at first, that is until right around the release of his second album, Rule 3:36, which is about the time Ja started going from run-of-the-mill gangsta rapper to employing one of the worst trends in HipHop: the \u201cthugs need love too\u201d songs. These were Ja Rule\u2019s Bread and FREAKING butter: songs with females on the chorus singing soulfully about how much they need Ja Rule and declaring their loving loyalty to him while he, in return, spits rhymes about hardcore sex and how much of a gangsta and playa he still is, despite his relationship with her. By the end of 2002, there was a never-ending torrent of \u201cI wanna be gangsta for the fellas and lovey-dovey for the ladies\u201d songs that dominated the airwaves for a while, the biggest single of which was \u201cAlways On Time\u201d, which is pretty much the first and last song from him that you really needed to hear when it comes to this topic. Everything that\u2019s done right and wrong is on this song, and mostly, it\u2019s done wrong, so let\u2019s check it out\n\n\"Always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), always on time\"\n\nRIGHT THERE! That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Smooth, R and B singer crooning about love for the girls, but we\u2019ve still gotta be hardcore, so I gotta talk about shooting guns!... Despite the fact that that has nothing to do with the mood she\u2019s trying to set. Like, in reality, this wouldn\u2019t work\n\n*singing* Yeah, boy, You know I love you! Tell me what you say to that! *pause* *guns go off* Holy shit! What the fuck!\n\n\u201cGave you my.... baby be mine\u201d\nWhat\u2026 what did you give him?\n\u201cAnd I gave you my all, now baby be mine\u201d\n\nOh\u2026 why was that edited out the first time? Did the first take have a\u2026 different word there?\n\n\u201cGave you my....\u201d *...you know\u2026 \u201cbaby be mine\u201d\n\nAlthough, the word she actually says here is \u201cI gave you my all\u201d, but then she says, \u201cNow baby, be mine\u201d. And, seeing that the context is, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t always answer my phone, but when you need me, I\u2019m there, giving you my \u201cALL\u201d and since, after giving him her \u201call\u201d, she still doesn\u2019t know whether or not he wants to be with her, I\u2019m going to forgo any thought that she\u2019s talking about spending quality time together as a loving couple and just assuming she\u2019s talking about her\u2026 you know\u2026\n\nBUT, it\u2019s just innocuously worded enough that someone could interpret it in a more innocent context, and that\u2019s a great way that R and B writing works: you can easily deduce a sexual or emotional context from what they\u2019re saying. However, when the verses are coming from a rapper who\u2019s still trying to be hardcore\u2026\n\n\u201cC'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover\nYou know, the one that swing dick like no other\u201d\n\nGoodbye, subtlety\u2026\n\n\"I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain\nBut baby you know the name and love is about pain\"\n\nYeah, I know I\u2019ve done very disrespectful things to you in the past, but, hey, you know who I am! I\u2019m a rich rapper! And besides, love is SUPPOSED to be about being hurt. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing things that hurt you! I\u2019m ONLY trying to verify the enduring power of our love!\n\n\"So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints\"\n\nYeah, so just sign these papers that will nullify your restraining order and\u2026 WHHA?!\n\n\"Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids\"\n\nI\u2019m sorry, did you mention something about a restraining order a little while ago?\n\n\"Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile\"\n\nI guess not! She had a freaking restraining order on you! Look, I understand that people get into relationship problems, but if it\u2019s come to the point of trying to legally restrict a person from being near you, we\u2019ve tread into some dangerous territory\n\n\"While I'm smackin you fast and hittin you all wild\"\n\nThat line about restraining orders is really ruining the rest of this song\n\n\"[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare,\"\n\nYes, most couples DON\u2019T have what we have between us, namely a document stating that we can\u2019t be within 100 feet of each other\n\n\"But who cares?\"\n\nThe court that drafted it?\n\n\u201cBaby, I\u2019m not always there when you call, but I\u2019m always on time\u201d\n\nAre you still singing this chorus? Why do you like this guy? He\u2019s obviously not worth your time!\n\n\u201cGirl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together\u201d\n\nSee, even Ja Rule wants you to get over him! He\u2019s done nothing to illustrate why he\u2019s not a good person! Like he said, get a grip!\n\nIt's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather\u201d\n\nOh wait, was he saying \u201cpull it together\u201d and \u201cget a grip\u201d because he wants her to overlook his shortcomings, because they\u2019ve \u201cbeen through worse\u201d, as he says? My bad, I guess. I thought he was having a moment of clarity, realizing he was a horrible person and telling her to move on from him. But what a foolish presumption, because most of these songs are about how \u201cgirl, you know that I\u2019m a bad boy, and you like the fact that I\u2019m a bad boy, and we\u2019re terrible for each other, but we just can\u2019t stay away from each other, because we love the fact that we\u2019re not supposed to be together *points finger in mouth* and blegh! You know, where Wale handled this topic with nuance and gave the proper weight to the subject, Ja Rule\u2019s songs exploit that angle, and that\u2019s what annoys me. The way this chorus is sung, it treats the topic with no gravity whatsoever, and tries to make the whole thing cute while Ja\u2019s lyrics in the verses outline just how stupid it really is\n\n\"Like the stormy nights you wrote a \"Dear Ja\" letter\nAnd took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather\"\n\nOkay, here\u2019s an instance where she did something pretty crappy to him, but I\u2019m fairly sure that she did this in response to something HE did\n\n\"Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B\nMoney Over Bitches\"\n\nYou know, like casually referring to her as a bitch, or living by the phrase \u201cM.O.B.\u201d, which means that he values money and material items over bitches, a derogatory term that he just called her, as in \u201cWhy did you cut up my car? Don\u2019t you remember? I value material items more than I value you! See, this is why things aren\u2019t working out! You don\u2019t understand me!\"\n\n\u201cI got two or three hoes for every V\u201d\n\nOr, you could look at the fact that he sees no shame in telling you that he has other girls\n\n\u201cAnd I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy\u201d\n\nAnd he keeps them high off of drugs to incapacitate them\u2026 like a pimp or\u2026 wait, is this song about a pimp and his relationship with a prostitute? Yeah, dude, I think it is! I mean, listen to that chorus again!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not always there when you call, but I\u2019m always on time\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something a prostitute would say to her pimp, \u201cyeah daddy, I may not always answer my phone, but I\u2019m always on time with my money!\u201d Dear God, why didn\u2019t I see it before!\n\n\"Believe me, this pimp game is very religious\"\n\nSeriously, why didn\u2019t I notice this? This is basically a song about how a pimp makes a girl feel special so that she\u2019ll sell her body for him, and Ashanti is the chick who\u2019s going for it! I mean, if that ISN\u2019T what this song is about, and Ja Rule writing a love song can be this easily misconstrued as a pimp-ho relationship, well, I guess that just shows how terrible he is at it\n\n\"I play hard, there's so many women I fathered\"\n\nWait, \u201cfathering\u201d someone means that you\u2019ve been a father to a person. So, you\u2019re bragging about the fact that you have a lot of daughters? I mean, contextually, this should be another line about how many women you\u2019ve had sex with, but if you\u2019re saying you \u201cfathered\u201d them, that verb specifically means to be a father to someone, so\u2026 unless raising multiple daughters was a thing that rappers bragged about in the early 2000\u2019s, this line is very wrongly worded\n\n\u201cOh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life\nCause you don't be comin home, sometimes\u201d\n\nHold on, so now, Ja Rule is the one concerned about her faithfulness? You just told us that you have two hoes for every car you own. As far as we know, you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s had sex with anyone else, so excuse me if I don\u2019t show sympathy to your speculations that probably arise from the fact that you\u2019re afraid your girlfriend might have the exact same morality code as you!\n\nAnd you could say that this is a lust song, that\u2019s it\u2019s not meant to be taken as a song about intimate relationships as much as sexual attraction, but then what\u2019s the excuse for cutesy lines like this:\n\n\"But we share something so rare\nBut who cares, you care\"\n\nDude, I know what this really is. This isn\u2019t a morally elusive song for the purpose of telling us a real story about two people struggling between lust and genuine attraction, this is a morally elusive song for the purpose of fooling girls into thinking he has a softer side to make them believe he\u2019ll treat them special, all the while flagging the \u201cbut I\u2019m a complicated thug\u201d card that\u2019s supposed to make it okay for him to have sex with other women because he \u201cjust doesn\u2019t want to be committed yet\u201d!\n\nIt\u2019s obvious, it\u2019s manipulative, and it\u2019s a perfect example of why I don\u2019t like these songs when they\u2019re done this way. And that\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t like Rap love songs in general, or that hardcore rappers shouldn\u2019t make love songs. It can be done right. Look at the quintessential \u201cthugs need love too\u201d song, \u201cAll I Need\u201d by Method Man\n\n\u201cBack when I was nothing You made a brother feel like he was somethin\nThat's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin\nEven when the skies were gray You would rub me on my back and say \"Baby it'll be okay\"\u201d\n\nThis is a great example of a rap love song that doesn\u2019t come across as either corny or pandering\n\n\"I'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck wit me\nBut you did, now I'm going all out kid And I got mad love to give,\"\n\nSure, to some people, this may not sound super romantic and sweet, but this brand of HipHop isn\u2019t about that: it\u2019s raw, it\u2019s reality, and it sounds authentic, and it doesn\u2019t need to be sugar-coated, which is what they did for \u201cAlways On Time\u201d, to cover up the fact that it\u2019s not about love, it\u2019s about manipulating women into thinking that Ja Rule gives a crap about you, and it barely bothers to hide it. Sorry, but I just hate the mood of this song. Ashanti here is desperately trying to get her to love him, begging him to be hers, and the only thing he does is talk about how awesome he is. It\u2019s annoyingly lop-sided in regards to who\u2019s giving them self to the other. I\u2019d give this song a 1 out of 5, because, you know, Ashanti was an okay singer\n\nI\u2019m the Rap Critic.

Let's talk about Ja Rule. Now, as previously stated in another episode, Ja Rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. Platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, Ja Rule had it all. But, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the \"thugs need love too\" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. Hit song after hit song, his \"pop gangster\" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this \"pop rapper\" for what he felt that he was: \"a studio thug\" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. That man was Mr. Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent. He'd call out Ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out Ja* Sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and Ja Rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of Ja Rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with\u2026 *\"In Da Club\" and \"21 Questions\"*\u2026 with club songs and love songs\u2026 Well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing \"21 Questions\", the love song I wanted to look at today\n\nWhen asked by Dr. Dre: \"How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?\"\n\n50 Cent responded with: I\u2019m two people. I\u2019ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that\u2019s not diversity, it\u2019s necessity\n\nAnd you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next\u2026 well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *clips of him performing Kanye's song, \"I Line Niggas'*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?\n\n*\"Rider, Part 2\"*\n\nOh yeah, yeah\u2026\n\nSo you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh\u2026 spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because\u2026 THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!\n\nBut i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a \"thugs need love too\" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out \"21 Questions\" by 50 cent, and see how it fares\n\n*intro*\n\nOh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?\n\n*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*\n\n*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money\n\n*police arrive*\n\nOh no, the cops! Maybe making all those songs in which I publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!\n\n*cops come in, song starts*\n\n*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*\n\n\"New York City! You are now riding\u2026 with 50 Cent!\n\nWell, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. I wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour\n\nYou gotta love it!\n\nPersonally, I think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever\n\nI just want to chill and twist the lye\nCatch stunts in my 745\n\nI just wanna let you know before this love song starts that I'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!\n\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\n\nAnd, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to Isaac Hayes, Mr. Nate Dogg on the hook\n\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\nAnd I gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of \"i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch\". Instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. He wants someone who's interested in more than money\u2026 despite what the intro may lead you to believe\n\nIf I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?\n\nAnd he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? It's straight up and to the point. And I wish he would have started with this instead of the \"riding in my car, smoking weed\" nonsense\n\nIf I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century\nCould I count on you to be there to support me mentally?\n\nYou know, for most \"thugs need love too\" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. And the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it\n\nIf I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?\n\nAlso, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about\n\nIf it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?\n\nOkay, that's kinda vague. You might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...\n\nI get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive\n\nOkay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. Got it\n\nI'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside\n\nYeah, he's asking questions about how you feel INSIDE, specifically about being an accomplice to murder\n\nNow would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?\n\nWould that be before or AFTER you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?\n\nAre you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?\n\nUh\u2026 does that count as one of the questions? Because now it sounds like you're trolling her. You mad I'm asking' you 21 questions? Yo mad, bruh?\n\nDo you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?\n\nNow THIS is a deep question, and the wording is important. Do you TRUST me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---\n\nI'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans\n\n\u2026and\u2026 and that was a bad transition. I don't even think that was a question, you just said, \"Baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of THAT apple bottom ASS\u2026 also, ya dreams, and shit...\n\nIf I was with some other chick and someone happened to see\n\nOkay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit I try to give this song. Listen to the whole thing\n\nIf I was with some other chick and someone happened to see\nAnd when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me\nWould you believe me or up and leave me?\nHow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\n\nYeah, this always got to me. He says, \"If someone saw me with another girl, NOT if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, IF IT WAS TRUE that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him.\" To be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. And what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on HER\n\nWould you believe me or up and leave me?\nHow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\n\nYes, 50 Cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly YOU who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!\n\nYeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. Not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids\n\nI love you like a fat kid loves cake\nYou know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile\n\nYeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling\n\nWe're only humans, girl, we make mistakes\nTo make it up, I'll do whatever it takes\nI love you lil a fat kid loves cake\n\nAnd THAT'S what makes this line bad to me: in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me\n\nOverall, though, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. Never underestimate the power of Nate Dogg's vocals, my friends. And in addition, 50 Cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable.

would rather be at home all by myself\nNot in this room\nWith people who don't even care about my well-being\nI don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend\nSo you can, go back, please enjoy your party\nI'll be here\nSomewhere in the corner\nUnder clouds of marijuana\nWith this boy who's hollering\nI can hardly hear\nOver this music I don't listen to\nAnd I don't wanna get with you\nSo tell my friends that I'll be over here\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nOh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nAnd I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here\n\n[Verse 2]\nExcuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this\nAn anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this\nAnd I know you mean only the best\nAnd your intentions aren't to bother me\nBut honestly I'd rather be\nSomewhere with my people\nWe can kick it and just listen to\nSome music with a message, like we usually do\nAnd we'll discuss our big dreams\nHow we plan to take over the planet\nSo pardon my manners\nI hope you'll understand that I'll be here\nNot there in the kitchen\nWith the girl who's always gossiping about her friends\nSo tell them I'll be here\nRight next to the boy who's throwin' up\nCause he can't take what's in his cup no more\nOh God why am I here?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nOh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh-oh-oh

it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this\nSo holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done\nI'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'\nAnd I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way\nSo tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready\nAnd I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low\nYo I'll be over here\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nOh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nAnd I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here","song":"Here","year":2016},{"artist":"Rihanna Featuring Drake","lyrics":"[Hook: Rihanna]\nArbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten\nEr sagte, ich muss\nArbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten\nEr sieht, wie ich mich\nSchmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig mache\nAlso stecke ich besser mehr\nArbeit, Arbeit, Arbeit, Arbeit, Arbeit, Arbeit rein\nWann wirst du es\nLernen, lernen, lernen, lernen, lernen?\nEs ist mir egal, wenn er\nLeid, leid, leid, leid, leidet\n\n[Verse 1: Rihanna]\nLangweilig! ...

cars behind\nAnd tell them hoes, \"Don't be so obvious!\"\nMona Lisa, long hair, don't care\nShe handle the business and don't ever tell\nShe bite the bullet and cough up the shells\nShe tell 'em, \"Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!\"\nAnd if he say yeah, then we meet him there\nShe feed him lies with his silverware\nShe don't want love, she just want her share\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nI know a bitch named Liz\nThis nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is\nSo he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears\nAnd then she tell me and I be all ears\nAnd then I go and tell my people and they already know him\nAnd then I call Liz and she say he comin' over\nI say, \"Good girl, just remember what I told ya\"\nShe gave me the salute, I say, \"Girl, you're a soldier\"\nWe're waitin' outside, watch him pull up\nWalk up to the door and right before he knock\nShe open the door naked, she left it unlocked\nThey started French kissin' so he didn't see moi\nAnd then she let him in, they stopped on the couch\nMusic up loud with his head in the clouds\nTurn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him\nPiss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown\nNigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around\nI ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down\nYou know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up\nLiz, that's enough, you can put your hands down\nAnd then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her\nShe a good actress and you a dead actor\nYou'll be dead after we get what we're after\nIf Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh\nI got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga\nBut think for me, nigga\nSend her to you like she ain't for me, nigga\nI hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga\nShe pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga\nShe slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga\nMona Lisa, I done painted the picture\nMo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas\nPussy got you out of character, nigga\nYou fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga\nTake everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion\nWe have your attention\nAnd now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga\nNow she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga\nWe just lookin' for the casserole, nigga\nBut she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (uh)\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nAh, every day she wake up with a different color makeup\nAnd a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall\nChillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter\nFour minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball\nPaparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh\nProbably on a Internet blog\nIn a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother\nMan, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow\nMona Lisa\nPussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls\nAnd he diggin' in it like he livin' in it\nMake a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God\nPoetry in a pear tree\nSweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him\nDid he want to make love in a yellow taxi\nNever gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat\nWoke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby\nThen he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie\nI'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing\nI'ma call up again like I did last week\nMake good with the friend and I'm all jazzy\nBritney with the twin and the girl Ashley\nFound out that I fucked, he was unhappy\nBitch, I never let the bullshit get past me\nBetter yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me\n'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting\nFucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone\nBut you sucked this dick, that's just nasty\nMatter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)\nYou fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)\nBitch, gimme your phone! (No!)\nLet me, let me take this call real quick\n(\u2026 lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?\nIs that the shit that you do?\nTouchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos\nJump on the internet, watchin' his interviews\nI don't know what the fuck lately got into you\nTell me who love you, I bet I love harder\nForgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?\nThe Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma\nDaycare after school and she never did charge her\nYou scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up\nYou know what, I give up, let me go get my gun\nI got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'\nGoddammit, you know that the damage is done\nBitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress\nI'm not supposed to go through this, I guess\nSo in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy\nI'm killin' myself\n\n[Outro: Lil Wayne & Kendrick Lamar]\nShe say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nOoh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nShe say, ooh, no emotion, Mona
