So ya best be duckin' fast
Yo T-Boz is ya being a boss
Chilli what's up wit' dat sauce?
Dis is it
Yo "T" step on that (shhh)

I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while it's hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge 2 be sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone

When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long

Been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes but all he
Tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down though
I might mess around it's only
'Cause I need some affection oh

So I creep yeah I
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention
Goes to show oh so I creep

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to rely
That you had a thang for me
Finest thang you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooo baby baby
It's on like that

I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Take a good look at it
Look at it now
Might the last time you'll
Have a go round
I'll let you touch it if you'd
Like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route

Don't go too fast
Don't go to slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive
And I like 'em in control

Baby it's yours
All yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours
All yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

I know that you want me, I can

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

You see I had this brother who was mad at me
Cuz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man (oh)
Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big
The sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work
If you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work
Cause if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin'
The girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin'
The girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it (oh)
Some of y'all be killin me
Thinkin' you got powers like Austin
But you're more like Mini-Me
And when you finally get your blood flowin'
It be lookin' like a pinky with a glove on it

To Sam:
Wish I'd told him how I felt, then maybe he'd be here right now, but
Instead

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closing more everyday
And I'm dyin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm cryin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say, the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down

I can say it so clearly, but you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had

Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust
or just who I let trust me, yeah

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before
then you're still down with me

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay

What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?

Well is it me or can it be
I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity
To what others must take as
a form of self-hate

And you want my love
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved (uh)
Hey that's okay
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nickel gotta be true
Cause otherwise this "B" ain't got no time for you
Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
Well you want my heart (uh)
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me (uh)
Won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex
Long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

(It's all about havin' a good time)
In your arms tonight yeah
(Just sit back and relax)
If you feel my body
(And try to imagine how I feel)
La la la la la la la la
(When we're together)
It will free your mind yeah

Listen
The sun is setting
But I still see the twinkle
In your eyes baby
The temperature's 80
Can you feel it feel it
Feel it feel it oh
I cannot be modest
When there's so much that's in store
And I've got it
And it's all for your body (huh)
You ready? (yeah)

Let's ride tonight
And forget what we've ever known
There are no promises
And nothin' is set in stone
So lets just take this moment slow
Cuz we don't know how long we gon' live so
Close your eyes and lets go

I just wanna have a good time

You didn't want me
Now I'm out the door

I'm so glad that we're not together
Cuz you're so sick
And I'm much better
Gave my world

Now I'm gone and you can't handle it
I've been givin' you the cold shoulder
Why can't you accept it's over

I do what I want to
When I want to
You gotta get over me
But why do you still want me
When I don't want you
You gotta get over me
All in my face

The 22nd of loneliness and we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'

Laying against the wall checking out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home

I never asked for this feeling

I was lost
I never asked for red roses

Somehow I let my emotions take hold
And guess what?
All at once
I'm in love

Oh
I miss you so much
I long for your love
It scares me
'Cuz my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?

Why did I act like you mattered?

You see I had this brother who was mad at me
'Coz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it

On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to rely
That you had a thang for me
Finest thang you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooo baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Diggin' on you

What'nt gone be nobody's fool

Either you bring it

Or you can't
Sometimes it gets kind of messy out there

Stuck on me at waffle house
After 1: 12, when I go out
Where do you hang?
Or do you slang?
Or wear a chain?
Wear platinum rings?
I still maintain my ghetto siren
Keep my pride
Get in my ride
Twenty-inch rims

And when my girls
Go to the mall
Around the world
And keep the change

We still remain so ooh

You don't know enough about this world to
Ever get it on with me
Or hang out where I do
You don't even look from across the floor
You don't have game enough any more
Come up on a girl like me
And that's not a possibility cause

You big plastic girl

I like old model cars and big sedans
You like two doors
Frontin' their clothes and Rolls
Or sit on the porch sip something real cold

I do suits while you prefer the lows
Tonight I'mma choose cause you already chose
Grown for the business and I run to flow

And do all the things only your best friend can
Only your best friends can

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I was like deep in a cool
Wasn't gone be nobody's fool

I just wanna have a good time (yeah, hmm)
(It's all about havin' a good time)
In your arms tonight yeah
(Just sit back and relax)
If you feel my body
(And try to imagine how I feel)
La la la la la la la la
(When we're together)
It will free your mind yeah

Listen
The sun is setting
But I still see the twinkle
In your eyes baby
The temperature's 80
Can you feel it feel it
Feel it feel it oh
I cannot be modest
When there's so much that's in store
And I've got it
And it's all for your body (huh)
You ready? (yeah)

Let's ride tonight
And forget what we've ever known
There are no promises
And nothin' is set in stone
So lets just take this moment slow
Cuz we don't know how long we gon' live so
Close your eyes and lets go

I just wanna have a good time

And when I ask you where you've been
You say out with your friends
I wanna believe you
But I can't stay with you (yeah)
For one more day hey hey

You didn't want me
Now I'm out the door
I'm happy
I'm so glad that we're not together
Cuz you're so sick
And I'm much better
Gave my world
I can't understand it
Now I'm gone and you can't handle it
I've been givin' you the cold shoulder
Why can't you accept it's over

I do what I want to
When I want to
You gotta get over me
But why do you still want me
When I don't want you
You gotta get over me
All in my face
Up in business

I'm free to do my own thing
So no more visits
You gotta get over me

Birds singin' sweet soundin' songs of love
That's so pretty girl
As we walk hand in hand
Just kickin' up sand
As the ocean laps at our feet ooh
I'm in your arms
And all of your charms are for me
Not for me

Check it
I need a crunk tight nigga
Makes seven figgas
Laced with a platinum
Not the silver shit nigga
And still seek her
Ten inch or bigga
Know how to lick it and stick it
Wha wha

Now don't get me wrong cuz I'm not a ho
But I know what I got you can't handle though
Cuz only real niggas wha
You don't know
So what you gon' do

What you gonna do with a bitch like me

And I know you want it
Come on let me kick a little game to you

Laying against the wall checking out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

You just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on

I go in and out again

I never asked for red roses

Somehow I let my emotions take hold
And guess what?
All at once
I'm in love

Oh
I miss you so much
I long for your love
It scares me
'Cuz my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?

Why did I act like you mattered?

A lonely mother gazining out of the window
staring at her son that she just can't touch
if at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
but all the praying just ain't helping at all
cuz he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
so he goes out and he makes his money
the best way he knows how
another body layin cold in the gutter
Listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers
and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it
your way or nothing at all
but I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession
for temptation but he just can't see
she gives him loving that his body
can't handle but all he can say
is "baby is good to me"
one day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
but he doesn't recognize his own face

What about your friends?
What about, what about?

Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust
or just who I let trust me, yeah

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before
then you're still down with me

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay

What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?

Well is it me or can it be
I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity
To what others must take as
a form of self-hate

Rap intro

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

Chorus:
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low

I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'

Take a good look at it look at it now
Might be the last time you'll have a go round
I'll let you touch it if you like to go down
I'll let you go further if you take this southern route

Don't go too fast don't go too slow you've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control
Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special all through the night

Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
Come through my door take off my clothes and turn on the red light
I know that you want me I can see it in your eyes
Ha-ha
You might as well be honest 'cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll

I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight
If I move too fast (too fast) just let me know
(Just let me know) 'Cause it means you move too slow

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I was like deep in a cool
Wasn't gone be nobody's fool

I've been watching
Come on let me kick a little game to you
Baby baby let me kick a little game with you

I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
Come on let me kick a little game to you

Laying against the wall checking out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

You just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on

And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty

Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

You see I had this brother who was mad at me
'Coz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it

Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand

My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm falling in love
There's one disadvantage

Rap intro

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

Chorus:
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low
...

1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3

Yo it's me Left Eye not about to settle for anybody wit'
A thang about me havin' to party
My life's havin' fun takin' a reason addin' season makin'
It he's in what is pleasin' 'cause yo I gots one
I am unordinary the more balls the merry
Not two hangin' hairy wit' dairy airy

'Cause to impress me is not to undress me
That's only unless we agree you down wit' OPP
And bein' honestly is what I want you to be
You wanna control me you need much authority
Understanding the depths of the '90's women
That is the way that I'm livin'

Das da way we like 'em
Das da way we like 'em
Das da way we like 'em
Das da way we like 'em

What up what up yo
The way that I like 'em or better
Yet let's talk about the way I dislike
The type that's always out to despite
Or what about the ones, the ones that's under your feet
Or like to wipe your butt before you're leavin' the dookey seat
But so take your time and you'll find
That it is true I like the ones that

Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust
or just who I let trust me, yeah

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before
then you're still down with me

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay

What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?

Yo, this is a story of a male female threat to society
You know being misjudged and not respected for what we are
But I want to send this special shout out to my girl tawana brawley
Cause no matter what we say or what we do
They'll always believe his story (ow)

Chorus:
His story (yeahee, yeahee, yeahee)
Hist story (ow)
They're gonna believe
His story
His story

Why does it have to be that we get labeled for what we do
It's hard enough for us to be ourselves without being used
Girls have an image too
But when they get mad at you
There is no telling what they'll say to hurt you

This is a story of a male female threat to society
Why you wanna go and tell a lie on me? (yeahee, yeah, oooh)

His story over mine his story will be his story
And my story is a waste of time (aaaah-aah-aah)
They're gonna believe

This is how it should be done
This is how it should be done comin' out of the black shade
Fightin' to lighten a path made back
Let's go way back to the beginnin'
That's when an idea took part from the start
Listen to another marley beat I'm impatient
I gotta leave my seat for motivation
Pump the bass what's next
Kickin' the steps me and the mirror's havin' wreck
So hard that I cracked my neck
And I'm poppin sweat now I'm soakin' wet
But I feeeel it
Grab the beat cause I must
Defeat it's a funky groove
So I steeeel it
To improve what could
Soon be the left eye move
Pin it down and snatch a sample to loop it up
And start makin' my own example cause

Guys they always wonder about me

There's no other way you can doubt me
Before I trust you I'll just be here alone
Can I tell ya, can I tell ya, can I tell ya?

Gosh Golly Dern so you still haven't learned
Well I'll be a damn fool
See 'cause it's headaches you've honestly earned me
You're jackin' da plan I'm like who are you man
Peter pan but it's still cool G
Slack off my back slip da hell out

To be on my back like that, to be on my back like that

The 22nd of loneliness and we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'

I'll let you go further if you take this southern route

Don't go too fast don't go too slow you've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control
Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special all through the night

Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
Come through my door take off my clothes and turn on the red light
I know that you want me I can see it in your eyes
Ha-ha
You might as well be honest 'cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll

I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight
If I move too fast (too fast) just let me know
(Just let me know) 'Cause it means you move too slow

On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby

Laying against the wall checking out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

You just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on

Got a scrub checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me

Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass

I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty

Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

There's one disadvantage

That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust
or just who I let trust me, yeah

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay

Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?

Yes it's me again
And I'm back
Oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

The 22nd of loneliness and we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'

Take a good look at it look at it now
Might be the last time you'll have a go round
I'll let you touch it if you like to go down
I'll let you go further if you take this southern route

Don't go too fast don't go too slow you've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control
Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special all through the night

Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
Come through my door take off my clothes and turn on the red light
I know that you want me I can see it in your eyes
Ha-ha
You might as well be honest 'cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll

I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight
If I move too fast (too fast) just let me know

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you

Baby baby ooh baby baby

I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so

You see I had this brother who was mad at me
'Coz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it

I know I'm kinda strange, to you sometimes
Don't always say, what's on my mind
You know that I've been hurt, by some guy
But I don't wanna mess up this time

And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
Cos I don't want to lose you
If you really really really care
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothing to you

My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm falling in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that I've been damaged

I might look through your stuff, for what I don't wanna find
Or I might just set you up, to see if you're all mine
I'm a little paranoid, from what I've been through

A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam
She'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping
At all 'cause he can't seem to keep
His self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that
You're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way
Or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little precious has a natural obsession

When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much see cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe

Rap intro
Being that i am the kinda girl that i am
nobody can make me do what i don't want to
i can be myself a lot and i'm proud of what i got
so i'll never change for you
Being that i am the kinda girl that i am
tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
i got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
do what pleases me
Yo left eye kick the scene
See everyday last week and not a place to go
this nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
but not this week i'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
he pulled up knock knock til i opened the door
peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
but yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go
hat 2 da back i gotta kick my pants down real low
that's the kinda girl i am

Thank you
I just wanna say thank you

Sittin' here thinkin' about everything
My momma told me
That I would always make it this far
I can't make sense of everything (everything)
But I know one thing
I gave it all of my heart
The road got lonely
Sometimes I was afraid
But luckily I had you
To ride the wave

Thank you for stayin' by my side
Hope you all enjoy the ride

Ride
Ride
With me
Come on
Let's go
Enjoy the ride
Ride
Ride
With me
I'ma take it way back
I'ma take it back down memory lane tonight

I remember just like it was yesterday (yesterday)
I was just dreamin'
Prayin' my whole life would change
You are the support you gave to me
You made me who I am today
Made me who I am today

Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'

Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

(appears as a bonus track on the red light special single)

Now I lay me down to sleep
That was then, but this is now
I pray the lord my soul to keep
I let you slip away somehow
If I should die before I wake
If I should die my pain shall stay
I pray the lord my soul to take
I made you what you are today

Now as I look at myself I'm seein' someone familiar
Starin' back at me through every deep crack that's in my mirror
And as I think to myself
I'm hearin somebody else scream at me (shhh...)
I no longer hear from
Could it be the unknown
Sneaking into my zone
Off we roam
My spirituals is not alone
I'm visualizing this invisible clone
It's my own and it's own
Rest assured it's my dome
Maybe I need to go to bed
Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head
Nots while I raps
When it hits me (ha ha ha ha...)
But now it's laughin at me
Yo what the hell is happenin'
Please somebody slap me
No way not another physical display
Somethin' must got me backin' off from way back in tha day
But what can it be
I can't recall the memories so if I may ask

I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday

Although for some apparent reason

Lights off, lights on

I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too

I used to walk around like
nothing could happen to me
life is a gamble so i
should live life more carefully
but all i know is that i
control my own destiny
i used to look at others
instead of me blaming me

don't ask yourself why
just look to the sky
believe that soon you'll see the other side

i know
that through all the struggle
there's a bright road
at the end of the tunnel
now you should know
whatever your dilemma may be

You'll learn
life is worth it
watch the tables turn

yeah yeah yeah yeah

whenever you feel troubled
with problems coming your way
don't ever get discouraged
there's always a better day
we all don't know the answers
...

I've been watching
Come on let me kick a little game to you
Baby baby let me kick a little game with you

I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
Come on let me kick a little game to you

Laying against the wall checking out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

You just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on

With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chicken head
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
Ain't gonna be the one in mini skirt
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooo ooo

I ain't never been no silly bitch
Waitin' to get rich
From a nigga bank account
I have always had my own things
Bought my own rings
Not gon' let you catch me out
You should take a lesson from me
I ain't the one to be

Rap intro

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

Chorus:
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low

A scrub is a guy that think he's fine
Is also known as a busta
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So

No
I don't want your number
No
I don't want to give you mine and
No
I don't want to meet you nowhere
No
Don't want none of your time and

No
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

Got a scrub checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass
So

I know I'm kinda strange, to you sometimes
Don't always say, what's on my mind
You know that I've been hurt, by some guy
But I don't wanna mess up this time

And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
Cos I don't want to lose you
If you really really really care
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothing to you

My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm falling in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that I've been damaged

I might look through your stuff, for what I don't wanna find
Or I might just set you up, to see if you're all mine
I'm a little paranoid, from what I've been through

When there's so much that's in store
And I've got it
And it's all for your body (huh)

Let's ride tonight
And forget what we've ever known
There are no promises
And nothin' is set in stone
So lets just take this moment slow
Cuz we don't know how long we gon' live so
Close your eyes and lets go

When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much see cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)

Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do

Don't want you to win that race

Goodbye goodbye

You sweet young thang you whatever you do
Lord knows you do it nice and easy you keep it nice and long
You sexy thang you whatever it is you want from me
You know I'll satisfy just keep the love at home

You know I treasure each and every waking moment

Please don't let our love turn out into a tragedy like it was for Juliet
Take me away into your arms...
It's all I ask of you

I say good night to both my Father and my Mother
I hope they'll be able to dream of one another
I think it's time for all the grown ups to go to bed

Enchanting caramel that carries sweet illusions
My crossing legs that bring on sexual confusion
How farther will I let you go on this sinful night?

Screams of pain to "take it easy! Won't you bite me gently?"
"Dont you dare forget that I'm not ready quite yet."
It's because of my mom that I've been acting sweetly and nice to you

All the things that I don't know, how they enchant me so
But isn't that normal, or at least how it should go
Show me all your feelings and I'll let you in my heart
Oh, if only you knew this from the start

I feel so in love just like Cinderella
And I will chase after you wearing only my glass shoes
I pray to God for time to come to a halt
Before the evil can come leaving us both at fault
Now, I have to escape just like Juliet did

Remember back in the time
When the only sign we had was pickets
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked
G-angs killin' others for colors
Thangs that we wear for fashion
Other brothers take it for a reason to be blastin'
What the kcuf is goin' on
Not soft like buttercups but had enough of singin' that same song
See, I stayed across the street from the projects
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk
To keep my pockets fat, like cellulite
Only been to jail one week for some shull-bit
And I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to

No, I shouldn't a did that, 'cause if I did that
Y'all would not hear that phat shit
That keeps you on your tippy-tippy-toes
Like that sellout, not callin' no names
But really, "who's bad"
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms
You can't forget where you come from

Take a good look in the mirror
And tell me, do you like what you see
Masters of deception, corruption and evil

The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes but all he
Tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down though
I might mess around it's only
'Cause I need some affection oh

So I creep yeah I
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention
Goes to show oh so I creep

Pssssttt
Hey Hey
Yeah it's me again
But uh on this one
I really really want you
To check me out
I have a little special thang goin' on
All y'all might not be able to get with this
But uh those who can (yeah)
You know what it is
Could guess who I be (yeah)
And she be just like me (uh huh)

Take a good look at it
Look at it now
Might be the last time you'll
Have a go round
I'll let you touch it if you'd
Like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route
Don't go too fast
Don't go too slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive
And I like 'em in control

(appears as a bonus track on the red light special single)

Now I lay me down to sleep
That was then, but this is now
I pray the lord my soul to keep
I let you slip away somehow
If I should die before I wake
If I should die my pain shall stay
I pray the lord my soul to take
I made you what you are today

Now as I look at myself I'm seein' someone familiar
Starin' back at me through every deep crack that's in my mirror
And as I think to myself
I'm hearin somebody else scream at me (shhh...)
I no longer hear from
Could it be the unknown
Sneaking into my zone
Off we roam
My spirituals is not alone
I'm visualizing this invisible clone
It's my own and it's own
Rest assured it's my dome
Maybe I need to go to bed
Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head
Nots while I raps
When it hits me (ha ha ha ha...)
But now it's laughin at me
Yo what the hell is happenin'
Please somebody slap me
No way not another physical display
Somethin' must got me backin' off from way back in tha day
But what can it be
I can't recall the memories so if I may ask

I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past

Ladies and gentlemen!
Yes my fine gentlemen friends
Okay, we're gonna turn to the chapter in eyenetics
Called left pimping
Everybody turn to left pimping
Now as you can see
It's located in a region near your man
Called untitled space

I'm t-boz I got it like that
Left eye's dope she's got it like that
Chilli's fly she's got it like that
Tlc and that's where it's at
I'm t-boz I got it like that
Left eye's dope she's got it like that
Chilli's fly she's got it like that
Tlc and that's where it's at

We met at the park at the summer jams
Tims untied with saggy pants
Not the kind of guy I would give a chance
But he was kinda packin' under circumstance
6 foot 3 sexy as can be
I saw him through the crowd comin' up to me
He said aren't you that shorty from tlc
He told me 'bout the things he would do to me

Bridge:
(so come on over)
Let me check you out
See just what you're talkin' 'bout
(so come on over)
Boy you turn me on
Talkin' that stuff on the telephone
(so come on over)
You got me showin' through
So I can't wait to get next to you

Don't let it take too long
I'm ready to put it on

You need some ginseng
For your ping ping
So we can do it!

You see I had this brother who was mad at me
'Coz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it

there's a bright road
at the end of the tunnel

Cuz you're so sick

Gave my world

Now I'm gone and you can't handle it
I've been givin' you the cold shoulder
Why can't you accept it's over

You gotta get over me
But why do you still want me

So no more visits

Rollin' to the club
Stop to get my grub on
Nothin' like those Krispy Kremes

Soon as I was done
It was time to get my groove on
Find a place that's happenin'
And I knew that it was on

From the moment
That I walked into the spot
It was bangin', it was swangin', oh
Till somethin' turned me off

I wasn't sure, coulda swore
I saw you with someone
And at much to my surprise, woah

You were right there
With your hands up in the air
You had hoochies everywhere, all on you
It's like I almost didn't know you

Tryin' to shake that ass
Playa, you don't even dance
Wassup wit' you
It's like I don't even know you

Left you at the crib
'Cause I know you get your game on
Happens every Tuesday night

You said that you was cool

And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
Cos I don't want to lose you
If you really really really care
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothing to you

My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm falling in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that I've been damaged

Or I might just set you up, to see if you're all mine

Please don't let our love turn out into a tragedy like it was for Juliet
Take me away into your arms...
It's all I ask of you

I say good night to both my Father and my Mother
I hope they'll be able to dream of one another
I think it's time for all the grown ups to go to bed

Enchanting caramel that carries sweet illusions
My crossing legs that bring on sexual confusion
How farther will I let you go on this sinful night?

Screams of pain to "take it easy! Won't you bite me gently?"
"Dont you dare forget that I'm not ready quite yet."
It's because of my mom that I've been acting sweetly and nice to you

All the things that I don't know, how they enchant me so
But isn't that normal, or at least how it should go
Show me all your feelings and I'll let you in my heart
Oh, if only you knew this from the start

I feel so in love just like Cinderella
And I will chase after you wearing only my glass shoes
I pray to God for time to come to a halt
Before the evil can come leaving us both at fault
Now, I have to escape just like Juliet did

About who and where I've been

About what time I came in
Tryna squeeze, baby please
Hit the road and don't come back
'Cause I can't trust a relationship
Wit no trust and that's a fact

If they act up just leave 'em alone

Don't take no mess from nobody

I won't answer to no one

Remember back in the time
When the only sign we had was pickets
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked
G-angs killin' others for colors
Thangs that we wear for fashion
Other brothers take it for a reason to be blastin'
What the kcuf is goin' on
Not soft like buttercups but had enough of singin' that same song
See, I stayed across the street from the projects
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk
To keep my pockets fat, like cellulite
Only been to jail one week for some shull-bit
And I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to

No, I shouldn't a did that, 'cause if I did that
Y'all would not hear that phat shit
That keeps you on your tippy-tippy-toes
Like that sellout, not callin' no names
But really, "who's bad"
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms
You can't forget where you come from

Take a good look in the mirror
And tell me, do you like what you see
Masters of deception, corruption and evil

And it's nothin' but a thing, to pick up where we left off (yeah)

Don't you ever think
Back on all that other shit we went through
You know I remember (yeah)
Don't you ever wish
One day we could reminisce
It feels like, we were just together
Cause we go way back

Like Prince and Marvin Gaye
Like South side on Sunday
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
Cause we go way back
James Brown and Michael J
Like them high school parties
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
We go way back

Twistin' up a twenty sack

But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate

Rap intro

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby

Wasn't gone be nobody's fool

Come on let me kick a little game to you
Baby baby let me kick a little game with you

I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
Come on let me kick a little game to you

Laying against the wall checking out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

You just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on

Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too

Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this

So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it

Well I'll be a damn fool
See 'cause it's headaches you've honestly earned me
You're jackin' da plan I'm like who are you man
Peter pan but it's still cool G
Slack off my back slip da hell out
My knee and yo correct dat effect
I'm not feelin dis G

I can depend on myself
I don't need anybody else
To be on my back like that, to be on my back like that

I can depend on myself
I don't need anybody else
To be on my back like that, to be on my back like that

Guys they always wonder what's with me
I never let them get in too close
I have my own control
I can't be bought or sold
And I never have to do what I'm told

(appears on the soundtrack a laface family christmas )

Tis the season to be givin'
And I've got somethin' just for you
Let's take a trip to my cabin
We can celebrate
A funky christmas made for 2 (oh)
That's all I want

Chorus:
All I want for christmas
Is to be loved by someone like you
Outside the snow is falling
My heart is calling
To spend my christmas time alone with you

Now throw a log on the fire
Then we could trim the tree
How much fun it would be

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to rely
That you had a thang for me
Finest thang you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooo baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I ain't never been no silly ho
Waitin' for your call
Like the other girls want you

With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chicken head
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
Ain't gonna be the one in mini skirt
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find

I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooo ooo

I ain't never been no silly bitch
Waitin' to get rich
From a nigga bank account

Bought my own rings

A scrub is a guy that think he's fine

Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So

No
I don't want your number

I don't want to give you mine and
No
I don't want to meet you nowhere
No
Don't want none of your time and

No

A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

Got a scrub checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass

Sunny days
Birds singin' sweet soundin' songs of love
That's so pretty girl
As we walk hand in hand
Just kickin' up sand
As the ocean laps at our feet ooh
I'm in your arms
And all of your charms are for me
Not for me

Check it
I need a crunk tight nigga
Makes seven figgas
Laced with a platinum
Not the silver shit nigga
And still seek her
Ten inch or bigga
Know how to lick it and stick it
Wha wha

Now don't get me wrong cuz I'm not a ho
But I know what I got you can't handle though
Cuz only real niggas wha
You don't know
So what you gon' do
What you gonna do
Wha wha wha

Chorus
Nigga you must be crazy
What you gonna do with a bitch like me
I'm so good at being bad
I'm the bitch you never had
I epitomize the word sexy
Nigga you must be crazy
What you gonna do with a bitch like me
Door knock so tight
Make ya cum all night
And you can't handle me

Chorus
I don't know what
She would do if she knew
That you were comin'
To do what we do
I don't know what
He would do if he knew
That you were comin'
To do what we do

Always wondered if she knew about us
When I met ya you said y'all had broke up
Right on time cuz I didn't have my love
Me and him was also messed up
That let me fall to you
And from what I could tell you fell too
And I wonder if it would be wrong
If we just kept it on
And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I never asked for this feeling
I never thought I would fall
I never knew how I felt till the day you were gone
I was lost
I never asked for red roses
I wasn't looking for love
Somehow I let my emotions take hold
And guess what?
All at once
I'm in love

Oh
I miss you so much
I long for your love
It scares me
'Cuz my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?

Why did I act like you mattered?

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty

Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

Same damn time every hurt or two
Something can happen to put me in your mood
Keep it inside till I turn dark blue
Trash everything I ever gave to you
Brought it on the front of your lexus coupe
Didn't want to leave you with a lame excuse
Sex so good turns love to abuse
When you wanna leave love's got you in a noose

It's not just when I'm in bed
Sometimes I'm so frustrated
I keep it all in my head
Till I just can't take it no more
It's not just when I get mad
Sometimes it's 'cuz I'm so glad
That you are near me now
I just have to get it out

Shout

You gotta let me get it out

You gotta let it go away

Don't wanna spend another day

Yea

Bring your love to me

Open all night

I can take you where you need to go
Take you there nice and slow
To a place where feelings run so deep
You just run to me

Fulfill your every wish

Dear lie
You suck
You said you could fix anything
Instead I'm fucked
You made things even worse for me
If I had balls I'd tell you get away from me
Guess I'm not smart
I let you unnerve me
I let you control me
Afraid the truth would hurt me
When it's you that hurts me more

Get outta my mouth
Get outta my head
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me

I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

I'll give you the red light special all through the night

Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
Come through my door take off my clothes and turn on the red light

Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
Well you want my heart (uh)
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind

Long as you know that I could have any man I want to

'Coz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this

So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it

It's nothing to you

My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm falling in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that I've been damaged

I might look through your stuff, for what I don't wanna find
Or I might just set you up, to see if you're all mine
I'm a little paranoid, from what I've been through

And I've got it
And it's all for your body (huh)

So lets just take this moment slow
Cuz we don't know how long we gon' live so
Close your eyes and lets go

Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame

You can fix your nose if you say so

Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty

Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn

And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't

Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?

But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

About the way a brother is hangin' too

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

And you want my love
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved (uh)
Hey that's okay
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nickel gotta be true
Cause otherwise this "B" ain't got no time for you
Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
Well you want my heart (uh)
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me (uh)
Won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex
Long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual

This is how it should be done
This is how it should be done comin' out of the black shade
Fightin' to lighten a path made back
Let's go way back to the beginnin'
That's when an idea took part from the start
Listen to another marley beat I'm impatient
I gotta leave my seat for motivation
Pump the bass what's next
Kickin' the steps me and the mirror's havin' wreck
So hard that I cracked my neck
And I'm poppin sweat now I'm soakin' wet
But I feeeel it
Grab the beat cause I must
Defeat it's a funky groove
So I steeeel it
To improve what could
Soon be the left eye move
Pin it down and snatch a sample to loop it up
And start makin' my own example cause

Chorus:
This is how it should be done
This is how it should be done (yeah, yeah)

Guys they always wonder about me
'Cause everything I have is my own
There's no other way you can doubt me
Before I trust you I'll just be here alone
Can I tell ya, can I tell ya, can I tell ya?

Gosh Golly Dern so you still haven't learned
Well I'll be a damn fool
See 'cause it's headaches you've honestly earned me
You're jackin' da plan I'm like who are you man
Peter pan but it's still cool G
Slack off my back slip da hell out
My knee and yo correct dat effect
I'm not feelin dis G

I can depend on myself
I don't need anybody else
To be on my back like that, to be on my back like that

I can depend on myself
I don't need anybody else
To be on my back like that, to be on my back like that

Guys they always wonder what's with me
I never let them get in too close
I have my own control
I can't be bought or sold
And I never have to do what I'm told

Yo mic check 1-2, 1-2

So ya best be duckin' fast
Yo T-Boz is ya being a boss
Chilli what's up wit' dat sauce?
dis is it
Yo "T" step on that(shhhhhh)

I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while its hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge 2 be sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone

When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own

What about your friends?
What about?
What about your friends?
What about, what about?

Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you

Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say I supply creativity
To what others must take as a form of self-hate

Rap intro

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

Chorus:
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low

The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many thangs
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me

I look him in his eyes but all he
Tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down though
I might mess around it's only
'Cause I need some affection, oh

So I creep, yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know

So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do

Take a good look at it
Look at it now
Might the last time you'll
Have a go round
I'll let you touch it if you'd
Like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route

Don't go too fast
Don't go to slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive
And I like 'em in control

Baby it's yours
All yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours
All yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

I know that you want me, I can

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooh baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I was like deep in a cool
Wasn't gone be nobody's fool

I've been watching
Come on let me kick a little game to you
Baby baby let me kick a little game with you

I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
Come on let me kick a little game to you

Laying against the wall checking out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

You just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on

I ain't never been no silly ho
Waitin' for your call
Like the other girls want you
I ain't never been no one to mess
With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chicken head
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
Ain't gonna be the one in mini skirt
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooo ooo

I ain't never been no silly bitch
Waitin' to get rich
From a nigga bank account
I have always had my own things
Bought my own rings
Not gon' let you catch me out
You should take a lesson from me
I ain't the one to be

A scrub is a guy that think he's fine and is
Also known as a buster (buster, buster)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So

No, I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
Don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

But a scrub is checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass
So (yeah, yeah)

No, I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too

You see I had this brother who was mad at me
'Coz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it

I know I'm kinda strange, to you sometimes
Don't always say, what's on my mind
You know that I've been hurt, by some guy
But I don't wanna mess up this time

And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
Cos I don't want to lose you
If you really really really care
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothing to you

My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm falling in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that I've been damaged

I might look through your stuff, for what I don't wanna find
Or I might just set you up, to see if you're all mine
I'm a little paranoid, from what I've been through

And forget what we've ever known

but all i know is that i

i used to look at others
instead of me blaming me

don't ask yourself why
just look to the sky
believe that soon you'll see the other side

i know
that through all the struggle
there's a bright road
at the end of the tunnel
now you should know
whatever your dilemma may be

You'll learn
life is worth it
watch the tables turn

with problems coming your way
don't ever get discouraged
there's always a better day
we all don't know the answers
