Woke up in the morning for work, ‘bout 5 or 6
Nothing seemed unusual, another day same
I never even gave one second thought about it
That this could be the one day that changed my life
Ohhhh…
(shoodoop)
It was like out of a movie, so unusual
This one particular girl, see, she passed my way
She was so damn beautiful, like she walked right out of the screen
Right then and there I knew I had to have her for my queen
(shoodoop)

So nice…

So nice…(the way she walked)…So right… So damn fine,
I just can't get you outta my mind

Girl you should know
play around with fire and you might get burned
you must be insane

Think that I'm a hoe
playin' me for easy, sleezy baby you should know
That ain't the way I roll.

Chorus:
Don't play dumb
when u know u want some
u ain't gonna get it
baby u know i ain't the one.

You were in a state of shock
Too hot
Blew up the spot
I knew I had to take you home tonight
I gotta admit it, I can't lie
You're so sexy, you're so fly
Changed a player into a family type of guy

Not a vowel on your face, no make up trace
Body like as fine one that's ready to taste
Personality so cool when you're at it to
I'm feeling you girl
You've got it going on

Jiggy, jiggy girl
You're the finest in the world
You're the kindest shorty I've ever seen
Jiggy, jiggy girl
You're a diamond and a pearl
No other lady compares to you

I can't deny, I was lost
When I looked into your eyes
Every move you make I start to fantasize
I see you hear me, I can see it girl
Slow rolling, no show, your love is so soft

[Cha Cha]
Uh, Cha Cha
You bet this broad get it all from a nigga
From the car to the figures
Even your tour money
Honey since last fall in December
I've been getting that
And setting that to the side
If I pinch that
It's only cause your royalty and pug checks ain't in yet
Why you wait so late to get pissed?
I just about done spent this
You know you wish you hit this
Some just know where to trickin'
But listen I know you wish you had to see
These broads ain't get you like I get you
They ain't as bad as me

[Profyle]
When I first met you girl I
I was a fool
Had a nigga trippin' thinking that I
Would get with you
Baby having you all to myself
Just wasn't like no one else
You tried to play me
But now I see you shady and I

[Profyle]
I got a feeling that you're
Too shady, just too shady
Baby I thought that you'd
Change your ways for me
I got a feeling that you're
Too shady, just too shady

I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start
Voices tearin' me apart
You keep on callin' me, whispers in the dark

You step in the room, close the door
Trail your clothes across the floor, you come to me
Fine as you wanna be, yeah

You slowly turn back the sheets
Slide your body on to me, so sexually
Girl, you don't miss a beat, no

Then when I touch you so sexy, I'll help you get off
I'll make you feel so good, you wanna cry
When I'm deep inside your love

And when you touch me so sexy, my love is like a rock
You say let's get down tonight
But then I awake, I hear whispers in the dark

I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start

Oh what can I say

You came and got things today
I packed your car, I watched you drive away
I cried so many tears that day
It burnt my face, it felt like acid rain
I know I can't keep lying to myself
I said I'd be content with someone else
I know I never have to face the pain, baby baby

I won't cry no more, I won't drown in my tears
I won't die no more, I've got over my fears
And I'm moving on, girl I know what to do
Cause I'm better off without you, and we both know that it's true

Well

Over time, I've building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams

Its been cold for a week
We don't talk
We don't speak
Turn away from each other when we lie in bed
I don't understand what's goin on in our head

How the pride
Makes us blind 
To the hurt
That we both know is killing us slowly inside
Why can't you and i decide?
Someway
Somehow
Right here
Right now

Verse 1: 
Baby baby since you've been away
The skies are gray, my world is fading
I see love is walkin' 'round my way
The holiday, the celebrating
With everyone with smiles upon their face
Anticipating
But the stars are not for me cause deep inside my heart is aching
When your out there on the road
I'm missing you, I can't hold on (I can't hold on)
And on this special day

Chorus:
Baby come home, baby come home
This Christmas night, (this Christmas night) don't leave me home alone
Don't leave me alone, baby come home (callin on you)
It's just not right, for you to leave me alone
Make sure you're home

I think it's time I let you know you can go

A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I wont let you back in my life
So I'm takin

Seven years I have lived this lie
When inside you made me cry
Through it all I still remained
