I been feeling kinda strange lately
I don't know what's going on, baby
Ever since I came back from out of town
Something's telling me some bullshit is going down

1 - Boy is it someone else you're seeking
Is it someone else
My vitals' telling me you're creeping
Finding numbers in your jeans
You're talking in your sleep
Faded letters written by me get o-u-t

2 - No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else
...

Ooh
Hey
Hey eh eh

It's been a while since I've heard from you
For so many nights I've contemplated
On what you're going through baby

It seems like everything is changin' now
'Cause we don't show love to each other
The way we used to

Please believe that I want to truly understand you
And if open up baby, I promise to try
Try to give what you need to show you that I'm willin'
To listen with my heart and let go of my pride

You're my lovely
You're my lovely
You're my baby
You're my lovely

Maybe I've been too possessive baby
I know that I've tried to control you
And rule your everything
(Your everything)

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I'm your girl, you're my man
And we stand hand and hand
When we're together
You know it
But when we are apart
It just breaks my poor heart
I need you forever
By my side

Baby I want you
And you want me
Can't stand the fact
That we can't be
Together constantly
I wanna be in your arms
Makin' love all night long
Ooh baby, ooh yeah
You got me thinkin' of you

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days
Without you right here, baby by my side
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night

There's no doubt, in my mind
If we both had the time
We'd spend it together
You know it
You and me, me and you
You know just what we'd do
All night

As I look back in time
Baby, I apologize

Baby, I apologize
I must have been blind
Now I need you by my side

As I look back in time
Baby, I apologize
I must have been blind
Now I need you by my side

Remember the sin
When I was young and so much fun
Playin' the games that we would play
I hurt you in a bad way

Never did I imagine that
I would yearn for your lovin' back
Back in my heart again
Back in my heart again
When I look back now

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories time after

Sometimes you picture me I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you said
And then you say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

All of my rhymes fall all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Killing late nights cruisin' all you see is the break lights
And hair blowing you know where we going
Or at the club in the rear frontin', poppin', droppin'
The amounts of cats but we ain't trying to hear nothing
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me
Hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy

Keep the ice out the club life change face
Get on love wife while he on the license plates
Wait make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down
Got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep me Jiggly all of my days

In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' about cha babe

Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smell the coffee

Why two women can't share one man

Hey, hey, yo is this thing on?
Oh, for a second there I thought that I was
Was the only one whose man put
His car before his girl,
Put his friends before the relationship,
But i guess these are the things we have to deal with huh?

Stood me up for the thousandth time (thousandth time)
Said he was runnin round
He was crazy busy at the studio.
I wanted to key his car, cut his his clothes,
I wanted him to die.
But then he stepped in for a second

Boy, I think that you should know
You could have all the doe
But you can't buy me, money can't buy me
You can have all the whips
You can have all the cribs
You can have all the chips
You can have all the hits
You have any girl you need
You can be living like a king
That don't mean anything you see
Cuz baby you ain't got me
Baby, I know you're not tryin' to tempt me
Gas me up on empty
When you know I peeped game right from the door
You're mistaking
To think that I'll go crazy
You may think that I'm hating
But I'm not the least bit infatuated

Yo, I'ma tell you 'bout them four letter words
Your momma used to tell you about, uh-huh
I'm not talkin' 'bout cusswords
I'm talkin' 'bout this word, often said
But do we mean it?
Heh, I'ma tell you 'bout L-O-V-E, know what I'm sayin'
You get around your crew, I'm just 'aiight'
Heh, but you ain't say that last night
For real, you know, it's all gravy baby
Uh, yeah, it's all gravy baby
But uh, I'ma break it down to you like this
Uh, uh, hit me

Tryin' to get nobody comin' at me
Cuz you with your good buddy
It seems to me it's all of a sudden
Cuz the night before
You treated me so different, see

Tryna say it wasn't too funny
Sayin' that you playin' like you really love me
Sweet nothings, so you can
Cut somethin', touch somethin'
Last night you really thought you
Were tryna do something

Don't you want me?

You said before me
Your relationships were short
They never did last too long
Said every time you thought
You found pretty Mrs. Right
She turned out to be Mrs. Wrong

You always worked late
Didn't have much time to play
And she couldn't relate to you
She couldn't understand
You're a hardworking man
You need a woman like me who do
Cuz I'll say

Go and get your paper, babe
You won't hear nothing out of me
Honey ain't no time for play
See the bills got to get paid

We gotta eat everyday
And nothing in life comes for free
So go ahead and get what you can
I got your back, baby, be a man

So now you found me

My song, Changing Faces
Introducing Brett
You, you want me to tell you?
I mean, do you really want me to tell you?

[Changing Faces]
What is it about you?
Just tell me how you do what you do to me
Whatever you want to
No questions asked, you know it's okay with me
You can't do nothing wrong
You know just where to go, how to play with me
We can play all night long
'cause with you all night long, is where I wanna be

You got me doin' things I never did before
And when you touch me, you open every door
I'm not afraid to see how much you mean to me
No, I just can't explain what you're doin' to me

Chorus
What are you doin' to me? Tell me
(What you're doin' to me, baby tell me, what you're doin' to me)
What are you doin' to me? Tell me
(What you're doin' to me, baby tell me, what you're doin' to me)
What are you doin' to me? Tell me
(What you're doin' to me, baby tell me, what you're doin' to me)
What are you doin' to me? Tell me

How many times
Did she let you down?
You came to me when she
Was nowhere to be found
She would apologize
And you'd let her in

How many times
When you were together
And you'd catch her on the phone
Tellin' you he was just a friend
When will you realize
That it just ain't right

Chorus
I will never leave you by yourself
Turn my back on you for someone else
She may have done those things
But that ain't me
I will never leave you all alone, no
Turn away from where I belong
Although she let you down

(Malik)
Hey what's up?
Leave your name and your number
And I'll call you back
God bless

(Changing Faces)
It's been so long
Since I've held you
Yet thoughts of you come to me
And your face appears while lying here
It's like never being here without you
And even when you're far away
I appreciate you every day

I may be in Japan
London or France
No matter where I am
You're still my man
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Whenever you should call
No matter where I am
You're still my man

Even I write undertone love songs

You told me, I heard it all before
You lied to me, can't take no more
Have I told you lately, mmm
How much you mean to me, heh
You are my lady, heh
And it's no mystery, mm-mm

What you do to me
See I know I done you wrong, oh yeah babe
But baby I just wanna move on
See I wish I could do it all over again, heh
'Cause I would never ever hurt my best friend
Baby I know I told you once before

Girl, I told you - you told me
That I loved you - I heard it all before
I told you that I cared - can't take no more
I told you - it's too much
I'd be there for you - you lied to me
Forever - you told me I was the only one
You don't believe me - boy I don't
Don't mistreat me - it's too much
Girl I'm sorry - it's not good enough
I'm on my knees - boy just get up
See I told you - you told me
That I loved you - I heard it all before
Forever - you told me we'd be together for life

It's so hard to forget
All the pain you put me through
How could you throw it all away
And expect me to stay
You went away

How y'all doin' out there? (crowd cheers)
Alright, y'all sound good, haha
We gon' need y'all to help us out here
Where are those love lights at?
Take 'em out your pocket, put them up
'cause we need to see them, c'mon y'all
We got somethin' we wanna ask you
How many of you out there are in love? (crowd cheers)
Woo, a lot of lovers in the house tonight, huh?
Yeah, woo
Well, we're in love ourselves
And it feels good to be in love
Especially when your lover is your best friend (definitely)
Haha, alright y'all

Thinkin', evaluatin' our situation, oh yeah
Came to the conclusion, don't wanna lose ya
Without you, what would I do?
I see you, I see myself
We're so compatible, don't need nobody else
Surround myself with you, 'cause you're so good for me
And I really believe that baby

Hey yeah yeah
Mmm, hmm
Yeah

I know it's unbelievable
That we've come to an end
In spite of all that we've been through
I hope we'll still be friends
It's hard to think of losing you
But everything has changed
Except the love I feel for you
That much remains the same

All the roads that we travelled
Are moving apart
And although it hurts me so
To let you go
It's time for you to start
To follow your dreams
While I follow mine
I guess it's time for us to say goodbye
Don't cry

I can? t be that other woman
I can? t be that other woman

You only see me every Friday night at 9
Can? t imagine whatchu told her this time
You never take me to a public place
Worried that somebody might notice your face

First to the liquor store and then a motel
Call up your friends just to cover your trail
Not a word until the week goes by
You call me when you want some pie

Why am I crying every night over you?
You're never gonna leave her
Finally, I woke up and smelt the coffee
I understand
Why two women can? t share one man

I can? t be that other woman
I can? t love you down cant keep creapin' around
Can? t be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more

Can? t be that other woman
I can? t love it down cant keep creepin' around
Can? t be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more

You never see me on the holidays
You disappear and won? t return my page
You take my body in the middle of the night
I ain? t gon lie 'coz boy you do it so right

And then you melt me with them same 3 words
Sweetest seduction that I ever heard

Freedom rider though you've tried
Words are not enough for you now
It's hard on your pride
I can't find you though I know you
You are just a step out of line
Come closer to me

When the lines are drawn
And no one comes to break us down
And the walls that stood between us
Tumble to the ground
It's time to find someone to run to

I've got a place in mind
It's known as conscience point
It's where the clouds roll by
They say that nothin' really matters
I'm goin' out to find
Why people come this way
And put the past behind

still feel your presence
though you're not around
reminiscing on our ups and our downs

still feel your presence

wishing you were here

if i had one wish, i would wish that you were here
cos when i look over my shoulder
could have sworn that you were there
