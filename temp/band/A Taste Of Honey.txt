If you're thinkin' you're too cool to boogie
Boy, oh boy, have I got news for you?
Everybody here tonight was boogin'
Let me tell you
You are no exception to the rule

Get on up on the floor
'Cause we're gonna boogie oogie oogie
Till you just can't boogie no more
Boogie no more

You can't boogie no more
(Boogie)
Boogie no more
Listen to the music

There's no time to waste, let's get this show on the road
Listen to the music and let your body float
The sooner we begin the longer we've got the groove
Listen to the music and let your body move

Now get on up on the floor
'Cause we're gonna boogie oogie oogie
Till you just can't boogie no more

It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue
But you've disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears
...

I was down i was barely makin it
she was gone and i couldn't take it
i was looking for a new way of thinkin
but when i go to sleep, i'd pray i wouldn't wake up

well i want you
i want you to rescue me

the world kept turning
but i stood still
like the shadow looking for a man
did i play to win
or did i win to lose
of all the times i haven't had a clue
there's people tellin me, about the things i do
the more i here the less i see in the truth
oh well i'm on the edge, i can't look down
oh, slipping slipping slipping oh yea

Nice place you got here

Vicious woman with a sweet smile ramble on
Your the kind of sweetheart who wants it all
You can be what you want to and get away with it
To me you are just a pretty face
You don't really think too much

You can lead me to water, but I won't drink
You can take me to bed, just don't lead me on

(Lead me on, lead me on)
Don't lead me on, whoo!
(Lead me on, lead me on)
I don't like it like that

You can tell me stories, I'm all ears
To me it's just repetition, honey, I had it for years
Sweet bar, sweet woman, sweet drinks don't mix
It's the only place I can get my kicks

You can lead me to water, but I won't drink
You can take me to bed, girl, but I won't sink
You can play my guitar, but that's not love
Hey, shining star, just don't lead me on

Listen to the music and let your body float
The sooner we begin the longer we've got the groove
Listen to the music and let your body move

Now get on up on the floor
'Cause we're gonna boogie oogie oogie
Till you just can't boogie no more

Hello love, ypu're so sweet
You spotted me for a second
If it's a crime to want your time
I've just begun to love ...heaven...
I don't mean to be so rude
Even though I seem kind of crude
But I can see that you'd be good for me
I know, I think of you

Ah we can make a new world (when we begin)
Ah together you and I (I know you can)
Ah let's make a new world

It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue
But you've disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears

Now I've heard that you've been lookin' for some lovin'
Someone to take you by the hand
I want you to know that I've got plenty of honey
What I'm sayin' is baby here I am

Come on and get down while you can
Close your eyes and feel the vibe of the music
Don't hold back, let it go
Don't be afraid 'cause it's okay to let it flow

Hey, do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good

Come on and do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good (Yeah)

Hmm... hmm... hmm... 
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Move your body to the disco beat

The stage is set now, the light's on you
You can do it, get into it, feel it through and through
Don't be shy, get it on
And put your hand on your hips, let your back bone slip, now get it on

Hey, do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good

Come on and do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good

Everybody do it
Do it, do it good
...

Relax and stay awhile
Oo-oo-oo
With me

I really love your style
Oo-oo-oo
Can't you see?

Dreams really do come true
If you believe
They do

And I believe in you
Oo-oo-oo
Can't you see?
