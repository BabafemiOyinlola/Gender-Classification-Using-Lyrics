Hear squeaky clean music with full effect

MC-ing the birthday party of my main duck Donald

TAG TEAM: We? re kickin the floor

Donald Duck, back again
Turn up the music, let? s begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
Party with Donald, Daisy, and the boys
There? s a party over here, party over there
Tossin? Donald up in the air
Now tryin to catch him, he falls down

WHOOMP, there he went (hit the ground)

Together: Movin, groovin, OUTTA SIGHT!

Tag Team: Donald Duck steps from the old school
He? s no fool, he? s soo cool

Grab a girl and bump and grind.(ooh)

Round and round you go to and fro i'm with that flow.
With my, napsack full old school raps
That be strapped with a kid
Cant clap like this

On here is the s**t i re-transmit this song to
Rock a party like the kids get high when they see Barney

What a rush when i buck straight from this rhyme called cush
Give it up, whats up?
Tag Team's musics always in the cut
So c'mon let me see you sweat
Boogie on down from cup to set
We kick the bling from long ago
Sing oweeo oweeo oweeo you go

Oweeo. Oooh. Oweeo. Oooh.

MICKEY:
PARTY PEOPLE!
Hear squeaky clean music with full effect
That? s me, Mickey, the Mouse Supreme
MC-ing the birthday party of my main duck Donald

TAG TEAM: We? re kickin the floor
and we gonna do it sumthin like this

Donald Duck, back again
Turn up the music, let? s begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
Party with Donald, Daisy, and the boys
There? s a party over here, party over there
Tossin? Donald up in the air
Now tryin to catch him, he falls down

WHOOMP, there he went (hit the ground)

WHOOMP, there he went (mickey: go tag team)
WHOOMP, there he went (minnie: get busy)
WHOOMP, there he went (goofy: ~chuckle~ uh hummph)
WHOOMP, there he went (mickey: lets go)
WHOOMP, there he went (minnie: a little louder)
WHOOMP, there he went (goofy: auuhhhh oooohh)
WHOOMP, there he went (mickey: come on now)
WHOOMP, there he went (minnie: lemme hear ya)

Upside down and inside out
Donald's swarmin the floor, throwing Daisy about

Minnie: Twirl to the left
Mickey: Twist to the right

Together: Movin, groovin, OUTTA SIGHT!

Tag Team: Donald Duck steps from the old school
He? s no fool, he? s soo cool

Mickey: He'ss doin a dip, a Daisy slip

Tag Team: Whoomp, there she went (goofy: hit the ground)

WHOOMP, there she went (tag team: come on yall)
WHOOMP, there she went (tag team: a little louder)
WHOOMP, there she went (tag team: come on yall)
WHOOMP, there she went (tag team: louder)
WHOOMP, there she went (tag team: come on yall)
WHOOMP, there she went (tag team: a little louder )
WHOOMP, there she went
WHOOMP, there she went

Oweeo-Tag Team

oweeo. ooooh. oweeo. oooh. oweeo. oooh. oweeo. oooh.

All the playas in the front.(ooh)
All the playas in the back.(ooh)
All the playas on the sides.(ooh)
Grab a girl and bump and grind.(ooh)

Round and round you go to and fro i'm with that flow.
With my, napsack full old school raps
That be strapped with a kid
Cant clap like this

On here is the s**t i re-transmit this song to
Rock a party like the kids get high when they see Barney

What a rush when i buck straight from this rhyme called cush
Give it up, whats up?
Tag Team's musics always in the cut
So c'mon let me see you sweat
Boogie on down from cup to set
We kick the bling from long ago
Sing oweeo oweeo oweeo you go

Oweeo. Oooh. Oweeo. Oooh.

we're kickin' the flow - we're kickin' the flow
and it goes a little something like this
tag team back again
check its records lets begin
party on party people let me hear some noise
dc's in the house jump jump rejoice
there's a party over here
a party over there
wave your hands in the air
shake your derrier
these three words when you're getting busy
say whoomp there it is - hit me
upside down inside out
i'm about to show all you folks what's it all about
now it's time for me to get on a mic
and make this tag team party hype
i'm taking you back to the old school
cause i'm an old fool who's so cool
if you wanna get down let me show you the way
whoomp there it is
let me hear you say
whoomp there it is
whoomp there it is
whoomp there it is
whoomp there it is
