Seven light years below sea level we go
Welcome to Stankonia
The place from which all funky things come
Would you like to come?

You ain't a hater can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealin` with ain't nutty but the study gon` unveil

My relative in jail, ha, stay engaged
To whatever make money now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever after but I'm tangled in my cord

Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat

The damsel's in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin' warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw

A double diamond party in the north pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will turn up man, to see who can be me
Better than me it's a permanent, smile on my face

Stage in city life no one said that it was right
But I got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
‘Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on the finger, couple of kids to minivans
Standin’ in the stands like a fan watch her little man run
(Ball!)

And every time you see the family they look happy
Got a mama and a daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide

Kept the yam and the pie, the spouse and the house
Boy, it’s cheaper to keep her, you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
(Motherfucker shit goddamn asshole)
Took my shit

Back when I was a freshman I learned a valuable lesson
A hoe gon’ be a hoe and it don't matter about U stressin'
The only thing U do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when U feel rejection

Evidence and DNA drop down stainin’ her dress
She's making a great big mess, can I get something off UR chest?
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' wit ya hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one?

I, I wanna get N2U
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get N2U
I wanna get N2U
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get N2U

Now that I'm a graduate, she’s still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch so U can stab it
Jug jug, more jug, push, pull, more wood

It's good to have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Y'all already know what it is
God don't make no mistakes

Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
Pointing always in da vice from spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta

'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog
Back in '94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy

Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen minds, now let's deliver to the masses

It's been a good long road, now it's time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings and high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

N-n-n-not too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
But things have changed (it ain't so simple)
Now life is a musical

I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said "hey hold up 'fore we put out another song"
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
Cause ain't nothin changed (it's simple)
Now let's make a musical

Starts off like a small-town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

And I'm a star

Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood wit cameras on
I really think they stealin' from us like a sampled song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home

The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a durn country song
This whole country wrong, oh but you right
If you just put a little ice on and cut ya mic on

But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant cobra
I'm so not sober, I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller

Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it? uh, bling bling I know
And did you know I'm the creator of the term
I just straightened the perm?

They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle but they urn
Like a dead body burned on the mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like it's candle grease

And I be's the little nigga, cooler than antifreeze
Defrost on your window pane, Lil' Wayne
But in Hollywood it's "Little" Wayne
It don't make me numb, so that's why I got a prenumb
I do

Starts off like a small-town marriage

Zora and Rooster under peach tree
They K-I-SS-I-N-G
Wow, first came he love
Now then comes the marriage
One baby, two baby, three baby carriage baby

Welcome to my world, oceans vs. mountains
(Welcome to her world, oceans versus mountains)
Call me the poor girl cause I love to fight them
(Call her the poor girl cause she loves to fight them)

But I'm quite sweet if you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love but not that type of guy

Ooh wee, you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walkin' and the world's the wire
Remember kissin' on Broadway, you die
I was bein' your baby and tickin' and tockin' your clock

See we done jumped the broom and now you know I'm good
And I was dreamin' bout children Emily Ann
Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me
(It meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love

Baby how could you just go and change it all
You turned my spring to fall
I needed you you know
But when the love is gone it's time to go

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done, enough of your love
I said I'm done, enough of your love

I'm up til 3 o'clock in the mornin'
While you party until the dawn
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love

What if everything you ever knew or known was lost
The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
cause your mind ain't free, constricting by the motherf**kin' boundaries
An ounce of weed or an pound of dro
Couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting life from bro

Cadillac on bows, strike a pose then the door slams, wham nigga wham, don't they say that in they show damn
For show man, actin like a tadpole out of gonads, you now how catch the truth, hit the booth we makin more jams
Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program, f**k the learning curve

That's a dawn type a nigga for the home invasion surprise prise

Motherfucker, pow pow! Lay the fuck down now
Now naw, don't try and talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try ya

Seven light years below sea level we go
Welcome to Stankonia

You ain't a hater can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealin` with ain't nutty but the study gon` unveil

My relative in jail, ha, stay engaged
To whatever make money now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever after but I'm tangled in my cord

Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat

The damsel's in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin' warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw

A double diamond party in the north pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will turn up man, to see who can be me
Better than me it's a permanent, smile on my face

Back when I was a freshman I learned a valuable lesson
A hoe gon’ be a hoe and it don't matter about U stressin'
The only thing U do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when U feel rejection

Evidence and DNA drop down stainin’ her dress
She's making a great big mess, can I get something off UR chest?
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' wit ya hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one?

I, I wanna get N2U
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get N2U
I wanna get N2U
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get N2U

Now that I'm a graduate, she’s still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch so U can stab it
Jug jug, more jug, push, pull, more wood

Starts off like a small-town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

And I'm a star

Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood wit cameras on
I really think they stealin' from us like a sampled song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home

The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a durn country song
This whole country wrong, oh but you right
If you just put a little ice on and cut ya mic on

But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant cobra
I'm so not sober, I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller

Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it? uh, bling bling I know
And did you know I'm the creator of the term
I just straightened the perm?

They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle but they urn
Like a dead body burned on the mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like it's candle grease

And I be's the little nigga, cooler than antifreeze
Defrost on your window pane, Lil' Wayne
But in Hollywood it's "Little" Wayne
It don't make me numb, so that's why I got a prenumb
I do

Starts off like a small-town marriage

Wow, first came he love
Now then comes the marriage
One baby, two baby, three baby carriage baby

Welcome to my world, oceans vs. mountains
(Welcome to her world, oceans versus mountains)
Call me the poor girl cause I love to fight them
(Call her the poor girl cause she loves to fight them)

But I'm quite sweet if you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love but not that type of guy

Ooh wee, you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walkin' and the world's the wire
Remember kissin' on Broadway, you die
I was bein' your baby and tickin' and tockin' your clock

See we done jumped the broom and now you know I'm good
And I was dreamin' bout children Emily Ann
Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me
(It meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love

Baby how could you just go and change it all
You turned my spring to fall
I needed you you know
But when the love is gone it's time to go

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done, enough of your love
I said I'm done, enough of your love

I'm up til 3 o'clock in the mornin'
While you party until the dawn
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love

The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center

Couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting life from bro

Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
and she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin over foodstamps, and hittin a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts, lickin leaves, rollin reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggaz around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me

Makin a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin the hoe down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Daver, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer eight-hundred-forty
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
but I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearin a real tight skirt
She was, fine as FUCK, I wanted to sex the hoe up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do.

Verse 1: (sleepy brown)
dickie shorts and lincoln's clean, leaning checking out the scene
gangsta boys bligga's lit, riding out talking shit
nigga where you wanna go, you know the club don't close til four
let's party til we can't no more, watch out here come the folks
(andre 3000)
as the plot thickens it gives me the dickens
reminiscent of charles, a lil' disco-tech nestled in the ghettos
of niggaville, USA via Atlanta, georgia, a lil' spot where
young men and young women go to experience they first lil'
taste of nightlife, me? well, I've never been there, well perhaps once
but I was so engulfed in the "E"
I never made it to the door you speak of hard core
while the dj sweating out all the problems and troubles of the day
while this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors

Piece by piece this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys let the lies go
If you wanna be a hoe go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch represents and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs to feed takin what we need
To succeed you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared
If you scared, say you scared

Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a fuck what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out
If you scared, say you scared

(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those)
How many times I, sit back and contemplate
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm tellin my story.
My relationship, with my folks is give and take
And I done took so much, not givin my glory
Now have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left uppa to me, and my momma n'em told me (yes she did)
I said I have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left uppa to me, and my momma n'em told me

No, nooo, noooooooo
I'm so tired, it's been so long - struggling, hopelessly
Seven and forty days. heyyy

Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home

But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordially
Invite you to an emotion filled theater
Bring your umbrella 'cause young fella it gets no weirder

We reign, reign supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock 'n' roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

So I typed a text to a girl I used to see

Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."

Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on

Caught out on the Vegas strip
Tell em' a good game, Juju pimpin'

From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker

Oh Hell, there he go again talkin' that shit
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spend
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out you scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B I G B O I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin' the shout out to my Uncle Darnnel locked up in prison
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care

Intro: Big Boi

Uhh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain, check it out

Verse One: Big Boi, Andre

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Pointe didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walkin to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin, but now I lay it to the flo'
just like carbon, cuz I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cuz we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
activity, my soliloquoy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call

Chorus: Andre

Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...
Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...

Verse Two: Big Boi, Andre

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies

Yo, we take no shit, like ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'

But not for long cuz we got a better sack to serve
Tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb

Oh yes I love her like Egyptian, want a description, my royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin' crickets and crows, bitches and hoes to queen things
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen things
like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
talkin' like that, man fuck them niggaz I'm goin' off
and comin' right back, like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems, Bankhead is better for em
When they can let they throw em, down from hitchikin' and bitin' niggas
until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend
like you Ms. Goodie, Four-Shoes, even Bo knew, that you got caught poked
like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas
of our chillun, they fuckin' a different nigga every time
they get the feelin' to, I'm willin' to go the extra kilo-meter
just to see my senorita get her pillow

Just like smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talkin about the click will get you laid down hella swoled up

While the rest of the country bungies offs
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs

They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bonified nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down
'Cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard

While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'

Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken,
Words of a chain I don't feel but I see,
visions from me
at twenty three making us free in my community
one day is what I live for,
ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
up in they rides,
looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G's
In the South Indies
my nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigger sellin', but can you blame
the fact the only way a brother can survive the game
the block hard to get by the dope dealing, fatal killings
in fair times so writing rhymes
it ain't just the police
we kill each other just lost another brother
fast living will get you took,
thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
off crooked schemes its just a dream
floating face down in the mainstream

Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen

At times, I think I'm crazy, so I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick... Bowe

It's killing me--thinking that all these niggas
See they fly shit--thinking they steven segall an

Intro: Big Rube

Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
that we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level -- what are we doing?
Foolin ourself, clownin ourself, playin ourself
By not bein ourself
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get our meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on the section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind rumbing reality of horror
known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon...

(My memories of yesterday...)

cut and scratched: "Ninety-six gonna be that hit..."

Verse One: Andre

Them niggas that's on that blow
That run up in yo' crib which contains
Your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
They do not want to hear it because they'd
Rather be bouncin' and shootin' and killin' and bouncin'
And shit get down

Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that thank [think] you soft
And say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches & switches & hoes & clothes & weed
Let's talk about time travelin' rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin' get down

Return of the gangsta thanks ta'

Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to da back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump wit us
We da type of people make da club get crunk
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to da back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump wit us
We da type of people make da club get crunk

Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We taking another route to represent the Dungeon family
Like Great Day, me and and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin every city when we headed to that bat cave
A-T-L, Georgia, what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you soundin silly, thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doin doughnuts round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn, we the committee, gone burn it down
But us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to da back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump wit us
We da type of people make da club get crunk
Ah ha, hush dat fuss

Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
But skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say, "I be god damnit they done changed the rules"

Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
But skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say, "I be god damnit they done changed the rules"

The common denominator, the nigga numerator
Never know who the hater, niggaz cater to your ego
I'm sorry like Atari whose the cousin to Coleco
Vision caught a Rico, back on the street like Chico
DeBarge, he large and got a 'Llac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my Lawd

One at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party women jump for joy
But all the wild niggaz schemin' they gon' jump the boy
For spittin' all that bourgeoisie, my watch, my car
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far

Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
But skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say, "I be god damnit they done changed the rules"

Old school players to new school fools

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I, Aquemini

[Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on the bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping is a must
Is you on the that dust or cornstarch familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman how and the fuck you think we gon do that man
Riding around Old National on 18's without no gat man
Im strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fittin
But now we tappin the breaks from all of them corners that we be headin in a
Volkswagen and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't go get wood grain steering wheel
For real you can gon chill out and still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch

February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
and she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin over foodstamps, and hittin a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts, lickin leaves, rollin reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggaz around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me

Yea.
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she SCREWED a lot
Makin a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin the hoe down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Daver, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer eight-hundred-forty
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
but I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearin a real tight skirt
She was, fine as FUCK, I wanted to sex the hoe up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do.
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too."
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster
It's like that now

Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the funk is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon ("Hello?")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign

Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later

Be careful, watch your back, blackbirds don't wear disguise
How we comin, comin hard. camels too slow
Stick up kids do anything, hustlers keep loot to show (what?)

Just begun a game so considered a beginner

Fuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nicks

And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs to feed takin what we need
To succeed you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared
If you scared, say you scared

Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a fuck what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out
If you scared, say you scared

Slum beautiful, drivin' I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazin'

They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darlin' you make me loose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where, I had to give your mama a call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
For all its worth, girl what's your frequency
And can I come there frequently?

Slum beautiful, drivin' I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazin'

What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be makin' my game more flagrant
And once I done had some cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies

What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

You make me understand
What it means to be in L O V E once again
Why must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow?

Stank love, stank love
Stank love, stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love

Boom, boom, boom
Heh, heh

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little actin'
Now that's for anyone askin'
Give me one, pass 'em
Drip, drip, drop there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin' out the side of your face
We tappin' right into your memory banks thanks

So click-it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin', like two midgets in the back seat wrestlin'
Speaker box vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

I like the way you move

Because she loves me so

But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killin' me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together

Hey ya! Hey ya!

Hey ya! Hey ya!

Hey ya! Hey ya!

One, one, one for the money yes, uhh, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin' ta find that hookup

Now, everyday we look up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur

Writin' rhymes tryin' ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin' no G's
And that's a nono

Yeah, uhh, check it, ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin'
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin', they payin'

We stay in layin' vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
Around this bitch

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz

Stage in city life no one said that it was right
But I got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
? Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on the finger, couple of kids to minivans
Standin? in the stands like a fan watch her little man run
(Ball!)

And every time you see the family they look happy
Got a mama and a daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide

Kept the yam and the pie, the spouse and the house
Boy, it? s cheaper to keep her, you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
 (Motherfucker shit goddamn asshole)
Took my shit

Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggaz
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fuking head
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood
You better be strapped cuz them niggaz over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, servin the loyal customers
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggaz be wanting drinks and shit from the fuking sto', yo
But that's aight, tho', cuz I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five

I'll be comin around the ghetto when I come kickin one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm pickin up and throwin 'em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cuz I slam those Southern bitches
I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

Chorus: Cee-Lo

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me (repeat 4X)

As I step, the stage is empty
No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang

It's beginnin' to look a lot like what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's 'bout ta go in depth
This is the way I creep my season here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract so shut up that, nonsense about some solid solid
I gots in crunk if it ain't real ain't right

I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with smith, I sip my fifth, I chill with wess'
And got my reasons so tell me what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all "deck, the the
Oh naw, I got other means of celebratin'

Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hoe sellers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claimin true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money cuz my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothin wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that

I don't recall, ever graduatin at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asked to give me some livin life like a mofo
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
As act as though you know somethin I don't. Do you have any suggestions?
Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin
Sick of takin trash out and toilet bowl cleanin
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin
Naw, that ain't what I'm about

Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little actin'
Now that's for anyone askin'
Give me one, pass 'em
Drip, drip, drop there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin' out the side of your face
We tappin' right into your memory banks thanks

So click-it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin', like two midgets in the back seat wrestlin'
Speaker box vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

Hold up
Oooh, oooh, somebody done told you you wrong

[Verse 1]
OK, I started out all alone
Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginnin to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm livin it through this song
A movin vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset!
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escapin me
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win

[Hook]
Throw your neck out, throw your back out [4x]

Ghosts and goblins run a muck
In the caverns of Rhine
Slinging petty corruption
The seventh sign
Give it to you
Give to you and I do what it takes
To give it to you
Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggaz that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered

(Verse 1):
Get the f*** up off me nigga!
As I struggle to keep my balance and composure
I'm 'posed to propose a toast to the players on every coast of
The lyrical rollercoaster, Mind Bender
'Stead of watching these sucker emcees
I'm seeing just how they're lyin' to the general population
Don't be patient, get up and stand up for your life
Do you agree or understand that we lost some rights since 1-1-9?
Come dumb, come young, come blind
Unwind, confined to the situation we facin', 'cause it's time
Tic, Tic Boom!

[Verse One: Big Boi]
Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is goin downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
don't think that I can get out this hole
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday livin
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they livin

Yo
Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even goin say the motherfucking rest
You know
We talk about it all day long baby
We fin'a break you off with some brand new shit

[C-Bone]
This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and had a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
She'll be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe

[Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Lil' Brotha]
You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch

Fuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop

Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high
(From this point on it only gets rougher)

Well here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly, like in 'Living Color"'s Wanda, word up
Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle
Or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort
So make it last for the risk you took
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels
And a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards

All you got in the refrigerator is Bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge

I brought the whole hood with me
You got red dirt in your afro
Young Hov' in the place to be
Outkast in the place to be

Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block?
Didn't have to break a steerin' column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two shoes, that what they call ya
Never judge a person or a book by its covers
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself boi
Are you Black, White, Asian, Indonesian, or Borean?
That's Black and Korean

We on the same team if we breathin'
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seein'
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it 'cause they scared we gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power, the cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height
Because I might just snap on a fuck ass nigga
Might clap a cap at a sucka ass nigga

In the meantime, Daddy Fatsacks gon' chill out
He might just pull out his pistol
And let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kent, you better be way harder
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
Ain't no uno, we a duo, deuce dos to a pair

A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levis and toughskins, one minus one
Negative one minus negative one is nothin'
Bustin' D boy raps and player poems

Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existance
We livin, breathin, soon we'll be teethin
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Donnel and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint
Reset

But that's alright
Ya'll won't believe in me anyway but

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Leprechauns or ground hogs
No thank you Easter Bunny
There's all this talk about Santa Claus
But see love will rule supreme

Happy Valentine's Day

You got it
When cupid knocks at your door
You can't ignore me
There's no need to run

So Happy Valentine's Day

If you know what love means, well

'Cuz, they just don't believe in me

Ya won't believe in me

I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like "yeah, nigga right"
But you gave me you number anyway you were on the talcum
Powder, how's about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a mission impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page but in
The same book of life so I'd paged you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We starting hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking cool
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be
Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggaz in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?
Well, yes and no
Yes we were selling it
But no it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled "ho"
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Packed full of niggaz with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied see you later when he got the good news, that's life shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got glock and a low jack

But monkey wrenches was thrown like chairs kings sit on

My prayers seem to long I fall asleep before the endin'
Don't even get to say "Amen"

Or maybe it's the Devil infiltrating and like Riddick bow
I've been fighting this since them fetus days

It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doin' dirt
What am I supposed to do?

That run up in yo' crib which contains
Your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
They do not want to hear it because they'd
Rather be bouncin' and shootin' and killin' and bouncin'
And shit get down

Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that thank [think] you soft
And say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches & switches & hoes & clothes & weed
Let's talk about time travelin' rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin' get down

Man the scene was so thick
Low riders, seventy-seven Seville, El Dawgs
Nuttin' but them 'llacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking 'bout black man heaven heah, yknahmsayin', yeah

It's beginnin' to look a lot like what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's 'bout ta go in depth
This is the way I creep my season here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract so shut up that, nonsense about some solid solid
I gots in crunk if it ain't real ain't right

I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with smith, I sip my fifth, I chill with wess'
And got my reasons so tell me what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all "deck, the the
Oh naw, I got other means of celebratin'
I'm gettin' blizzard at hojo, I got that hoochie waitin'
I made it through another year can't ask fo' nothin' much mo'
It's OutKast for the boots I thought you knew so now you know
Let's go

All the players came from far and wide
Wearin' Afros and braids, kickin' them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya there's a better day
When the player's ball is happenin', all day ery'day

And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh Hell, there he go again talkin' that shit

Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spend

You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out you scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles

Daddy fat sacks, B I G B O I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin' the shout out to my Uncle Donnel locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer

And wave 'em like you just don't care

Even when things go slow
Hold on and don't let go

The Braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over
With this * off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed
Under the arm rest, under the leather
Thinkin' of startin ways
To make my life a little better

Takin a chunk up out my check
And makin my rhymes just look like practice
Buyin' clothing, Range Roving

Don't speak about the Dirty South

Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin' ta find that hookup

Now, everyday we look up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur

Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop

Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise

Yeah, somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Good and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots

Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin' the hoe down, never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Daver, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur

Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer eight-hundred-forty
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me

But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the hoe up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"

I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too"

That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare shit, medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down

She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit, you never got a chance
To hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts
For my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

This is such an art, where do I begin uh.
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fine
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin
To look sexy, but even if she was so what
Mother fucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day,
well this is that In fact,

About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the southern states,
you know where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ask Scott to match the socks, what's in your 'Speakerboxxx'

You got me open, you're playin wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if I need a baker bring's the joy, you're a kiner,

Always asked to give me some livin' life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown

You shouldn't hold that against me though

Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I
Get high but I don't get too high, so what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know somethin' I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
'Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin'
Sick of takin' trash out and toilet bowl cleanin'
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin'
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin'
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue travelin' this route without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't spend all your time tryin' to get high
Nigga you need git up, git out and git somethin'
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'

Got, only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claimin' broke but I be sayin' they pro-cras-ti-natin'
Settlin' for less, bet' be ready when they roll up in your nest and
Sink one in your chest and you is gone, up outta here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, whassup

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggaz can't let niggaz they don't understand
(What's the master plan?)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

So check me out, see once in a while when niggaz be tryin'
To test me I gets frisky grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but shit they missed me I'm gettin' nice
With them thangs, because I do like that you heard me on the radio
And yes my man I'm true to dat I run my lyrics the way
Y'all wanna hear 'em and shoot my dice like it's the brick
The way that wall done flicks 'em nigga, so ring around the roses
Diamonds around my neck from flexin' but I'm runnin' niggaz

What's wrong? What are you afraid of?
The Love Below


She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
but she lives in my lap


CHORUS
She lives in my lap (x6)
Forever my fiance

Now, everyday we look up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur

Writin' rhymes tryin' ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin' no G's
And that's a nono

Yeah, uhh, check it, ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin'
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin', they payin'

We stay in layin' vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me

Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend

Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas

To the studio tryin' to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private schools, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't no one to lay down
She wanna rip you up start a custody war, my lawyer stay down
She never had a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided

Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried

Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce

Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi

Intro: Big Boi

Uhh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain, check it out

Verse One: Big Boi, Andre

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Pointe didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walkin to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin, but now I lay it to the flo'
just like carbon, cuz I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cuz we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
activity, my soliloquoy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call

Chorus: Andre

Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...
Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...

Verse Two: Big Boi, Andre

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies

Yo, we take no shit, like ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'

But not for long cuz we got a better sack to serve
Tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb

But not no guillotine see, we be them southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready fo yo lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-City high school, was pullin em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and layin em down was just a habit
Just like smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talkin about the click will get you laid down hella swoled up
Hootie hoo slapped ya boyz across the cheek wit Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhymin

I came into this world high as a bird
From second hand cocaine powder
I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies offs
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs

They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bonified nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down
'Cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard

While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you, in you
(Yo, yo, yo)

I'm fascinated by the way yo
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me, freaky you
Can't help but be aroused

In the zone like Keyser Soze, always the usual suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And southern pride I be, checkin' my fuckin' head
Scared, lookin' up in your face, Boy I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies in the P's freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs

Only the twenty piece mojo, flow zone like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could yo' hoe go

Never bakin', rebukin' satan, we had you waitin'

Verse 1:

Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken,
Words of a chain I don't feel but I see,
visions from me
at twenty three making us free in my community
one day is what I live for,
ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
up in they rides,
looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G's
In the South Indies
my nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigger sellin', but can you blame
the fact the only way a brother can survive the game
the block hard to get by the dope dealing, fatal killings
in fair times so writing rhymes
it ain't just the police
we kill each other just lost another brother
fast living will get you took,
thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
off crooked schemes its just a dream
floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream

Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell em da money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in... naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who us a dime

Ready to go at any moment, jumpin like a pogo stick
I never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacin
Back and forth, inside, I'm melting like water on wicked bitches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, so I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick... Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days

It's killing me--thinking that all these niggas
See they fly shit--thinking they steven segall an

Intro: Big Rube

Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
that we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level -- what are we doing?
Foolin ourself, clownin ourself, playin ourself
By not bein ourself
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get our meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on the section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind rumbing reality of horror
known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon...

(My memories of yesterday...)

cut and scratched: "Ninety-six gonna be that hit..."

Verse One: Andre

I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame

The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman how and the fuck you think we gon do that man
Riding around Old National on 18's without no gat man
Im strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fittin
But now we tappin the breaks from all of them corners that we be headin in a
Volkswagen and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't go get wood grain steering wheel
For real you can gon chill out and still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch

[Chorus] x2

February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
and she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin over foodstamps, and hittin a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts, lickin leaves, rollin reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggaz around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Yea.
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she SCREWED a lot
Makin a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin the hoe down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Daver, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer eight-hundred-forty
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
but I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearin a real tight skirt
She was, fine as FUCK, I wanted to sex the hoe up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do.
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too."
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster
It's like that now

"Baby, did you hear that?" "Yeah, baby, I heard it too"
Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the funk is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon ("Hello?")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'

Mahogany team queens up on the rise
Be careful, watch your back, blackbirds don't wear disguise
How we comin, comin hard. camels too slow
Stick up kids do anything, hustlers keep loot to show (what?)
The game is hot you could never be a winner
Just begun a game so considered a beginner
Masada for real, this shorty here is here to say
Mahogany go platinum after after that we just parlay
I'm from the Bricks we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks
Fuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nicks
This life is plus I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want
italiano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?
Can't be a joke I've been through too many games
Niggaz laugh, but my expression wasn't hardly the same
Show me respect cause it's due, you keep the fear
cause I'll get over and believe I'll come back at you

Niggaz all dogs? If niggaz all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and hear done got to drankin
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drink

All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga round me playin' married
Or payin' child support

Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport

Pray I live to see the day when seven's happily married
With kids, woe woe

And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck

I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

Be what you want to be, long as you know
Consequences are given for living the fence is
Too high to jump in jail, too low to dig

Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer.

Soul gold grill, and a baby mamma
Black Cadillac and a pack of pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS

Make a nigga want to stay on tour for days
Get back home, thangs are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along

Answer quick do you know what desire is? Huh?
Apparently not that's why you get what you got
Now answer this do you know what fire is? Yeah

Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Thank I'm finna vom? Ya move like ya mean it she'll cum

Greetings, earthlings

From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

Well, it's the M I crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh Hell, there he go again talkin' that shit
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spend
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out you scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B I G B O I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin' the shout out to my Uncle Darnnel locked up in prison
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit

Intro: Big Boi

Uhh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain, check it out

Verse One: Big Boi, Andre

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Pointe didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walkin to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin, but now I lay it to the flo'
just like carbon, cuz I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cuz we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
activity, my soliloquoy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call

Chorus: Andre

Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...
Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...

Verse Two: Big Boi, Andre

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies

Yo, we take no shit, like ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'

But not for long cuz we got a better sack to serve
Tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb

[Andre]
Yeah
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian, want a description, my royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin' crickets and crows, bitches and hoes to queen things
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen things
like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
talkin' like that, man fuck them niggaz I'm goin' off
and comin' right back, like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems, Bankhead is better for em
When they can let they throw em, down from hitchikin' and bitin' niggas
until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend
like you Ms. Goodie, Four-Shoes, even Bo knew, that you got caught poked
like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas
of our chillun, they fuckin' a different nigga every time
they get the feelin' to, I'm willin' to go the extra kilo-meter
just to see my senorita get her pillow
on the side of my bed where no good ever stay

A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin' ta find that hookup

Now, everyday we look up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur

Writin' rhymes tryin' ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin' no G's
And that's a nono

Yeah, uhh, check it, ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin'
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin', they payin'

We stay in layin' vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
Around this bitch

Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz

Verse One: Big Boi

Under-cover, over da hills and thru tha woods I go
Like green lights, a southern nigga that's comin fo' yo' throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready fo yo lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-City high school, was pullin em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and layin em down was just a habit
Just like smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talkin about the click will get you laid down hella swoled up
Hootie hoo slapped ya boyz across the cheek wit Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhymin
Every lyric that he spit be turnin charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls

I came into this world high as a bird
From second hand cocaine powder
I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies offs
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs

They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bonified nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down
'Cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard

While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you, in you
(Yo, yo, yo)

I'm fascinated by the way yo
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me, freaky you
Can't help but be aroused

In the zone like Keyser Soze, always the usual suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And southern pride I be, checkin' my fuckin' head
Scared, lookin' up in your face, Boy I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies in the P's freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs

Only the twenty piece mojo, flow zone like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could yo' hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never bakin', rebukin' satan, we had you waitin'

Verse 1:

Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken,
Words of a chain I don't feel but I see,
visions from me
at twenty three making us free in my community
one day is what I live for,
ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
up in they rides,
looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G's
In the South Indies
my nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigger sellin', but can you blame
the fact the only way a brother can survive the game
the block hard to get by the dope dealing, fatal killings
in fair times so writing rhymes
it ain't just the police
we kill each other just lost another brother
fast living will get you took,
thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
off crooked schemes its just a dream
floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream

Verse One: Cool Breeze

I call da crib they say "Breeze you ain't know?"
I say "What?" "Big Time got popped in his Benzo!"
I said "Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell em da money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in... naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who us a dime
It's the Great Hoe Round Up Yo' Money time
I got to HAVE MINE, then I'm OUTTA HERE
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry bout yo' potnah gettin caught like a lame
It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang"

[Dre]
Me and everything around me, is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumpin like a pogo stick
I never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacin
Back and forth, inside, I'm melting like water on wicked bitches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, so I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick... Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doin dirt
What am I supposed to do?

Big Boi:

Peep what I say
Everyday--the sun sets just like clockwork
Put the glock to work
And puttin the body to standstlls
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss--niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue--cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me--thinking that all these niggas
See they fly shit--thinking they steven segall an
Balling--falling to the wayside when ya try to call
I've fallen--when we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
They get the tecs to flex--like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing no-no--not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme

Intro: Big Rube

Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
that we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level -- what are we doing?
Foolin ourself, clownin ourself, playin ourself
By not bein ourself
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get our meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on the section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind rumbing reality of horror
known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon...

(My memories of yesterday...)

cut and scratched: "Ninety-six gonna be that hit..."

Verse One: Andre

I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they makin they paper so I guess I can't complain... or can I?

With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin'
Hair with stylin' gel in it, throw a curl in it

[Chorus]
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I, Aquemini

[Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on the bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping is a must
Is you on the that dust or cornstarch familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman how and the fuck you think we gon do that man
Riding around Old National on 18's without no gat man
Im strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fittin
But now we tappin the breaks from all of them corners that we be headin in a
Volkswagen and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't go get wood grain steering wheel
For real you can gon chill out and still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch

In-slum-national, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Woo!)
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop a train
Who want some? Don't come un-prepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soaking wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
One-Nine-Nine-Nine, Anno Domini, anything goes, be whatchu wanna be
Long as you know consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell
HOT! Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer, soul gold grill and some baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of question with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe,
Believe there's always more, ahhhhh!

Yes sir, let me dig into your brain, folks fallin' like rain

Wettin' 'em up like splish, leavin' 'em in a splash

Of blood, the clock is tickin' niggaz from my block is missin'

Got, only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claimin' broke but I be sayin' they pro-cras-ti-natin'

Sink one in your chest and you is gone, up outta here for good

I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

So check me out, see once in a while when niggaz be tryin'
To test me I gets frisky grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but shit they missed me I'm gettin' nice
With them thangs, because I do like that you heard me on the radio
And yes my man I'm true to dat I run my lyrics the way

To the studio tryin' to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private schools, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't no one to lay down
She wanna rip you up start a custody war, my lawyer stay down
She never had a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts, on my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm talking about a black man's heaven, yea know what I'm saying?

I'm 'bout to go in depth, this is the way I greet

to say, the least no no it can't cease
so I begin to piece my two and two together, gots no snowy weather

I said subtract so shut up that, nonsense about some solid, solid I got
say crunk if it ain't real, it ain't right, I'm like no matter what the season

I got my reason so tell me what did you expect?

Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur

Writin' rhymes tryin' ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin' no G's

We stay in layin' vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise

Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
Don't spend all your time tryin to get high
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin

I don't recall, ever graduatin at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asked to give me some livin life like a mofo
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
As act as though you know somethin I don't. Do you have any suggestions?
Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin
Sick of takin trash out and toilet bowl cleanin
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue travelin this route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here

Comin up on ya from the south, the a-t-liens aint changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the a-town see
The home of the bankhead bounce, campbellton road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speakin of pullin yo' girl lookin at jheri curls you bitches
Everytime i ryhme for y'all, i'm lookin to prove a point
Kickin a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See i smoke good cuz see it go good wit them flows, why
The nigga the b-i-g like tony rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cuz yall niggas jokes like the joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like i'm tired of hoes in chokers

Who dem boyz that be havin the cronk every occasion

Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spend
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out you scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B I G B O I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin' the shout out to my Uncle Darnnel locked up in prison
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit

Intro: Big Boi

Uhh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain, check it out

Verse One: Big Boi, Andre

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Pointe didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walkin to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin, but now I lay it to the flo'
just like carbon, cuz I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cuz we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
activity, my soliloquoy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call

Chorus: Andre

Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...
Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...

Verse Two: Big Boi, Andre

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies

Yo, we take no shit, like ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'

But not for long cuz we got a better sack to serve
Tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb

Like green lights, a southern nigga that's comin fo' yo' throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready fo yo lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-City high school, was pullin em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and layin em down was just a habit
Just like smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talkin about the click will get you laid down hella swoled up
Hootie hoo slapped ya boyz across the cheek wit Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhymin

While the rest of the country bungies offs
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs

They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bonified nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down
'Cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard

While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'

Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs

Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long

Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick... Bowe

Intro: Big Rube

Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
that we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level -- what are we doing?
Foolin ourself, clownin ourself, playin ourself
By not bein ourself
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get our meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on the section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind rumbing reality of horror
known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon...

(My memories of yesterday...)

cut and scratched: "Ninety-six gonna be that hit..."

Verse One: Andre

I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame

'Cause you spoke up before I could look down
I woulda passed by shy without a sound
If you hadn't smiled and asked for the time
I said "I don't wear a watch"
You said "You wanna wear mine?"
And that was it
Photograph click click to the memory
You said "Walk me to class?"
I asked "Which one?"
Replied "Chemistry"
You was quicker than speedy crazy fast with the flirtin'
And every word out your mouth had my heart pipes burstin'
Knew from the jumble want it more than thirstin'
But didn't have a clue why a girl like you would want me

We blew that hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have been mistaken with
them statements that you make ‘cause

Ain't nobody dope as me
I'm dressed so fresh so clean (so fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think i'm so sexy
I'm dressed so fresh so clean (so fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me

I love when you stare at me
I'm dressed so fresh so clean (so fresh and so clean

So a nigga can ride out, to the Honeycomb Hideout

Ah ha, hush dat fuss

Do you wanna bump and slump wit us
We da type of people make da club get crunk
Ah ha, hush dat fuss

Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We taking another route to represent the Dungeon family
Like Great Day, me and and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin every city when we headed to that bat cave
A-T-L, Georgia, what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you soundin silly, thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doin doughnuts round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn, we the committee, gone burn it down

Okay, here we go

Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song
And I want y'all to sing along, sing along

See this is the way that we walk on a sunny, day
When it's rainin' inside
And you're, all alone, all alone, yeah

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)

And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)

Take a little trip, hater, pack up yo' mind
Look forward, not behind then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought, he could rhyme
Now, if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime

I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use
Abbreviation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck

See, ain't nuttin' changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what I'm forced to do

With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin'
Hair with stylin' gel in it, throw a curl in it

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I, Aquemini

Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on the bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping is a must
Is you on the that dust or cornstarch familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman how and the fuck you think we gon do that man
Riding around Old National on 18's without no gat man
Im strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fittin
But now we tappin the breaks from all of them corners that we be headin in a
Volkswagen and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't go get wood grain steering wheel
For real you can gon chill out and still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch

Thunder pounds, when I stomp the ground, wooh
Like a million elephants or silver back orang utangs
You can't stop the train, who wants some?

Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
The weatherman tellin' us it ain't gon' rain

So now we sittin' in a droptop, soakin' wet
In a silk suit tryin' not to sweat
Hittin' somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget, 1 9 9 9

Anno Domini, anything goes
Be what you want to be, long as you know
Consequences are given for living the fence is
Too high to jump in jail, too low to dig
I might just touch hell, hot

Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer.

Soul gold grill, and a baby mamma
Black Cadillac and a pack of pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS

Make a nigga want to stay on tour for days
Get back home, thangs are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before your left, adds up to a ball of power

Bitter be claimin' broke but I be sayin' they pro-cras-ti-natin'

Sink one in your chest and you is gone, up outta here for good

I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

So check me out, see once in a while when niggaz be tryin'
To test me I gets frisky grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but shit they missed me I'm gettin' nice
With them thangs, because I do like that you heard me on the radio
And yes my man I'm true to dat I run my lyrics the way

To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
Don't spend all your time tryin to get high

How will you make it if you never even try

I don't recall, ever graduatin at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asked to give me some livin life like a mofo
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
As act as though you know somethin I don't. Do you have any suggestions?
Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin
Sick of takin trash out and toilet bowl cleanin
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue travelin this route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here

Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
Around this bitch

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz

reminiscent of charles, a lil' disco-tech nestled in the ghettos
of niggaville, USA via Atlanta, georgia, a lil' spot where
young men and young women go to experience they first lil'
taste of nightlife, me? well, I've never been there, well perhaps once
but I was so engulfed in the "E"
I never made it to the door you speak of hard core
while the dj sweating out all the problems and troubles of the day
while this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors

chorus:
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git somethin
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
Don't spend all your time tryin to get high
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
Cuz you and I got to do for you and I

[Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduatin at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asked to give me some livin life like a mofo
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
As act as though you know somethin I don't. Do you have any suggestions?
Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin
Sick of takin trash out and toilet bowl cleanin
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue travelin this route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

Yea.
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the goodie, and the dungeon crew
Lets say her name was suzy skrew, cause she screwed a lot
Makin a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, im dickin the hoe down never said i paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like darth daver, made her
From college park and fayette, all the way down to decatur
Like jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a beamer eight-hundred-forty
Its foggy, i went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven oclock its gonna cost me
But i still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearin a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, i wanted to sex the hoe up
She said, lets hit the parking lot so i can sick your duck
I said, cool, i really wanted to cut you but thisll do.
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too.
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a lil will cd, and a fuckin poster
Its like that now
Its like that now, you better go on
And get, the hump, up out your back now
Its about four, or five, cats
Off in my llac now
We just, shoot, game in the
Form of story rap now (yeah)
Its like that now, its like that now
two: andre benjamin
Now suzy skrew had a partna named sasha (sasha), thumper (thumper)
I remember her number like the summer
When her and suzy yeah they threw a slumber - - party
But you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night

We chillin like a villain and a nigga feelin right

Humble as a mumble in the jungles

That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Humble as a mumble in the jungles

So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard, I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to

Trials and tribulations make you stronger, live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga? Start from ya corner
Everything don't always happen like you planned it
Demand it, over stand it then you handle it

Fuck wishing, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching, why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen?
Stop ya slipping and ya pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger

You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
No weapon formed against prospers 54: 17

In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net

Long as you know consequences are given for livin'

Too low to dig, I might just touch hell
HOT! Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer, soul gold grill and some baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of question with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe,

I never made it to the door you speak of hard core
while the dj sweating out all the problems and troubles of the day
while this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors

chorus:
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git somethin
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
Don't spend all your time tryin to get high
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin
Cuz you and I got to do for you and I

[Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduatin at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asked to give me some livin life like a mofo
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
As act as though you know somethin I don't. Do you have any suggestions?
Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin
Sick of takin trash out and toilet bowl cleanin
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue travelin this route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga round me playin' married
Or payin' child support

Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport

Pray I live to see the day when seven's happily married
With kids, woe woe

To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up

And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Trials and tribulations make you stronger, live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga? Start from ya corner
Everything don’t always happen like you planned it
Demand it, over stand it then you handle it

Fuck wishing, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching, why you quitting ’cause it’s heated in the kitchen?
Stop ya slipping and ya pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger

You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
No weapon formed against prospers 54: 17

Yeah
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian, want a description, my royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin' crickets and crows, bitches and hoes to queen things
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen things
like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
talkin' like that, man fuck them niggaz I'm goin' off
and comin' right back, like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems, Bankhead is better for em
When they can let they throw em, down from hitchikin' and bitin' niggas
until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend
like you Ms. Goodie, Four-Shoes, even Bo knew, that you got caught poked
like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas

just to see my senorita get her pillow

And your feelings you must protect 'em as well as your rectum!
Must keep self out of harm out of danger's way

Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail

You would be happy as hell! you thought you was happy
Until that court date came couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place family home is at stake

OK, I started out all alone
Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginnin to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm livin it through this song
A movin vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset!
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escapin me
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win

Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggaz that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered

Straight from the A-T

You know
We talk about it all day long baby
We fin'a break you off with some brand new shit

[C-Bone]
This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and had a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
She'll be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe

[Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop

Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high
(From this point on it only gets rougher)

Well here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly, like in 'Living Color"'s Wanda, word up
Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle
Or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort
So make it last for the risk you took
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels
And a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards

All you got in the refrigerator is Bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge

You got red dirt in your afro
Young Hov' in the place to be

Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block?
Didn't have to break a steerin' column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two shoes, that what they call ya
Never judge a person or a book by its covers
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself boi
Are you Black, White, Asian, Indonesian, or Borean?
That's Black and Korean

We on the same team if we breathin'
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seein'
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it 'cause they scared we gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power, the cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height
Because I might just snap on a fuck ass nigga
Might clap a cap at a sucka ass nigga

In the meantime, Daddy Fatsacks gon' chill out
He might just pull out his pistol
And let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kent, you better be way harder
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
Ain't no uno, we a duo, deuce dos to a pair

A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levis and toughskins, one minus one
Negative one minus negative one is nothin'
Bustin' D boy raps and player poems

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existance
We livin, breathin, soon we'll be teethin
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Donnel and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint

A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive

The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now

[Andre 3000 - Bridge]
A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive

You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
Sick my castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you
I've cast my spell on millions, but I'm terrified of you
Baby I do this from the ceiling, but I'm terrified of you

I'll wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened oh! Dracula's wedding

I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you
See my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you
I've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you

I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like "yeah, nigga right"
But you gave me you number anyway you were on the talcum
Powder, how's about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a mission impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page but in
The same book of life so I'd paged you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We starting hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking cool
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be
Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggaz in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?
Well, yes and no
Yes we were selling it
But no it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled "ho"
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Packed full of niggaz with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied see you later when he got the good news, that's life shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got glock and a low jack

Whether you like it or not, he's back

Sharp as a tack like I just left church, clean
Walk then attack when the shit won't work, mean
Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up

And everybody wanna know what's really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs? So on and so on
I can o-on and o-on
And on, and on, and on, hell yes!

Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes
Ya just don't know
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' â€~hey baby'

So baby please believe me
Don't you go

Better be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soaking wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
One-Nine-Nine-Nine, Anno Domini, anything goes, be whatchu wanna be
Long as you know consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell
HOT! Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer, soul gold grill and some baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of question with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe,

But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
As act as though you know somethin I don't. Do you have any suggestions?
Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin
Sick of takin trash out and toilet bowl cleanin
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue travelin this route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

Cool, movin' cool, movin' cool
Cool, movin' cool
Movin' cool, movin' cool, yeah
Aey, aey, hey, hey

I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way
But when I'm around you, you don't have too much to say
La, la, la, la, la, woo, woo

You see there will always be someone taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else, no

'Cause baby I am the opening act, the headliner
And the after party, after party, after party, after party, after party

I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody sees what I am but you, you

Well, it's the M I crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh Hell, there he go again talkin' that shit

Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spend

You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out you scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles

Daddy fat sacks, B I G B O I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin' the shout out to my Uncle Donnel locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit

Intro: Big Boi

Uhh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain, check it out

Verse One: Big Boi, Andre

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Pointe didn't have no doe
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walkin to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin, but now I lay it to the flo'
just like carpet, cuz I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cuz we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
activity, my soliloquoy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl

Caroline!
(Caroline!)
See, Caroline, all the guys would say she's mighty fine
(mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cussed out, or coming up short
Yeah, dig this now, even though
(even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide
(to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down-to-Mars girls, yeah

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo

Caroline!
(Caroline!)
I said see she's the reason for the word bitch
(bitch)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to some
Baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash, crash, crash... into a ditch
(Just playing)
She needs a golden calculator to divide
(to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down-to-Mars girls, yeah

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer
