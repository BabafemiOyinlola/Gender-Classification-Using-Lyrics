Yo, e to the x to the c-l-u
From the s to the I, baby, v-i-t-y
Exclusivity

To the e to the x to the c-l-u
From the s to the I, baby, v-i-t-y
Exclusivity

Now, dig

Baby, see you mean the world to me
And I refuse to be without your love
Love for me just like I love for you
And maybe we will be forever one

When I fall in love
Girl, I fall in love
You will be the only one
If you believe in love
Like I believe in love, baby
Girl, I want you, I want you

And when I feel the need
Girl, I feel the need
You will be the only one for me
I will be relieved that
You will be with me, baby

(CHORUS)
All I want from you
Is what you want from me
Ecxlusivity
And what you want from me
Is what I want from you
Baby, exclusivity

Baby, please
You are my everything
And how I long to be
Inside your world

Me for you
And, baby, you for me
Yes, I was meant to be
Your baby girl

Gotta learn my rhythmLyrictext

Gotta Learn My Rythm
If you don't want me why the hell won't you tell me so
Cause I don't wanna be around if you don't know
Give me a signal or a sign I'm not wasting my time
If we've got rythm then fine let's get it on

Slow down you're moving much too fast
Sure we've got rythm

Baby, if I drive you crazy
Ain't nothin' personal about it
Girl, I'm just that way
See, baby, sometimes I'm shaky
But don't confuse, it don't cha lose it
'Cause it be that way

Oh, here lately I been thinkin', just a thinkin'
Thinkin' whatcha think of your guy
Somebody's tellin' you I don't care about you
Ain't a single word about it true

[chrous]
When it gets right down to it
I'm in love with you

The arguing and disagreeing is finally behind us
Now we can go our separate ways so other loves can find us
So for now I must return this ring we thought would bind us
To walk away, I take a path that finds me on Virgin Island

Virgin Island
Just take a look at me
And you'll see why
Virgin Island
Most stubborn girls like me wind up on
Virgin Island
Ever since I set him free

No, I don't turn on
No, I won't turn off
Yes, I do relate
Still participate

Ain't gotta know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't gotta know what I'm sayin'
Ain't gotta know what the game is all about
But still you gotta know that you're playin'
We don't, we don't, we don't know the melody
We do, we do, we do know the song
There's a message in the music of the trumpet man

Trumpet man, trumpet man, trumpet man
Play us your song
All night
You know, you know, you know
The beat goes on
All night long

There's a funny phrase
Deep beneath the bass
Hidden in the sound
The trumpet man plays

All you need is a touch of the melody
All you need is the rhythm of the song
It could mean anything that you want it to
Ooh kay ya, ooh kay ya
You can sing with the band if you wanna sing
You can dance to the rhythm of the song
There's a message in the music of the trumpet man
Trumpet man, trumpet man, trumpet man
Play us your song
All night long (all night, all night)
You know, you know, you know
...
