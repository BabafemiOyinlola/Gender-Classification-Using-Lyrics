Let's talk again sometime, I notice you seem angry
Let's walk together and discuss why it has to be this way
Let's talk about each other, let's talk about our time
Let's talk bout the way things used to be fine
you know what? Let's not.
How about you just walk off and go hiome
How bout you take the high road and maybe I'll take the low
You're not coming back Icarus, we've never flown this high

Get up off your seat
Get up on your feet

You've been workin' all day long
Tryin' to make a dollar, uh huh
Workin' for a better way
And a brighter tomorrow
But all work, no play, ain't good, no no

Got to release sensuality
You've got to, you've got to

Had my heart in reaction
Ever since she walked through the door
Ooh yeah

Do most anything just to meet her
Tell me what's your name
I'd kind of like to get to know you

Girl in blue, I want you
Girl in blue, I wanna get next to you

Don't be afraid of the way u feel
It's real love Boy
Don't be afraid of the way u feel

I know it's not the first time
That you ever felt this way before
Ooh, but those memories are still lasting
Of the pain you got for your trusting
So when love calls u walk out the door oh, 
But this time, boy

Don't be afraid of the way you feel don't be afraid
Open your heart and you'll see it's real oh it's real love
It's real love
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
Oh don't be afraid now baby
It's real love

I'm not the one who hurt you, boy
And with love there's no real guarantee
If you believe in what you're feelin'
And you wanna make love to me, oh, baby
