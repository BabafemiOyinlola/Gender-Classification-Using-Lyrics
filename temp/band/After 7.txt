I was in love with you
And gave my heart to you
I did my best
To keep you satisfied

You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back
Your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine

I gave my world to you
But you said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done
To make you be so rough?

'Til you do me right
I don't even wanna talk to you
I don't even wanna hear
You speak my name

And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothin' good is gonna come
'Til you change, change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

I've been down and out but never this low before
And sometimes felt left out but never outside your door
We've been far apart but never this far, oh girl
I can't bridge the distance, baby, anymore

If you love me then just show me
But if you don't, then go on baby
With yourself and do what you wanna do with your life
And leave me alone

'Cause I'm cryin' for your lovin'
And I'm hopin' that this feelin' will die
But if it don't then girl, you've ruined my world
For the last time

I've got this damn thing called love
I've got it for ya but it just ain't enough
So I just watch my heart break
With every chance I take with you, with you

I'm out of my mind for love
Givin' you all just ain't enough
What am I supposed to do
To get with you, baby, lady, hey?

Yes, other girls have been good to me
But they never did the things you did for love
I guess you must have had to love me a lot
To spare the pain that you could rid me of

Wake up in the morning to our song
It's torture 'cause I left the radio on
Don't wanna turn it off reminiscing about you
I guess I'm gonna leave the damn thing on
'Cause it's sitting across the room

I've gotta spend my days working hard
To come home to myself
Trying to get you out of my mind, oh girl

Thinking of the things we used to do
I try to compensate for you
But nothing seems to work
Baby, can I ask you

How did he love you?
Does he want you?
Does he wake up in the night
Just to stare at you asleep?

Does he hold you?
Does he flaunt you?
Does he do it, do it
Like we did it back at home
At home, at home?

Just thinking about the way that we made love
Just layin' all day and squeezin' each other tight, yea
I miss those days, oh baby, would you bring them back
It's not right for me tonight, baby

How does it feel to know
You hurt someone so bad, now baby

Let's stretch out on my leather couch under our eighteen by twenty-two
I cannot try to explain it baby how can say it to you

Girl you're the rest of my life and all
And you come whenever I call
Girl I just wanna say it
I thank you from the bottom of my heart

That's why baby, what u r 2 me no one else can be
Ooh, and I think I'm in love baby
Ooh ooh, baby just can't stop this feeling from taking over and over
And I know I can't stop it girl, you're mine you're mine, yeah

Today I felt a pain inside my heart
The thought of leaving you was on my mind
If I've been deceiving you, it's all because I'm blind
'cause I care for you more than you know
Although my heart says go
Today I saw the tears inside your eyes
The thought of hurting you, I'd rather die
If I'm deserting you, I don't mean to make you cry
'cause I care for you more than you know
Although my heart says

How do you tell the one
You love goodbye for good

That I'd be losing sleep at night over you
Now I don't know what to do

I promised myself
That I would not cry over you
Now I feel it all inside

Thoughts of you
Keep driving me crazy
And if I don't sleep
Then it won't even faze me

Some people call it love
I call it sprung on you

Here we go, here we go
I'm coming again
You got me messed up, baby
I'm sprung on it

And that things have changed
'Cause girl I sit by the phone and I wait for your call
But the phone never rings

So I picked up the phone and called you at home
You're on the other line
I wanna talk to you maybe even see you
You say you have no time

You started doing things
That you never did before
How could something so right turn out
To be something so wrong

You thought the grass was greener
You thought the well had water
You thought that you could find a love another place, oh
And how could you, how could you leave this good thing?

We use to take long walks and have long, long talks

I've never been that kinda man
I must admit it, I wasn't with it
But you were the best I've ever had

Right now I'm going through some changes
I've always thought I was a faithful kind of man
I never thought I would be tempted
Baby, you licked my lips and I said, "Right now, right now"

I'll give you the sun, the rain, the moon, the stars and the mountains
I'll give you the world and all that you wish for
And even more
Girl I'll love you more than you could know
And that's for sure
I'd climb the highest hill, cross the widest sea
Nothin' could discourage me
And I pray that you'll be always there for me
Forevermore (Hoooo oh)
Ready or not
I'll give you everything and more
All that I've got is yours
I'll give you everything
All that you're looking for
I'll give you my heart, my soul, my time my love is a fountain

I will be your earth
Ooooh and all that you need for and even more
'Cause girl I love you more than words can show
My love is pure
I, I'll walk a thousand miles, sail a thousand seas

Babyface and L.A. Reid

Last night, I had the time of my life--
it's true
For last night, I made love for the very
first time
With you

I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you made the difference
Now love is so clear

And I can't stop (Can't stop)**
How I feel
...

There comes a time in every man's life
You're gonna do wrong
I made a mistake girl
Just let me, just let me explain

I can't believe it, although I did it
I've never been that kinda man
I must admit it, I wasn't with it
But you were the best I've ever had

Right now I'm going through some changes
I've always thought I was a faithful kind of man
I never thought I would be tempted
Baby, you licked my lips and I said, "Right now, right now"

In the heat of the moment
Baby I lost my head, lost my mind, didn't know what to do
In the heat of the moment
Baby, I fell in lust with you
I lost my head, lost my mind

You've got that look in your eyes
And I've got plans for two
Though you're the kinda girl
Who likes to take her time with love
I'd gladly wait forever for you

But in the middle of the night
I know something ain't right
We've got something special girl
Let's give it a try

One night of touchin'
Two nights of trust
Three nights of huggin'
Makes one night of love

One night of touchin'
Two nights of trust
Three nights of huggin'
Makes one night of love

Baby, baby, you don't understand
How much I love you, baby
How much I wanna be your only man
And baby, baby, baby, you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer, I wanna talk to you just a little more
I see the little tears in your eyes, about to fall
You are wondering if I'm for real
But if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you no lie, this how I feel
Oh, baby I'm for real
Do do do do do do

I was in love with you
And gave my heart to you
I did my best
To keep you satisfied

You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back
Your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine

I gave my world to you
But you said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done
To make you be so rough?

'Til you do me right
I don't even wanna talk to you
I don't even wanna hear
You speak my name

And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothin' good is gonna come
'Til you change, change your ways
Until you change your evil ways
