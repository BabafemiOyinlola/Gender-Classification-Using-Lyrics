Baby, what's your phone number?
I know I'm kinda fast, but I hate to waste time.
Baby, what's your phone number?
Girl, I have to ask cuz you're so fine.

777-9311 - I wanna spend the night with you if that's alright.
777-9311 - Ooh baby, please can I come tonight?

Baby, what's your phone number?
How can you be reached on a lonely night?
Baby, what's your phone number?
How can I get into you when I'm feeling right?

777-9311 - I wanna spend the night with you if that's alright.
777-9311 - Ooh baby, please can I come tonight?

One day I'm gonna be somebody, one day I'm gonna be rich.
I'm gonna say my prayers and work real hard, so that I never have to dig a ditch.
The only way I'd work at a carwash, is if I owned the whole damn place.
But if gettin' to the top means washin' a car, I'd be scrubbin' with a smile on my face.

One day I'm gonna be somebody, gonna stand out in a crowd.

Attention everybody! I'm gonna show you a brand new dance.
It's called "The walk, the walk", just let your body talk 'til you're deep in a trance.
You don't need no partner, you can walk all alone.
Whenever you feel the groove just let your body move, walkin' to a beat of your own.

(chorus)
Everybody walk your body, everybody walk.
Everybody walk your body, everybody walk.

Attention everybody! I said it ain't hard to do.
Just walk, walk, let your body talk, walkin' so cool.
Attention everybody! I said I just shined my shoes.
So you can let your body talk, just watch where you walk or your life you're gonna lose.
In other words, I'll walk you 'til you're dead.

(repeat chorus)

The days of dancing in one place are gone.
And honey, you know you can't dance with them tight jeans on.
If you try to cop a dip, you trip, slip, and fall.
Walking's for the cool baby, put on a camisole.

(repeat chorus)

Who? Me? I wear baggies, zip, snap, and drop.
Easy access baby. Yes, before you get a chance to holler "Stop!"
Besides, Rollo likes his freedom.
Ain't nothin' like a fresh pair of baggies.
Now I know that's right

(repeat chorus)

I guess you've heard of my reputation, I've had my share of foolin' around.
But everybody needs stimulation, and mine just happens to be all over town.
It's an easy-money occupation, a first-class psychiatry.
But just once, I'd wanna make love without taking off my clothes.
Just once, I wanna make love with somebody who really and truly knows:

Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too.
All my lovers need stimulation, but honey babe, I think that I need you.

Maybe you're the kind of person, that could turn my world around.
Won't you gimme little inspiration? Maybe that's what I need to make me settle down.
It's an easy-money occupation, but honey one thing understand.

Don't wait for me
(I'll just make love to you girl)
Then set you free

I'm just a young man
What makes you think that I have the time oh oh
2 be falling in love in my prime

You think I'm afraid of how it would be

Don't take it personal girl
Still on your side no

If I see somethin' that I like, it's a, I have to go for it
And I like what I see, baby, ah, come here

I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone

I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek

She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, "How much money you make?"

Leave your number on the table by my data bank

If I see somethin' that I like, it's a, I have to go for it
And I like what I see, baby, ah, come here

I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company
That's right

And you know that I'm talkin' about the

So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone

I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek

Hey, are y'all ready to party up in here?
I said are you ready to party up in here?
Then I want you to put yo' hands together.
Come on, put yo' hands together and stomp yo' feet.
And welcome to the stage Donnie Simpson.
Come on y'all, bring it up. Make some noise!

Alright, how y'all doin' tonight?
Well, Popeye already asked if you ready to party and obviously you are.
I can't hear you, are you ready to party?
Alright, I am so honored to be here to night.
I've M.C.'d a lot of shows in my time.
But a... this one is the most special ever.
Because it gives me an opportunity to bring some guys together that I love.
I mean they're like brothers to me. They really are.

Lots of burnin' drawers in here, gotta get me some.
Let me make up my mind, I gotta pick me one.
Here's another comin' now, it's a mass hysteria.

Wild chaotic, peak of my erotic. There's a riot goin' on.
People manic, dancin' in a panic. We call it pandemonium.

Body of a superstar, the mind of a 10-year-old.
She wants to take you for a ride, the stella has hair of gold.
The lights are on upstairs, but is anybody home?
She's not lookin' for a man, the girly wants to be alone.

She's the queen of glamorous, everything is right.
All the fellas have a fit, anytime she walks by.
This woman would be dangerous, if she had a mind.
When Blondie tells you what you want to hear, don't waste your time.

(chorus)
And her name is Blondie, sexy socialite. - Dumb blonde.
Diggin' out on the town any given night.
And her name is Blondie, the queen of glamorous.
And the game is money, the girl is dangerous.

Blondie was a victim to everything she liked.
She likes money, fine clothes and fancy cars, but her name she could not write.
Blondie is a certain type, she's not yellow, black or white.
But you can find her out diggin' in the finer spots on any given night.

Her fatal beauty's blinding and her intentions not kind.
She tried to take a part of me, but I caught on in time.
She lives a life of make believe, takes what she wants and leaves.
Blondes, they do have more fun, but how dumb is she?

Jerk out, got to make some love tonight

Jerk it, jerk it, I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it, jerk out
Jerk it, jerk it, I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it, jerk out

I took her to my crib and I laid her down
Her body felt kinda right
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell
I figured that was what she liked

I said, "Baby, don't get too comfortable
'Cuz I really like to sleep alone
Leave your number on the table by my data bank
I love you, but you got to go"
"What?"

Jerk out, "You ain't got to go home
But you got to get the hell outta here"
Jerkin' everything in sight, I'm talkin' about the
Jerk out, got to make some love tonight, all night

Jerk out, " What's your number girl?"
Jerkin' everything in sight, in sight, the master of the
Jerk out, got to make some love tonight
Oh, I got to make some love

Jerk it, jerk it, jerk out

Uh, I don't know it's, it's just a thing with me you know
If I see somethin' that I like, it's a, I have to go for it
And I like what I see, baby, ah, come here

I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company
That's right

Jerk out, jerkin' everything in sight
And you know that I'm talkin' about the
Jerk out, I got the cash, I got the ride, oh, Lord
Got to make some love tonight
And you know I got the look

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone

I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, "How much money you make?"
Let's just say it'll be more money
Than you'll ever see in your lifetime

Jerk out
Jerkin' everything in sight, I'm talkin' about the
Jerk out, got to make some love tonight

Jerk it, jerk it, I'm talkin' about the

Baby, what's your phone number?
I know I'm kinda fast, but I hate to waste time.
Baby, what's your phone number?
Girl, I have to ask cuz you're so fine.

777-9311 - I wanna spend the night with you if that's alright.
777-9311 - Ooh baby, please can I come tonight?

Baby, what's your phone number?
How can you be reached on a lonely night?
Baby, what's your phone number?
How can I get into you when I'm feeling right?

One day I'm gonna be somebody, one day I'm gonna be rich.
I'm gonna say my prayers and work real hard, so that I never have to dig a ditch.
The only way I'd work at a carwash, is if I owned the whole damn place.
But if gettin' to the top means washin' a car, I'd be scrubbin' with a smile on my face.

One day I'm gonna be somebody, gonna stand out in a crowd.

Attention everybody! I'm gonna show you a brand new dance.
It's called "The walk, the walk", just let your body talk 'til you're deep in a trance.
You don't need no partner, you can walk all alone.
Whenever you feel the groove just let your body move, walkin' to a beat of your own.

(chorus)
Everybody walk your body, everybody walk.
Everybody walk your body, everybody walk.

Attention everybody! I said it ain't hard to do.
Just walk, walk, let your body talk, walkin' so cool.
Attention everybody! I said I just shined my shoes.
So you can let your body talk, just watch where you walk or your life you're gonna lose.
In other words, I'll walk you 'til you're dead.

(repeat chorus)

The days of dancing in one place are gone.
And honey, you know you can't dance with them tight jeans on.
If you try to cop a dip, you trip, slip, and fall.
Walking's for the cool baby, put on a camisole.

(repeat chorus)

Who? Me? I wear baggies, zip, snap, and drop.
Easy access baby. Yes, before you get a chance to holler "Stop!"
Besides, Rollo likes his freedom.
Ain't nothin' like a fresh pair of baggies.
Now I know that's right

(repeat chorus)

I guess you've heard of my reputation, I've had my share of foolin' around.
But everybody needs stimulation, and mine just happens to be all over town.
It's an easy-money occupation, a first-class psychiatry.
But just once, I'd wanna make love without taking off my clothes.
Just once, I wanna make love with somebody who really and truly knows:

Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too.
All my lovers need stimulation, but honey babe, I think that I need you.

Maybe you're the kind of person, that could turn my world around.
Won't you gimme little inspiration? Maybe that's what I need to make me settle down.
It's an easy-money occupation, but honey one thing understand.

You think that you in love with me
I think you're beautiful and should be free
I'M JUST A YOUNG MAN GOT LOTS OF TIME
Right now that kind of thing isn't on my mind

Don't wait for me
(I'll just make love to you girl)
Then set you free

I'm just a young man
What makes you think that I have the time oh oh
2 be falling in love in my prime

You think I'm afraid of how it would be
Might be too cautious girl don't blame me
Time after time again baby I tried
Don't take it personal girl
Still on your side no

Don't wait for me

We are young, we are free on earth together. Let's fall in love.
You are fine, you are white, I am of color. Let's fall in love.

Ice cream castles in the summertime.
Ice cream castles in the summer.

I want you, you want me, we want each other. Is that so wrong?
It's raining. Mad sisters, why can't they realize, that it won't be long?

We're all ice cream castles in the summertime.
Ice cream castles in the summer.
Let's do something soon.

We are young, we are free. Let's come together before the end.

Baby, when we go out, I got clout
'Cuz I'm your number one body rocker
Fellas, she'll make you scream, your insides shout

But let me tell you what it's all about

She's mine, all mine
I'm her number one body rocker all of the time

But let me

Baby, I'm so ashamed, 'cuz I'm all aflame
I mean you've got my body hot
Fellas, she's so fast, you'd never last
 (Yeah)
You couldn't deal with the funk she's got

She's mine, all mine

You like my crib, baby?
Well, come a little closer. Don't be shy.

Darlin', I want you so bad. I can almost taste the smell of your skin.
And honey, I'd be so sad, if you didn't break down and let me in.
You better let me in, baby. Don't you know ...

If the Kid can't make you come, nobody can.

Am I gettin' through, baby?

Sweetheart, I can be gentle as a lamb. If that's what gets you off.
I wanna get you off, baby.
And lover, straddle my brass and we'll dance in the land of the hard and soft.
I don't care, baby. Whatever gets you off?

If the kid can't make you come, nobody can.

Need I say more, baby?
Do you wanna straddle my brass?

If the kid can't make you come, nobody ...

What time is it?
Alright, y'all got 10 seconds to get to the dance floor.
Whawk!
C'mon now...

America, have you heard? I got a brand new dance and it's called "The bird"
You don't need no finesse or no personality, you just need two arms and an attitude.
And everybody sing with me, come on now!

Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa!

Brothers, don't be cool. Women like it sometimes when you act a fool.
Sisters, don't be shy. Let your body get loose, you ain't too fat to fly.
Come on now! Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa!

Yes! Hold on now, this dance ain't for everybody. Just the sexy people.
White folks, you're much too tight.
You gotta shake your head like the black folks. You might get some tonight.
Look out!
