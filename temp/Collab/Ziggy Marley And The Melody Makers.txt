Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Tomorrow people, where is your past?

Today you say you deyah
Tomorrow you say you're gone
But you're gone so long
If there is no love in your heart - so sorry
Then there is no hope for you - true, true

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?

It's kozmik, it's kozmik

I know there are many forces that would not like to see
Our dreams become reality
There's a war going on, a war you cannot see
Right versus wrong, it's a war that is so real

I wake up in the morning and the sun I didn't see
But I feel the vibes, forces around me
Can you feel it? It's kozmik, I can feel it, hey, can you feel it?
It's kozmik man, kozmik, kozmik, kozmik live in me

It's kozmik

Innocent fallen victim, although they can't explain
Intellect takes advantage of the simple man

Get those problems out your head
Put your mama to bed
But don't stray too far from reality
Or you will live in a dream world

Dreaming of things that there ain't no possibility, who
Wee, believe me
Let's have a nice grooving time, but don't go too far
From the truth in your mind

'Cause you'll drink and drive
And then you'll fly too
High and so you'll pay the price
For justa feeling nice

Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime

So many things to foresee
We were not born to live this way
We were born having fun in the jungle of grace
With plenty of food to eat and plenty drink to drink

So you know what I mean when I say
Liberate yourself from the state that you're in
It stink, it stink, it stink

Mi sey to dance if you have to
But don't take no chance

That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,
Marching down freedom's road.
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,
From marching down freedom's road.

Hand me my gun, let the bugle blow loud,
I'm on my way with my head a-proud,
One objective I've got in view,
Is to keep a hold of freedom for me and you
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,
Marching down freedom's road.
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,

There's a war going on, a war you cannot see
Right versus wrong, it's a war that is so real

But I feel the vibes, forces around me

Let's have a goodtime
Though the world is cruel and blind

Get those problems out your head
Put your mama to bed
But don't stray too far from reality
Or you will live in a dream world

Dreaming of things that there ain't no possibility, who
Wee, believe me
Let's have a nice grooving time, but don't go too far
From the truth in your mind

'Cause you'll drink and drive
And then you'll fly too
High and so you'll pay the price
For justa feeling nice

Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime

So many things to foresee
We were not born to live this way
We were born having fun in the jungle of grace
With plenty of food to eat and plenty drink to drink

So you know what I mean when I say
Liberate yourself from the state that you're in
It stink, it stink, it stink

Mi sey to dance if you have to
But don't take no chance

Put your mama to bed
But don't stray too far from reality
Or you will live in a dream world

Dreaming of things that there ain't no possibility, who
Wee, believe me
Let's have a nice grooving time, but don't go too far
From the truth in your mind

'Cause you'll drink and drive
And then you'll fly too
High and so you'll pay the price
For justa feeling nice

Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime

So many things to foresee
We were not born to live this way
We were born having fun in the jungle of grace
With plenty of food to eat and plenty drink to drink

So you know what I mean when I say
Liberate yourself from the state that you're in
It stink, it stink, it stink

But don't take no chance

Put the guns down, meet me at a show
Zee get open, you can let that go
Chill, keep it real, you been had your deal
I'm still gonna be the first one to reach a mil
Best do the drop kick, skills loop the trumpet
My tape going platinum and be on some dumb shit
Many crews stepped up to get hurt
With blood from they mouth on my Polo shirt
We got cases and don't need new beef
But a nigga pop shit and get a quick two piece
So tell who souped you, no brain get crucial
Do the unusual that y'all not used to
Put the Rock in the Box and my crew gets the job done
Believe me, you don't want no problems

Let's have a goodtime
Though the world is cruel and blind

Get those problems out your head
Put your mama to bed
But don't stray too far from reality
Or you will live in a dream world

Dreaming of things that there ain't no possibility, who
Wee, believe me
Let's have a nice grooving time, but don't go too far
From the truth in your mind

'Cause you'll drink and drive
And then you'll fly too
High and so you'll pay the price
For justa feeling nice

Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a goodtime

So many things to foresee
We were not born to live this way
We were born having fun in the jungle of grace
With plenty of food to eat and plenty drink to drink

So you know what I mean when I say
Liberate yourself from the state that you're in
It stink, it stink, it stink

Mi sey to dance if you have to
But don't take no chance

Uh, let me ask you somethin'

Say people, are you ready?
Are you ready to get together
To get together?

But first, well, there's just one thing
We've, we've got to do
You know, we've got to do

Well, first let's set all people free
First let's set all, no matter color or creed
No matter if a mixed breed

Say people, ay, are you ready?
Ah, could you, could you
Tell me if you're ready
To stand up and fight?

Oh, fight for your rights, we're gonna fight for our rights

Reggae is now
Reggae's got a feeling
Reggae is now
Reggae's got a meaning

You think reggae will be reggae, yeah
Tough reggae, we're doin' okay, yeah
More reggae is good reggae
Rock reggae man, you're doin' okay, yeah

Reggae is now
Reggae's got a feeling
Reggae is now
Reggae's got a meaning

Running through the woods of Africa, yeah
The lies are demolished
Running through the woods of Ethiopia
The lies are demolished
