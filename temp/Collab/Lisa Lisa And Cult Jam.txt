Take me home, Take me home

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Cause I'm not to sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end up hurt
Oh I don't know...

That's the way that I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I wonder if I take you home would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home would you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight

Your love is... take me home

Lately you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch
You say I'm teasing but ought to have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
Cause you will have me and sooner than you know it
If you could only wait
Oh I dont know...

Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through the dark
Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through the dark
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart
That beat in my heart

After all that we've been through
I can't seem to face the fact that boy I'm losing you
I threw away your ties through those venetian blinds
I looked and saw my heart just over ruled my mind

And I tried not to let it show now I don't know what to do
I tell myself I'm lying so let's just not let it go
My heart does double beats for you, oh

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love

Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through the dark
Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through the dark
Can't you see that you must be a part

You always would take me for granted
Somehow I always lose

The love that we had together
You still mean something, oh, baby
But now that time has been changin?
Your feelings have disappeared

There's no way
We'll make it together, (My darling, my darling)
Times have changed

You won't change

You'll never change
I'm never happy, I'm never happy
Oh, baby, change
You'll never change, I just know that you'll stay the same

All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you, don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain

As friends we were so, so tight
Can’t help myself, you make me feel so right
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin’

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I think I love you

This is the best that you gave because stars aren't allowed to get lonely
My heart screams look past my frame, I'm in need of some laughter
Oh, please let me live in your world I hope that eyes can see
That I need someone to love me for me, me
So you ask yourself oh, this feeling is it true from the heart
Was it my fame and glory why the stars in your eyes wrote the story
And if I want satisfaction, I can have anyone that I see
But why should I settle for less wen I need you to love me for me
Oh, so confused, is this real, do you love me
Give me the feeling you care endlessly, my love

You touched me gentle, made me feel tender
Had to surrender unto you and let you enter

When you love me down you just blow my mind, yeah

You and me equals love

You make me feel complete, you're sweet, never demanding
So happy that I found a lover
Who's my friend until the end, I don't need no other

Sekarang sang pianis hujan
Sedang melantunkan asmara
Ditengah kota pun dia mainkan melody yang sedih
Jemari tetesan air
Menekan window di keyboardnya
Concerto yang hanya untukku

Dengan kata-kata lembut
Kau putuskan sayonara
Terlalu tiba-tiba
Di pinggiran sofa aku
Hanya duduk dan terdiam
Menggigit kuku jemariku

"Ku yakin akan ada yang lebih baik untukmu"
Tatapanmu seperti melihat anak kecil
Terulang kembali takdir masa depanku
Yang selalu membuatku takut
...

Rock the house, y'all
Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round and round

Head to toe
I know

Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known

Who would have thought that we would become lovers
As friends we were so, so tight
Can’t help myself, you make me feel so right
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin’

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe
I know

Here today, gone tomorrow
It’s possible, but I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

Take me home, Take me home

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Cause I'm not to sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end up hurt
Oh I don't know...

That's the way that I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I wonder if I take you home would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home would you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight

Your love is... take me home

Lately you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch
You say I'm teasing but ought to have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
Cause you will have me and sooner than you know it
If you could only wait
Oh I dont know...

From day one I knew that we would be happy forever
And that's a long, long time
And what we have is something special
No thought we'd ever still be together

All the love we make
All the feelings you gave me
Whenever you're lonely
You can be sure of one thing

I'll be there when you need me
You can count on me to kiss your tears away
Night and day
Take my hand, come and play with me
Oh I'll be there
Just as long as you believe in me

Hit the beat now
Lost in emotion
Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting
My dreams have yet begun

Oh baby
Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
And is my love for you? Oh I
Can't conceal, oh

I'm lost in emotion

Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby I'm
Lost in emotion

Am I a fool? At least my friends think so
Que-sera, que-sera
Baby
Whatever will be
Que-sera, que-sera

Between you and me
Just how true are the rumors I am hearing
About the crash you have on me

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart? That beat in my heart

After all that we've been through
I can't seem to face the fact that boy I'm losing you
I threw away your ties through those venetian blinds
I looked and saw my heart just over ruled my mind

And I tried not to let it show now I don't know what to do
I tell myself I'm lying so let's just not let it go
My heart does double beats for you, oh

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?

Oh, Little Jackie
Alright

Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star

She got off a Greyhound in search of fortune and fame
Hopin to find a better way and leave her troubles behind
But little did she know that life was sometimes touch and go
Some never get it, open your eyes or you'll learn to regret it

Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's caught in the middle -- Of reality and what she's dreamin of
Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
Smack dab in the middle of -- Oh, growin up

Times Square Is there where she makes it
Some people never get there
Then she met a guy -- So fine -- but he wants to buy nothin but a $5 high
Jackie say no -- Hell try to change ya -- or rearrange you

Yea ya look good?
but can ya cook good?
Can ya read
or is ya brain like wood?
Do ya have sex
or do ya make love
How do you live?
Do you give or do you take love?
Girl you so fine
Could you be mine
Or do i slack in the back of a w-w-wack line?
Yea the food look right but that (aint my type of hype, yea right)
(Full Force)
Act your age
(Act your age)
Not the size of those pants you wear, so tight
You look ripe
But yea yet everywhere ya walk around
With ya head up in the sky
Oh why ya wanna mess around with so many guys
(girl) We used to have (fun)
I'd thought you'd be the one
To be by my side
But oh oh oh ohh i was wrong
I thought your love was strong
But it's so weak that i cannot compete
Girl your such a freak, oh ohh oh
Your love's so good
(Your love's so good)
It aint my type of hype baby
Me and you were crazy good

In the place to be

Girl, I want to shower you with diamonds and pearls
And when we're all alone I take you for a trip around the world
Yes, indeed I like your stile, oooh, you're worth my while
Baby, I'm your carpenter, please let me lay your tile

I don't wanna share you with no-one else
Alice, be my girl

Can't you see?
I want you just for me
Can't you see?
I want you just for me

Full Force get busy one time

After school can I please take you the picture show?
Of the ladies that are after me you're the only one I want to know, aha
I can't wait 'till after school, it's hard to keep cool
Meet me on the staircase, girl, let's break the golden rule

The limousine is waitin'
Please drive me up the one and don't let go

All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you, don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
