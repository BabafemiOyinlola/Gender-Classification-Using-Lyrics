Left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so low,
Where only fools go
I sthe angel in you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do!

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

Can you love me again?

I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it

Out of my head to say the things I said
I didn't mean a word
Think jealousy just took a hold of me
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard
(No doubt about it) My heart is in her hands
(With every moment) I'm waiting for a second chance
(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see
I can't face the world if she don't love me

I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
When I walked away I cried (cried)
And I really didn't mean it
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)

Oh, oh, oh, oh -
It must have been cold there in my shadow,
to never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way.
You always walked a step behind.

Here comes the mailman walking up the street
and it looks like he has a letter today for me
Wait a minute let me look inside no it couldn't be from my guy
because he he brought me, (yes he did)
I said he he brought me, (yes he did)
A letter full of tears
I thought we had a love so strong (we had a love)
it would take a lifetime to break us apart
oh yes

Givin' up is hard to do
When you really love someone
Givin' up is hard to do
When you still depend upon

His warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
That used to mean so much
And bring you happiness

(Givin' up) Oh, Lord, is hard to do
I try, but it's just no use
(Givin' up) Whoa, Lord, it's hard to do

He said he's going back to find
(Going back to find)
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind not so long ago

He's leaving
(Leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia, yeah
(Leaving on the midnight train)
Said he's going back
(Going back to find)
To a simpler place and time, oh yes he is
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)
I'll be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world
(Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

He kept dreaming
(Dreaming)
Ooh, that some day he'd be a star
(A superstar, but he didn't get far)

Here comes the mailman walking up the street
and it looks like he has a letter today for me
Wait a minute let me look inside no it couldn't be from my guy
because he he brought me, (yes he did)
I said he he brought me, (yes he did)
A letter full of tears
I thought we had a love so strong (we had a love)
it would take a lifetime to break us apart
oh yes

L.A. proved too much for the man
(Too much for the man, he couldn't make it)
So he's leaving a life he's come to know, ooh
(He said he's going)
He said he's going back to find
(Going back to find)
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind not so long ago

He's leaving
(Leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia, yeah
(Leaving on the midnight train)
Said he's going back
(Going back to find)
To a simpler place and time, oh yes he is
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)
I'll be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world
(Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

He kept dreaming
(Dreaming)
Ooh, that some day he'd be a star
(A superstar, but he didn't get far)

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons to keep on, keepin' on
Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day, I woke up and found that you were gone

Darkness all around me, blackin out the sun
Old friends call me but I just don't feel like talkin to anyone
Emptiness has found me and it just won't let me go
I go right on livin' baby, but why I just don't know

You're so strong

Ooh, you'll be there between each line of pain and glory

I can't face the world if she don't love me

I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
When I walked away I cried (cried)
And I really didn't mean it
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons to keep on, keepin' on
Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day, I woke up and found that you were gone

Darkness all around me, blackin out the sun
Old friends call me but I just don't feel like talkin to anyone
Emptiness has found me and it just won't let me go
I go right on livin' baby, but why I just don't know

You're so strong

For whatever reason there might be

(And you make me realize my needs)
We seem to move in the right direction

Makin' love, makin' love

Oh, please

Here we go
On and on
On and on
On and on

On and on
On and on
We gotta go

Keep on movin'
On and on
On and on

How can I
How can I show you how
I want, now, prove all love
But I'm so afraid
To take a part
Don't break my heart
The way so many lovers do

So good I feel
'Cause our love's for real
Having tons of fun
Since our love's begun

Huggin' and a-lovin'

Gladys Knight & The Pips

Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you I'll never know
You found a reason for leavin'
Soon as I gave my love to you

And oh... ah... whoa... the pain you put me through
You don't care? bout my love for you, huh
But I found a reason for livin'
And I'm through with cryin' over you

And now I feel a song in my heart again
I knew as soon as I felt him lookin' through me
I feel a song in my heart again
High on the wings of the things he's doin' to me

We've come a long way from nowhere
The road was often paved with tears and pain
Whenever I got lost you were always there
Through it all you never once complained

There were times I know you thought
The sun would never find us
Sometimes I felt that same way too
Now it looks as if all the hard times are behind us
One by one our dreams are coming true
 (One by one, one by one)

Love finds its own way

Burning a secret flame
Meeting in shadows, ignoring the signs
That were loving on a borrowed time
How sweet the memory lingers on

You see a lifetime of dreams
Scattered in the wind

Together
We belong together

Come and walk with me
We can go where peaceful waters flow

If loneliness surrounds you
And rain clouds always hang around you
And wakin up each day gets you down
And if the life that you're leading
Seems hollow, then maybe what you're needing
Is someone to turn your world around

Come take my hand and walk with me
Let me teach you how to smile Let me teach you how to smile

Hey, you know, everybody's talkin' about the good old days, right
Everybody, the good old days, the good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days
Come to think of it as, as bad as we think they are
these will become the good old days for our children, hum
Why don't we, ah

Try to remember that kind of September, when
When life was slow and oh, so mellow, hum
Try to remember, and if you remember then follow

Oh, why does it seem the past is always better
We look back and think
The winters were warmer
The grass was greener
The skies were bluer

Ohhhh, Ohhhh,
Operator, are you sure
That line is busy all this time
Won't you please dial the numer
Operater, dial the number
I've got to reach that baby of mine

I've got to tell him that I'm sorry
For the things I've said
Sorry as I can be

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me now

Before you go
There is one thing I like to know
May tomorrow be sunny and bright

Mmmmm
Here comes the mailman walking up the street
and it looks like he has a letter today for me
Wait a minute let me look inside no it couldn't be from my guy
because he he brought me, (yes he did)
I said he he brought me, (yes he did)
A letter full of tears
I thought we had a love so strong (we had a love)
it would take a lifetime to break us apart
oh yes
