{This goes out to all of those that were lost in Virginia Parents, families, friends, we light a candle And let you know that Virginia will rise again}  I know you're feeling pain right now And you don't wanna talk right now I know you're going through something And you don't wanna be bothered right now  Not gonna lie and say I understand I just wanna be here for you if I can To hold your hand and be by your side And together we will get through these times  And we will cry together And we'll fight this together And we'll be strong together Stand together, pray together  Rise up, when you feel you can't go on Rise up, when all of your hope is gone Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong Rise up  Rise up, and when the tears start to fall Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all Rise up, when your back is up against the wall Rise, rise up  Now I know the burdens that you've had And you don't think nobody cares A storm comes out of nowhere And you're feeling like it just ain't fair ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
First of all you gotta understand This album is not about me tryin’ to show somebody I can do reggae music or I’m reggae or anythin' like that This song’s about reachin' the masses, you know what I’m sayin’?  As a matter of fact that whole MV project, is really about It’s not about R. Kelly shinin’ It’s really about me shinin' light on my people In Jamaica with my music ‘cause I got fans there An' they love me, you know what I mean?  Don’t like confrontation Don’t like inconsideration Don’t like false accusations Can’t stand victimization  Don’t like starvation Oh, I never liked discrimination It’s not all about separation It’s about healin' the nations  (I like love) I’m all about that thing called love Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love (I like love) I’m all about that thing called love Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love  (I like love) I’m all about that thing called love Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
