Just Be My Lady

Just Be My Lady
I will love you every day and night
Just Be My Lady
I promise you everything will be alright
Just Be My Lady
that's really what you alto do
Just Be My Lady
this love I have was meant for you
Just Be My Lady

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Love had played its games on me so long
I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in, said, "You can't win"
But one day the sun came a shinin· through
The rain had stopped and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was saying "I love you" to me

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
People ask me everywhere
"Is that really all your hair?"
I just tell 'em, "If it ain't
Then it sure don't mean
That now I can't"

I just don't believe it's fair
To judge a girl by the length of her hair

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Is it love that I feel
I've just got to know myself
Is it real

What i'm feeling inside
It must be love
because my nose is open wide

Some people just don't know
Quite how love feels
But when it makes you act like this
Oo wee baby, it's real

I've always wanted someone
Just like you

...

Sooner or later
I'm gonna get next to you
ooh sooner or later

Having you here in my life
Makes up for all the things that I never had
Girl you make me feel so happy
I just can't tell you how I feel
You stay constantly on my mind
Only one thought and that one is about you
I just keep on loving you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your place

Love
No one can live without it
Love
And there ain't nobody doubting
Stand up and shout about love
Love, love, love, love

In my arms is where you belong
You are my music, you are my song
From the first time I laid eyes on you
From then on, my life, I made a part of you
I'm gonna give you my everything
