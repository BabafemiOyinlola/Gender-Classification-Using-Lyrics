Oh Kay (Get down now)
Big dawg now one shot deal shit

Yea, OK
Now I'm in the spot where I want to be
Money spent, niggas gettin bent, chicks in front of me
Just the way I like it, hunnies turnin' somethin'
I got a seat up in the cut and I'm burnin' somethin'
Booties dancin' 'round a nigga and I'm killin' one
Killin' one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table, I'm fuckin with this chick,
with a phat body and the ring up in her navel
Dances around, she struts with the "fuck" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk
Do whatcha gotta do, I ain't mad at 'chu
Know a lot of haters when they seen and as bad as you
You's a real bad girl, a nigga need that
Sippin' on ya Henny, askin' where the weed at
Lemme put you onto somethin'
You fuckin' with a big nigga, no frontin'

[Chorus: x2]
Uh shorty, turn it around lemme see somethin'
Fuckin' with me for real, it's gone be somethin'
Yea, I'm talkin' lights, camera, action
Had me singin' "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"

You know my cousin D2, yea that's my peop-le

Live alone, got a style all your own

Ooohhh...

Ok, yeah, yeah hey yo

Friday night, just got paid
I'm runnin wit my mans we got plans of gettin laid up
Sticky green burnin sittin on twenty's
Pocket full of money and we hollerin the honeys yo
Stress less of death and we let the chain swing
Makin??? we out for the same thing
Hittin up the spot where they say is jumpin at
I'm straight?? and man I'm bringin somethin back
Me and the wild one we just copped a nice one
And two brand new toys fuck the price done
Big nigga style say? when I switch lanes
Stay doin big thangs smoke while I get brains
Line full of women can't wait to get in
Checkin mo sippin?? mo spittin
Dancefloor packed do it in the doe stack
Those that hit the C is get it get the??
Now where the hoes at? Let's get it on and poppin
Invite a few through, that's how the crew do
DJ got the crowd jumpin
The music from the speakers got the floor thumpin
I'm tryna run in sumthin

We go straight from the top down to the flo'
We makin the crowds all the while down
Smokin about a pound
You know we be puttin it down
It's Mr. Cheeks and Ho Brown baby
Sex make the beats so crazy
You know we be knockin them out

Aiyo, my first thoughts was stop when my man left
I started drinkin' more thinkin' of my mans death
Then I thought he wouldn't want to see me crumble
When he handed me the ball I promised I won't fumble
And I won't, stood on the field implore the real
These player haters hate so much now they resolve to kill
Got your pictures it ain't the same without the laugh
I pour liquor in the grass think about the past

If there was no one I could speak with I could speak with you
You knew all I was into what I've been through
They couldn't fuck with us kid we was off da chain
Blew the spot up when we came and got inside the game
From street cats we brought it to the main stream
It was an honor playin' with you on the same team
Your namely a very great deal to me
It's only right I step it up you kept it real with me

And when that day comes
We're gonna be like every children
And when that day comes
Everyone is gonna enjoy themselves

Aiyo, I'm thinkin' yous about to come through at any minute
Bless your nigga on the track, put some flavor in it
Just a thought, I'm knowin' that you're not around

Hey yo, that bum nigga rappin'
Took it the top, now I won't stop
I remember bein' broke 'cause if I didn't nigga
I'd be frontin', reminisicin' where your nigga at?

Ain't nuthin,' never thought about the hot outfits
Jewelry or the celly, back then we was in the skelly
Shorties with the barrettes, candy in the bag
The handgun, remember when we shot the fair one?

A nigga like me had the motherfuckin' pro players
And my Lees on, for a nickel got my squeeze on
Fly balls off the wall in the schoolyard
Swear to Gods, got my first quickie in school garage

I remember those days
You and I gettin' paid
Now we got it made, oh yeah
I remember, I remember

Aiyo, we open gates and let the dogs chase us home after school
Until my nigga Skee got bit, yo, but that was cool
We took him to the crib, we laughin', growin' up
We drinkin' liquor on the stool while he throwin' up

Don't got the same style, don't got the same rhymes

Ay yo, this shit is major, blow my cell and pager
Say,? I love but hate ya, love my cousin Hasha?
I'm in the strap game tight, I'm in the mix of things
Ay yo this spot here is only for the folks who came

Why were the niggas talkin'? You better keep on walkin'
You reppin' Queens nigga, I'm reppin' East New York
We keep the blunts sparkin' keep all the bitches talkin'
Stop all the yappin' nigga, before you in a coffin

Yo why you startin' Cheeks and then I stop to cough
On this track like a newborn orphan, I stay boss face
Up in the club flossin' with Dave Chanel
I just met him but I be tossin'

Yo before this niggas did it I had to Yankee fit it

Mr. Cheeks]
I run with crooks that be in Donald Goines books
Thugs selling drugs up on blocks, cops and lady looks
Ain't nothing pretty in my city that's shitty
My man's was running round up on the Isle, he caught a buck fitty
To the grill, things are getting ill
At times it makes me wanna holla, when I'm down to my last dollar bill
We keepin' it real, see, that's the only way to keep it
See I'm a legal drug thug getting Legal Drug Money so peep it
Back in the days when we used to hear about the square
I heard alotta bodies used to get caught up by shotties there
And out in 40 where Ebonishah got killed
And I be like playing cuz it feel
So much envy, got to kill a man if he comes
Fear my path... shout outs to the J wrath
And the whole LB staff

It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

It's all right, I feel light
Smoke and ball every day and night
Kill 'em with the Lost Boy crew in the park
Ass in the pool and the fools gettin sparked
I feel higher, level, nigga, they roll with the devils
Spring, I be doing my thing with my crew
This is how I do, with the Pretty Ralou

You know once niggaz start doing you, you got to do something else
Ya know what I'm saying, do bigger better things
Switch lanes with big and better rings on niggaz
Big nigga shit, fuck 'em, yeah, aiyyo

Listen, what you pappas read you thinking I ain't getting sleep
Its way past the streets no doubt the shit is getting deep

Pass the pill man I'm filling ill, I'm sick of all you cheap rappers

Plus I am the wizard that gave you your heart so

Never wanted problems it wasn't necessary
But I'm a bury niggaz quick fast in a hurry

These fuckers think I'm something sweet because I love the women
Okay these niggaz want problems it's problems that I'm giving
The crack started us off the hook and don't look for trouble
This lifestyle I live it we give it to you double

The bank shit official crack stars is who I hang with

Ayo, they gave me mad problems you won't amount to nothing
Well, look at me now I did amount to something
The rap name in vain just like a four four
No matter were us niggaz rock we watch out for popo

Still up in the struggle, I see nothing changes
These niggaz peep the way we roll so we holding bangers
Sport the jewelry cars and the shelto
Gamble for car money drink let the Ls blows

High school drop out got my G E D though
Don't speak about what I got the D-low
Yo I know nothing but the hot shit creating
Up on the road trips and hot shit we scatting

From the slums stepping representing the jump off
What we bump hard what you niggaz bump soft
Lived in Red my pops name is Rudy Chattman
My good times always started with whats happening

Just call me a hustle, grinding pies writing rhyme 9 to 5
Pimping chicks doing sticks just getting rich takes muscle
Saga of a every day struggle
Bottom line dollar signs we ain't got a dime we gotta hustle

You pour a drink for me and always think of me

I wanna come and scope you up and place you in the zone
But we could be together on the right now

Uh' shorty, turn it around lemme see somethin'
With me for real, it's gone be somethin'
Yeah, I'm talkin' lights, camera, action
Had me singin', "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"

Uh', turn it around lemme see somethin'
With me for real, it's gone be somethin'
Yeah, I'm talkin' lights, camera, action
Had me singin', "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"

I love the way it's goin' down she got the thongs on
She started bouncin' more once she heard the "Thong Song"
Them high heels got them calves lookin' right too
Shorty come live with me for the night true

I'm only tryin to holla, it's only right you holla back

I'm talkin' to these
Yeah, okay
Yeah, ooh, ooh, this one's a vivrant thing
LB, G.I. one fam, oh, my, bounce with me now
Big, dawg, hot, I'm talkin', this gone be somethin' now
Mr. Cheeks, who, I'm talkin' lights, camera, action
Okay, get down now, big dawg now one shot deal

Yea, okay
Now I'm in the spot where I wanna be
Money spent, gettin' bent, chicks in front of me
Just the way I like it, hunnies turnin' somethin'
I got a seat up in the cut and I'm burnin' somethin'

Booties dancin' 'round a and I'm killin' one
Killin' one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin' bun's
Plus I'm do' low at a table, I'm with this chick
With a phat body and the ring up in her navel

Dances around, she struts with the walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk
Do whatcha gotta do, I ain't mad at 'chu
Know a lot of haters when they seen and as bad as you

You's a real bad girl, a need that
Sippin' on ya Henny, askin' where the weed at?
Lemme put you onto somethin'
You with a big, no frontin'

Uh' shorty, turn it around lemme see somethin'
With me for real, it's gone be somethin'
Yeah, I'm talkin' lights, camera, action
Had me singin', "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"

Uh', turn it around lemme see somethin'
With me for real, it's gone be somethin'
Yeah, I'm talkin' lights, camera, action
Had me singin', "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"

Mr. Cheeks]
I run with crooks that be in Donald Goines books
Thugs selling drugs up on blocks, cops and lady looks
Ain't nothing pretty in my city that's shitty
My man's was running round up on the Isle, he caught a buck fitty
To the grill, things are getting ill
At times it makes me wanna holla, when I'm down to my last dollar bill
We keepin' it real, see, that's the only way to keep it
See I'm a legal drug thug getting Legal Drug Money so peep it
Back in the days when we used to hear about the square
I heard alotta bodies used to get caught up by shotties there
And out in 40 where Ebonishah got killed
And I be like playing cuz it feel
So much envy, got to kill a man if he comes
Fear my path... shout outs to the J wrath
And the whole LB staff

It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

It's all right, I feel light
Smoke and ball every day and night
Kill 'em with the Lost Boy crew in the park
Ass in the pool and the fools gettin sparked
I feel higher, level, nigga, they roll with the devils
Spring, I be doing my thing with my crew
This is how I do, with the Pretty Ralou
