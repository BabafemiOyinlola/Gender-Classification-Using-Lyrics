(ooh) For the way you changed my plans
For being the perfect distraction
For the way you took the idea that I have
Of everything that I wanted to have
And made me see there was something missing (oh yeah)
For the ending of my first begin (ooh yeah yeah)(ooh yeah yeah)
And for the rare and unexpected friend (ooh yeah yeah)(ooh yeah yeah)
For the way you're something that I never choose
But at the same time something I don't wanna lose
And never wanna be without ever again (oh oh)

You're the best thing I never knew I needed So when you were here
I had no idea

Baby, don't you be so mean
I try to keep my conversation clean
But you the flyest thing I seen
Since I came up in here, You're a superstar my dear

I don't wanna waste your time
(Don't waste your time)
With no corny playa lines
(No corny playa lines)
But girl if you were mine,
I would love to occupy the space right by your side

Girl, can we chill?
Talk about we'll live together, sure we will
But just for now,
don't let my champagne spill on you as you make your move
To the floor, floor, floor, floor

Girl, can we chill?
Talk about we'll live together, sure we will
Later I'll do everything you want me to

Spotlight (Prod. By Stargate & Ne-Yo)

Are you a man who loves and cherishes and cares for me?
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?
Are you a guard in a prison, maximum security?
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?
Do we stay home all the time cause you want me to yourself?
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?
Or am I locked away, out of fear that I'd find someone else
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?

Well, I don't like living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might find somebody worthy
Well, I don't like living under your spotlight
Baby if you treat me right, you won't have to worry

You make me wanna sing another love song
And it started from the day you appeared

So after this song
You gon' love me for my honesty
Or you gon' hate me for being me
Yeah, I'm sayin'
One of the two is gonna happen
With all that I can be
Is what I am and who I am

Chasing women when I should be recording
Invite a couple then I invite some more
Next thing you know it's 3 in the morning
And I've only done one song (one song)
20k on champagne in the club
Then 20k more just because
That's 40k in 3 hours
But everybody watching my section
So it's alright (alright) babe,

I know it may sound silly to you
Truthfully it's silly to me too
But that's what makes this song so true
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running in the dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right

Everybody waiting down there for me
But I roll over into your curly hair
And sexy body, oh so nice and curvy
Reminiscing on last night
Wake up baby, let me get it one more time
Before, before, before

And I fall victim to that lazy love, hey

Came in here, to shut the world out
Nothing to get into, nothing to be about
Just grab a little bite, quiet little night
By no means looking for miss right
But hello (hello), good evening
Clearly she was out with her girls alone
(That I could tell)
Beautiful with barely any make-up on

The kind that make you wanna put the games away
Think about the future but first I'll say
Hello (hello), good evening

Oh miss right (miss right)

Holding you tight

And the way that glass of wine,
Can ease your mind and soothe you

Said ooh baby
Said I wanna do it to you

From the wind that blows by
Stealin' the scent of your perfume
To the sun that touches your skin
On a Sunday afternoon

Everything that gets to know to you (Babe)
Said you got me jealous of everything
Because nothing loves you like I do

When a chick don't make decision based on a dude's wallet
She ain't in the club acting like an alcoholic
She's a pretty girl, tipsy
No stumbling and falling

If she leave the club with me
Then her maturity
Gonna make sure she follow me in her car
She's so responsible, she gone make sure
She leave in time to get home, get ready for work
Or get ready for class, because shawty major
It's business and accounting, know her mama proud of her
So for my little mama, anti-drama
So in celebration of you

Still the same niggas of course I lit a game
I just took advantage, you just took for granted
Bitches buy, nigga clear, everything is granted
Hey, you cast any the last game, living bred, no obey
Someone say with the Venice no relevant shops

Show me love when you see a nigga, sipping slow mo in a motion picture

I don't know about you
I'm doing what I do
and the way Im living is great
Only thing that I can do
Everyday continue

I don't about you
I'm doing what I do
In the way Im living is great
Only thing that I can do
Everyday continue
Giving haters reason to hate
So Imma live it up
Imma turn it up
I wanna spend it up
Cause you know I love
Give em a reason to hate

T-raw straight from a dice game came up, roll a Rolls Royce
Seats light tan, now we pop champagne for all this sufferin and pain
Use to stay in when it rain now i go out and make it rain
No shame, I can pay in years when no one shaves
Still the same niggas of course I lit a game
I just took a venige, you just took for granted
Bitches buy, nigga clear, everything is granted
Hey, you cast any the last game, living bred, no obey
Someone say with the Venice no relevant shops,
Show me off when you see a nigga, sipping slow mol in a motion picture

I know all about you
I'm doing what I do
In the way Im living is great
Only thing that I can do

True love dont exist
And I always up to you
That I know this now

It's so good a deep touch
Feel arguing kiss
But dealing with you girl
Is just not real listening

It's it mean that when the one that's seeing love
When you're always end up hurting
What happen to the special girl you used to be?
Dont know what the hell is happening to us
But this pain I'm not deserving
Girl tell me what you have to decide

Can't believe you got me think in you?
Think in you (you're an angel)
But those eyes dont see right through baby
Baby now I know the truth

No more think about in you baby

Baby you receive life, love

Close your eyes
Until you can picture this
Two people
Sharing a passionate kiss
One of love's most common tokens
But baby's kissing with her eyes wide open
Tell me what does it mean
When the one you love don't talk no more
No more going out to eat
Or romantic moonlit walks no more
No more making love from night to day
And when you look at her face
The only thing that you can say

Time's flies
When you're in love
Never telling she's
How long it takes for love to be
Over and gone
You just never know
It's like you're covering your eyes up
Nobody ever tells you
What to be like
When the end comes around

Now you're sitting all alone

But watch as I don't understand

You've got a man
But we can't control ourselves

Baby
We both know that it's wrong to cheat
So why do I dream of you all night long
And baby

And I know that before too long

Found a picture of you today
I almost threw away
It brought back things I haven't thought of in a while
Stared at the look on your face
Took me back to that place
That my mind would take me every time you'd smile
In love, in love sometimes it seems nothing ever could go wrong
You don't realize you're living in a fantasy until it's too late

You don't come crashing down into reality until she's gone
And all you've got left is the memories
Remember the way
Remember what is
What will

And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you everyday
In the memories
I remember when we would fight
Almost every night
Just so we could make up in that special way

I tried to get on with life
But every once in a while

Can ease your mind and soothe you

Said I wanna do it to you

From the wind that blows by
Stealin' the scent of your perfume
To the sun that touches your skin

To all the girls I've loved before

I cannot deny it, I cannot deny it
I done broke a few hearts, done my share of lying
I knew how to keep it quiet, I knew how to hide it
Or if I ever did get caught, I'd just deny it
If my mama knew the thangs I did, she wouldn't like it
She taught me way better, I know I knew way better
I just didn't care, running round doing whatever
With 3 of they best friends, knew 'em all together

Man, I ain't give a damn, damn
A lot of women had to deal with a boy
That was supposed to be a man, hey
So to the ones I hurt, becoming who I am

I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
For every single tear that fell to get me here

For every heart that I broke to get better
Hey, this is my apology letter, yeah

Lands on the face of a dream come true

Then she walks up behind me and throws her arms around my neck
Just another normal thing I've come to expect

Are you a guard in a prison, maximum security?

Do we stay home all the time cause you want me to yourself?
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?
Or am I locked away, out of fear that I'd find someone else
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?

You can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love,
That was even remotely real
How can you understand
Something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me,
I can help you out with all of that

Want to but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday
Knowing that I won't
I got a problem, and I (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move, but I like it
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

Think of it every second

Yeah
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

It's ridiculous,
It's been months
And for some reason I just
Can't get over us
And I'm stronger than this, yeah
Enough is enough
No more walkin' round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Babygirl, you make me say,
"Ooh ooh ooh."

Than to hear you sing

When we do our thing

Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me

Come closer (Come closer)

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break

Now hear the flow that broke the Da Vinci code
I'm psycho, everything I write go together so nice
Like a wedding make you wanna throw rice

Koo-koo clock don't tick so
Write sometimes til the chicks noodles
I got screws loose
I pull words out the air like bluetooth
I'm a sandwich short of a picnic
Ignorant thoughts come across you've sworn that i written this
But i didn't so maybe
It's good to be crazy
Isn't it baby

I wrote your name on my wall
3000 times last night
You were on my mind
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me

Then one by one i went down the line
Just repeating it
Cause it makes me smile

But my flight got cancelled wouldn't stop raining
So two days three flights later I touchdown
But there was trouble with you family and now your outta town
And I don't like it, no this ain't cool
Feeling like something just don't want me near you

Trying to get to you but it seems like
Everyday there's something new
Baby the world keeps getting in the way
With you is where I wanna be but it just won't let me
Cause it keeps getting me in the way

Said it keeps getting in the way

I realized that, she don't know how to act
Never been a dumb dude
No im not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking Me, Earl, James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty, but love for me, she didn't have any
I was inviting, her into my heart, but she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time

Trust me when I say

That I'll be ok
Go on girl

Is neither of us is listening
(And what's even worse?)
That we don't even remember why were fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing
Fighting for nothing

But we won't let it go for nothing

That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place yeah

Tell me what does it mean
When the one you love don't talk no more
No more going out to eat
Or romantic moonlit walks no more
No more making love from night to day
And when you look at her face
The only thing that you can say

Time's flies
When you're in love
Never telling she's
How long it takes for love to be
Over and gone
You just never know

So why do I dream of you all night long

Found a picture of you today
I almost threw away
It brought back things I haven't thought of in a while
Stared at the look on your face
Took me back to that place
That my mind would take me every time you'd smile
In love, in love sometimes it seems nothing ever could go wrong
You don't realize you're living in a fantasy until it's too late

You don't come crashing down into reality until she's gone
And all you've got left is the memories
Remember the way
Remember what is
What will

And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you everyday
In the memories
I remember when we would fight
Almost every night
Just so we could make up in that special way

I tried to get on with life
But every once in a while
I pull up a thought that takes me right back to those day

As your body's moving
And the way that glass of wine,
Can ease your mind and soothe you

Said ooh baby
Said I wanna do it to you

From the wind that blows by
Stealin' the scent of your perfume
To the sun that touches your skin
On a Sunday afternoon
I'm jealous

I said you got me jealous of everything
Everything that gets to know to you (Babe)
Said you got me jealous of everything
Because nothing loves you like I do
I said nothing loves you like I do

Now I don't mean to be rude
But I really don't care what your sign is
I'm trying to get to know you
Now let me get it straight

I've never been one to lick up mockery
If anything anyone else believes
If it makes you happy then yes
Do you
But personally
I don't waste my time
Being concerned with your sign
Sugar I truly could care less
So true

Tell me on your inside you're as cool as a gentle breeze
But truthfully what's that information
Really gonna do for me
Wanna know what makes you laugh
What makes you cry
I don't care about every other person
That was born in July
If that's even right

I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you

I love her cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothing in this world sexy
Than a girl that want but don't need me
Young independent, yea she work hard
But you can tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty gon shine
She don't expect nothing from no guy
She plays agressive, but she still shy
But you never know her softer side
By lookin in her eyes
No way she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my world

Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin for her throne
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love it when she say
It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it
I love it when she say
It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it

I love it cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone

She work at Onyx but she say it’s only temporary It’s been 3 years and she’s still here and now it’s gettin’ scary Says she don’t wanna dance forever, I look at her with my face like Why? Why? She’s super sexy everybody wanna know bout her And the one that everybody want, but no one's ever got her Because the way she get it in, All of the men, even the women all try, all try

Shawty’s so incredible Body language she’s a poet She’s so bad and what’s so sad And she doesn’t even know it

Little mama understand The way you do the things you do nobody else can And you can probably get whatever from whatever man Cause shawty do what’s in your soul Still it’d be a shame to see you go Cause the way you move, uh, uh Girl the way you move Girl you got them like uuh, Girl the way you move

Girl you saw the truth Can’t take my eyes away from you Girl the thangs you do Girl you keep them like uuh Baby I love the way you move

Break out the champagne, everybody get a glass
Let's start it off sexy
What do you say?
And all the ladies say (Uh-huh)

If you living that life the way you living

You can't live it any other way
I need you to put a bottle in the air right now
Welcome to the champagne life
Where trouble is a bubble in a champagne glass
Dreams and reality are one and the same
Don't act like you don't know the name
And we gone do it like this (Oh)
Got an addiction for life and this living
Like everyday's my birthday, know what I'm getting
And reserved for top notch that's where I'm sitting
Me and my friends and found six miss independents (Independents)
And my attitude's so chill and so breezy (breezy)

Or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink

'Cause lately whats been happening
Is when i'm with my girl (I call your name)
And it just aint right
That I'll be sexin her and I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Girl it ain't no little thing that I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same cause I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right

I must be honest with you baby
(Just gotta be honest babe)
I love to watch the faces that you make
(When we make love)
But when I'm behind you holding your hips
And you close your eyes and bite your lips
(I can't see you)
So might I suggest a change

Lil' mama please don't think me strange
For what I'm about to say to you
Please don't think me strange
If you know anything about me by now
You know I'm a freak, just follow my lead

Baby, I love making love in front of the mirror
(Front of the mirror)
So that I can watch you enjoying me
(Baby tonight)

Oh, Compound we got one now baby
Nephew, I see you boy, Ne-Yo! Let's go!

Girl what you want, Big chips is it?
Nice whips?
A nice boot with jeans that just fit into perfection how they stick to 'em hips?
She's so serious
Ohhh, your walk is vicious, delicious
Millionaire's wife so above mistress
And lookin' at me like "Come get this"
This one is a superstar
Can I be the sky that you shine in?
Dedicated I put the time in
Shorty that's the frame of mind I'm in
Let me show you who you are
Can you be my present and future?
Can I show ya things ya not used to?
Baby where's the contract?

Shawty won't you sign me up?
Won't you put me down?
I just wanna rock wit' you, rock wit' you baby

Little mama so thick, I'm so sick

She's a hot one, clock go click
And she know it measurements 36'24, 4'6
And everywhere you have a problem
Probably tired of hearing it

Yeah (Yeah)
Shorty I don't wanna waste your time
It ain't a secret baby girl you fine
You could have anybody here that you want, that's right
Including this fella
Cuz you're a diamond and I dig your shine yeah

But I don't gotta tell you that
You know you look good

Yeah, yeah, well, Oh Yeah, Yeah Yeah
When I'm single it don't really matter who it is
Or how many I decide to kick it with
Long as she can understand how I do it
I'm a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks
But when I settle down find a woman to live for
Still may be a couple cuties at my door
Thinking we could get down like we did before
And get mad when I tell her
It can't be like that no more

Girl, you know I got a girl
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that

Understand baby girl that I'm a totally new man
I don't live to crush as many as I can, no no
Found a girl that changed my whole game plan

She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch and I errupt
Like a volcano and cover her with my love

Babygirl, you make me say,
"Ooh ooh ooh."
And I just can't think
(Of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing

When we do our thing

We were a couple and, walking and holding hands
Kisses and I love you's, doing what lovers do, Baby
But baby that was then

'Cause now we don't talk no more
You got a new man and, It shouldn't bother me
But girl it's driving me, crazy
And everybody says
Boy why don't you just leave it alone?
But I don't think I can

I sit up all night thinkin' 'bout you
And, I know it ain't right, baby
But I don't, I don't think that I
Don't think that I can let go (Don't think I can let you go)

How come you don't make time for me anymore?
That's the last thing she said to you
And now when you call she don't answer any more
Or the line is busy and you can't get through

In the time it would take you to learn from your mistakes
In the time it would take to dial the phone
In the time it would take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone
She's moved on to someone who takes the time

42nd Street, 4am
I'm rolling slowly, no destination in mind
Driver looking at me, strange 'cause I got in
(In)
Handed him a lot of cash
Sat back and told him, "Just drive"
(Drive)

I'm thinkin' 'bout the day
You packed your things and left
Sayin' you knew all about
Chanel, Tiffany, Tracy, Stephanie

You went away
So I'm writing in the fog
Upon the window to express myself
And how I'm feelin'

Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(Lone)

Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely

I see a woman walking with her man
(Man)
Man with his woman smiling
As they stroll into this little bar
(Bar)
As they kiss each other holding hands

I'm so sick
It happened so quick
looking at old flicks
Trying to figure out where we went wrong
The radio turns on
had some song waiting to hear
both of our favorite parts
each word is eating at my heart
alot of you aint gotta a boo
trying to move on
Ne-yo tell em what's the first thing they gotta do

(Ne-Yo)
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
Cuz right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cus you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice
Anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this

No more walking 'round with ma head down
I'm so over being blue

Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
Let me get those bags from Paris, and the puppies is staying, yo

Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and this dude ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get your man back like that
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and this dude got beef

But you don't get your man back like that, no

Aiyo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
Cuz I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird you know that, giving that man

In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it, to him

This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday
Knowing that I won't
I got a problem, and I (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move, but I like it
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because
Never get enough

Now hear the flow that broke the Da Vinci code

Everything i wrote go
Together so nice
Like a wedding make you wanna throw rice

Koo-koo clock don't tick so
Write sometimes til the chicks noodles
I got screws loose
I pull words out the air like bluetooth
I'm a sandwich short of a picnic
Ignorant thoughts come across you've sworn that i written this
But i didn't so maybe
It's good to be crazy
Isn't it baby

3000 times last night
You were on my mind

Maybe this decision was a mistake
You probably don't care what I have to say
But it's been heavy on my mind for months now
Guess I'm trying to clear some mental space
I would love to talk to you in person
But I understand why that can't be
I'll leave you alone for good I promise
If you answer this one question for me

I just wonder, do you ever,
Think of me anymore, do you?

First off let me say congratulations

Let me talk to 'em
I guess you know you made it when they start talking 'bout you, right?
Welcome to fame
Y'all don't pay me no mind
I just gotta get some stuff off my chest, listen
Young, energetic, famous, but don't really sweat it
Rich enough, fairly hot, so, basically, sex is not
Difficult to get
That ain't my fault, no, no, listen
And just 'cause I might take advantage once or twice
People tell me I'm not right, thinking that sex was my life
But that just ain't me
So let me clear it up for those who have obviously misread the code
Listen to me now
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be

I believe that love and trust are one in the same
I don't think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them
That blind trust, that beyond a shadow of a doubt
No matter what this person sayin, that person
You believe your man
Now you say you love me, but every time one of your little friends come at you with something
We gotta do this
Mama I'm tryin, I'm trying to show you that I'm for real
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you

Back and forth about it in my mind
Could she, could she really be
Who he's telling me that she is
There's something about it
That don't feel right

[Bridge 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
Said today she called here 26 times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me

You're leaving tonight
Out of my life
Everyone said you ain't no good
Then you prove them right

Thirty seconds before you turned on this song
You was feeling something, something was wrong
Now that it's on, there's a smile on your face
And whatever was wrong, it's faded away

For the moment, the song will change your life
But if you believe, well it just might
If you listen right, the part that touches your heart
And your soul, that's what it does

And it might make you lose your mind, that's what it does
And it might make you cry sometimes, that's what it does
And it might chase the pain away, that's what it does
The devil, the angel, the pain and the pleasure
The music, that's what it does

Yesterday you were crying the loss of a man

Style of your hair
Shape of your eyes and your nose
The way you stare as if you see right through to my soul

It's your left hand and the way
That it's not quite as big as your right
The way you stand in the mirror
Before we go out at night
Our quiet time
Your beautiful mind

They're all part of the list, things that I miss
Things like your funny little laugh
Or the way you smile, or the way we kissed
What I noticed is this
I come up with something new

Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie

I just wanna be numb
I don't wanna feel a thing
I don't want reality
Actually, reality stinks

How about we just pretend
That your cellphone didn't even ring?
And that I wasn't on the other side of the door
Listening to everything
Tell me another lie

I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie

Okay, I woke up in heaven today
She kissed me I floated away, away
Never felt anything so great
Alright, Now I brace myself for the fights
Something must go wrong cause is way too right
I'm light as a feather tonight, Yeah, Yeah

Cause I can't feel the ground
Someone let me down
I never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true
I don't deserve you
I never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning
Stop this world from spinning

She wanted the money, fame
The brand names, fancy cars
She left a hard working man behind
For a fellow with a championship ring

Oh, but see here's the thing about dating a superstar
She was one of like eight or nine
Just another ball player's plaything
Oh, and I'm singing

What's the matter with you baby?
What's the matter with you baby?
What's the matter with you, oh you?
Said ain’t that your dream come true?

What's the matter with you baby?

No one to blame but you
No one to blame but you, you yeah

He wanted the money, fame

Lookin’ up to the pusher man
He wanted to be like them oh so bad

I love her cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothing in this world sexy
Than a girl that want but don't need me
Young independent, yea she work hard
But you can tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty gon shine
She don't expect nothing from no guy
She plays agressive, but she still shy
But you never know her softer side
By lookin in her eyes
No way she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my world

Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin for her throne
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love it when she say
It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it

And I swear I know her face

Turn the music up in here

Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me

Come closer (Come closer)

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop

But I don't want to escape

And she begs me all the time to help her
I know that I should but im lazy so I don't (Hmm yeah)
She's always considering my feelings
Thinkin of me before herself
Most of the time I'm so damn selfish
I dont even realize she treats me so well

She's so much better than me

At the far end of the aisle
Standing where I should be standing
Some other man on his face there's a smile

Face it you messed up and now she's with somebody else, yeah, yeah

And now all I can do is smile

Won't answer your phone
Well I'm sorry
I wont attend your pity party
I rather go have calamari
And maybe a drink
And yes I think
You should come with me, life isn't long
There will be pain but life goes on
With everyday a brand new song
But if you rather stay at home
Let me do you a favor

I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry

We could've made everything OK
But we just
Threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground

I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all
'Member we used to touch the sky

And lightning don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
We let it drift
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry

C'mon babe can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry

And my heart is sure it wants to be with you
Wanna give you the whole world
If you make the promise to me, You're gonna stay
Without you guiding me, I'm lost and so confused

What will it take to show you I'll be by your side

Girl everyday I hope to make you part of my life
Cause you know me and I know you
Girl your love is where it's at

And some we never wish we made
But we'll be okay if we just stay together

Feel arguing kiss
But dealing with you girl

It's it mean that when the one that's seeing love
When you're always end up hurting
What happen to the special girl you used to be?
Dont know what the hell is happening to us
But this pain I'm not deserving
Girl tell me what you have to decide

Can't believe you got me think in you?
Think in you (you're an angel)
But those eyes dont see right through baby
Baby now I know the truth

No more think about in you baby

Baby you receive life, love
When that is until
You filt the script

Tell myself I'll stop everyday
Knowing that I won't
I got a problem, and I (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move, but I like it
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)

Baby you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby you got everything money just can't buy
All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy

Got a diamond in the back, sunroof top
Got a diamond on my hat and my sunroof off
Her mind strong but her body so soft
Tattoo on her hip read "Only for a Boss"
She ain't impressed with the way I ball
She said "You seen one ghost, you seen ‘em all"
Even though that thing cold
She said "A Rolls Royce, you're a Civic, Daddy I'mma roll with you"
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that's how she do

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

It's ridiculous,
It's been months
And for some reason I just
Can't get over us
And I'm stronger than this, yeah
Enough is enough
No more walkin' round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

Girl let me love you, and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you, I know your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help

Girl let me love you and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself

But it's been heavy on my mind for months now
Guess I'm trying to clear some mental space

I would love to talk to you in person

Never been a dumb dude
No im not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking Me, Earl, James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty, but love for me, she didn't have any
I was inviting, her into my heart, but she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine

'Cause lately whats been happening
Is when i'm with my girl (I call your name)
And it just aint right
That I'll be sexin her and I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Girl it ain't no little thing that I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same cause I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right

I must be honest with you baby
(Just gotta be honest babe)
I love to watch the faces that you make
(When we make love)
But when I'm behind you holding your hips
And you close your eyes and bite your lips
(I can't see you)
So might I suggest a change

Lil' mama please don't think me strange
For what I'm about to say to you
Please don't think me strange
If you know anything about me by now
You know I'm a freak, just follow my lead

Baby, I love making love in front of the mirror
(Front of the mirror)
So that I can watch you enjoying me
(Baby tonight)

Nice whips?
A nice boot with jeans that just fit into perfection how they stick to 'em hips?
She's so serious
Ohhh, your walk is vicious, delicious
Millionaire's wife so above mistress
And lookin' at me like "Come get this"
This one is a superstar
Can I be the sky that you shine in?
Dedicated I put the time in
Shorty that's the frame of mind I'm in
Let me show you who you are
Can you be my present and future?
Can I show ya things ya not used to?

And she know it measurements 36'24, 4'6
And everywhere you have a problem
Probably tired of hearing it

Shorty I don't wanna waste your time
It ain't a secret baby girl you fine
You could have anybody here that you want, that's right

Cuz you're a diamond and I dig your shine yeah

Yeah, yeah, well, Oh Yeah, Yeah Yeah

Or how many I decide to kick it with
Long as she can understand how I do it
I'm a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks
But when I settle down find a woman to live for
Still may be a couple cuties at my door
Thinking we could get down like we did before
And get mad when I tell her
It can't be like that no more

Girl, you know I got a girl
I just don't get down like that

Baby you fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that

That's the last thing she said to you
And now when you call she don't answer any more
Or the line is busy and you can't get through

In the time it would take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone

Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break

could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
when you make your angry face

I love lookin' at you
In the way God intended us
I'm talking about nothin' on but a smile
And a little bit of sweat from when we made love
And you got me singing

Ohhh
Oh, Yo' body makes me call
Ohhh
I throw up my hands
Say thank you to the man
Cause' just to touch you is a blessing
And i'm glad I can
All I can say is Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby
You got me religious

Ooh, And all I can say

Clap for her, clap for her
Cause they don't make em like her no more
Clap for her, clap for her
Cause they don't make em like you no

Shorty not the regular in all this
Tell me what you call it
When a chick don't make decision based on a dude's wallet
She ain't in the club acting like an alcoholic
She's a pretty girl, tipsy
No stumbling and falling

If she leave the club with me
Then her maturity
Gonna make sure she follow me in her car
She's so responsible, she gone make sure
She leave in time to get home, get ready for work
Or get ready for class, because shawty major
It's business and accounting, know her mama proud of her
So for my little mama, anti-drama
So in celebration of you

Shawty I'ma raise a glass,
Here's a toast to the ladies with class,

Saying hey-ey-ey

Girl the way you are
Cause they don't make like you no more

Baby girl, keep doing you, how you do, I love the way you move

You swallowed my face
When you kissed me today
It was sweet but okay
That's a little much
And when we walk down the street
You"ll be right under me
I can't move two feet without your touch

Ungrateful, oh no I am not
Most women would give to have what i got (i know)
All I'm saying is that sometimes baby
There's nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe

Baby I just need a little space
A little break
From you today
No I don't want you to go away
But just for today
Go over there

Oooh my lobby call was 11:30
I'm officially the opposite of early
I gotta go downstairs (downstairs)
Everybody waiting down there for me
But I roll over into your curly hair
And sexy body, oh so nice and curvy
Reminiscing on last night
Wake up baby, let me get it one more time
Before, before, before
I gotta go, I got responsibilities
I gotta take care of, (oh-woah, oh-woah)
That's when you wrap them legs around me
And I fall victim to that lazy love, hey

I became her lover, she became my lover.
Had her heart broke, I was helping her recover.
I became the man she knew she could rely on.
Somebody to listen or shoulder to cry on.
She was getting better, better she was getting.
The more time spent, the more she would forget him.
But then back around he seen that he started coming, and shes on the low taking phone calls from him.

I thought that we were building something strong.
He apologizes and now your gone.
And I won't put up with this.

You wanna go. (Go.)
Just hope you know.
Baby your gonna be lonely, lonely again.
Oh lonely, lonely.
Go on go, go. Just hope you know. (Hey.)
Baby your gonna be lonely, lonely again.
Lonely, lonely again.
Don't call me when your lonely again.
When your lonely again, lonely again.
Oh, sugga don't call me when your lonely again, when your lonely again.
Lonely again. (Oh.)

The worst part about fighting with yourself
Is that even if you win, you lose
Can't place the blame on anybody else
So I'm fighting with myself over you

I should have played it different, but I didn't know
I never pictured you without me or you letting go
I should have seen it coming, I should have thought it through
The best part of me has always been you
And no apology can bring you back to me
Feel like I'm suffocating, you are the air I'm breathing out
I'm so down and can't move and I'm beating me up over you

The worst part about fighting with yourself

I never said that every choice
I made everyone was gonna like.
I never said that satisfying the masses
Was how i would live my life.
I never once did i say all of my decisions would be right.
I never said i would ignore
My heart and listen with just my mind.
Hmm, and i know it looks like i've gone crazy.
But in the way of love and what it does, i'll be crazy for us.

So call me a fool, call me insane.
Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.
I don't mind, no i don't mind.
Forget the rules, i'm over the game.
Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous.
Then call me ridiculous. call me ridiculous.

Everyone knows what i'm suppose to do.
Everybody says i'm out my mind to feel what i feel for you.

Anything that might bring up
Memories of the days
And the nights we spent in love
You were my favourite song
Baby tell me why we had to turn the radio off

Girl I ain't trippin on you
I'm just fine
You hardly ever even cross my mind
Even though a blind man could look in my face
And just know that that's a lie
I'm barely treading water
Saying I'm alright

Cuz I can't stop crying
And I can't stop asking why
But I can't stop lying
And if you ask me I'll deny
That I can't stop crying
On the outside I'm alright
But I'm dying on the inside

Saw you out yesterday

Can't feel bad about feeling this good,
Come on love, you know we tried,
And i apologize for going about it the wrong way,
But for falling in love, i can't say i'm sorry.
I'll admit it, it's wrong
the way that did occured
we was there together
and i fell in love with her
but you gotta admit,
we were both on our way out
(we wouldnt even talk to each other)
I know i should of broken up,

For that im wrong, but for loving her its no, no

'Bout to go to bed
She been calling her man for hours
And he ain't picking up his phone
And soon the other night she's all alone
She wished she had someone to put it on
But she don't so she gon' let me put her rivers on
She rubbing lotion on her body
Pretending that her hands are mine
Touching herself how she want me to touch her
I'm not a star in her mind I'm her lover

She close her eyes

To sweat out a good weave or two in my time
Multiple amounts of head boards cracked in half
Put the hurtin on many a dime
I've scared up lots of knees with carpet burns
Hot candle waxed the whole night
Blind folds n handcuffs

Real full time freak with mine
Real talk

Sugar I don't got a problem with
Givin you a little demonstration right quick
Lay back let me set off really
Kiss to the lips in between your hips
Follow me now
Straight to the bed

Slide it to the side and signal me home

I don't recall
Ever shedding any tears
Joy that you put here
It feels as if I've never experienced fear

It used to be so clear to me
What it is to just be unhappy
But I look at your face
And all of that's erased

This love messes with my head
It makes me forget
What loneliness is
And this love messes with my mind
Makes it hard to find
Any reason to cry

How many times did I ask 'why are you with him'?
How many times did I beg you to run away?
How many times did he tell you it won't happen again?
And how many times did it happen the very next day?

And now I'm asking why didn't you listen to me?
Why didn't I do something,
Though you said 'please just let it be'?
Why did I let him take you from me?
The choices we make, to right the mistakes.
Too little too late.

What did I say the very first time it happened?
I said where is he now and what do you want me do to?
Why did you tell me no, why were you protecting him?

That you gon' lay back

Oooooh oooh ooh 27th of january, think he died a year ago today
She's crying on my shoulder and begging me to make the hurting go away
Pretty brown eyes, tears full of guilt, a heart full of pain and fear
I wanna tell her it's okay but we both know she's the reason he's not here.

I keep on crying, but it doesn't seem to help at all With every single tear drop, it's like another raindrop falls
And I would, if I could .but the try would be in vain Said so matter what I do.I can't stop the rain.
So I cry
Oooooooh.I can't stop the rain If I could, you know I would.but the try would be in vain.
So I cry
Oooooooh.I can't stop the rain Faded picture in a little gold locket, and she never takes it off
I know it's small, but it's heavy 'cus it's filled with guilt

Chronicles of the streetlights
Chapter one
(uh)

Diamond is seventeen building like she's twenty-three
all of the guys she meet pretty much all say the same thing
promising a way out
(Lil momma listen, I can make you a star)
with all the game they putting her in
it's not a wonder she can't hear her screaming "hold on"
don't let yourself be fooled, you know better
last time we saw diamond in a mini skirt getting into some mans car
that's the last we heard the streetlights

If these streetlights could tell what they see
Everyone with a different story
Maybe then we could find a way to make it right
and not be another story for the streetlights

Look at how she looking at you
You know you wanna get it crackin'

I'm in this restaurant bathroom trying to call you
Trying to figure out what kind of lie to tell
At the table sits a sexy little something I just met, and I don't know her that well
I know it is wrong but I don't give a damn
That I got you sitting at home thinking that your man
Is out working, and doing right by you
Not thinking that someday it would all catch up to me

People used to say you got a good girl that loves you, you should really stop running (but I wasn't trying to hear them out)
What about when she finds out and leaves you all alone?(Whatever)
Tell me, what you gonna do then (I'll just turn and say don't worry me now)

Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (said don't worry me now)
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (said when I come to it)

Used to think it could never happen to me (never happen to me)
Threw up my hands and say (don't worry me now)

There's no problem that I can't solve
In a test of our love
If your love was multiple choice
You'd be all of the above
You're the answer to all my questions
No need to cheat
Together we're the perfect score
You make me complete
I never seen a woman
With so much beauty and class
My heart was always a failure
Until you helped me pass
I wanna give you my all now
No more excuses
Cause without you in my life
My life is just useless

I played every game in the book
But you changed my perspective
And for the first time

Love, my only objective
Our moments can be feelings
Things aren't always what they seem
Baby if I'm sleeping

I'd be a fool to think I was the only one
I know you've got a few
So I try not to involve my emotions
It's just no use baby
Everthing that you do makes me
Just want you more

Baby, when I look at you
I just want you more
When you touch me like you do
I just want some more
Baby, baby you're forbidden fruit
And the fact that I can't have ya
Just makes me want you more

You are temptation in everyway

Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it
Is it because he, treated you so badly
I always stand accused
Protecting yourself, from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you

And it's killing me girl you compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl would I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

Doing what i do, when she
Crept. and ever so gently
Walked over and just looked at me
(is there a problem?)- i said
She just stood staring at my eyes
Wondering, why no reply
Suddenly she begins to cry
(baby we need to talk)

Then she begins, asking me about the weekend
She went out the town with 3 friends
Just her and the girls
(do you remember?)
And she says - baby
I haven't been very honest lately
And i don't want you to hate me
But baby, i got a confess right now - (she said)

Told you i was out with my friends (but)

Everybody was trying to tell me
But you had me blinded
It's all good though
Now I understand…

What you did was shady, girl
Thought you were my lady, girl, that's why
I straight made you girl
Gave you all the finer things in life
Homie said to stop the flow
Told me you were nothing but a ho
I ignored him though
And you took me through fo sho

I guess this must be why
Most guys (Don't get personal)
Just when we decide
It's all right (We get left alone)
And even though I try, I can't hide

And I know that I should turn
Off the radio
But it's the only place I hear your voice anymore

Don't know why it came to this no

No more walking round with my head down

Crying over you

If you're so sick of love songs
So tired of tears

So sad and slow

Wanted to feel the sun on your back
But it rained on your head instead
But on the bright side despite this hassle
Wet sand makes for a better sand castle
Inhale exhale just take a breath
And know that things don't always happen like they should

Gotta learn to roll with the punches and just say it's all good

Cause it's like falling down
When everyone's watching
In the final round
Fight your hardest but lose
It's like shouting out
But nobody can hear you
But when it's all said and done

Gotta get the work done

Sometimes my mind and heart disagree
And I don't always know who to follow so where does that leave me?

Stuck in the middle, of this small space
{With just a number on this day}
I never said I knew what was I doing
I'm stuck in the middle of wrong and right, with no-one to be my guide in life.

Or even better yet
If let you do it
Tell me baby would you like it

Something's got me open in here
Either the music or you
Halo Halo Halo
All I know is something' s making
Making you wanna do
Halo Halo Halo

Tonight
Would you mine?
if I took off my halo
Tonight
Would you mine?
If I just let myself go
Whatever you want,
Tonight
I don't Know how to say no
Somethin makin me wanna take off all my clothes

I don't wanna know you
I don't wanna know your name
Said I don't wanna call you or talk about anything
I don't wanna like you,
I don't care if you like me
Said if you haven't caught on yet,
I lied through my tears
See the problem is more I fight it,
harder to it gets to deny it
But everything in me wants to be with you
But I seem were love can leave you devastated
So everyday I look at the mirror and say this
I tell my self

Don't wanna be, I, don't wanna be in love
Don't wanna be, I, don't wanna be in love
Cause I know what it is, and I know what it does
So I don't wanna be in love
Right now it loves too much

But I don't wanna move too fast and mess this up

But for now is good night, good night
Take it slow, and go on where we're already to
So baby good night for now
Pretty good night, yeah, yeah

Standing here
Watching you
Wondering how I ever found you cute and I don't feel bad
Cause I can tell that you
sometimes look at me wondering the same thing thing too

Suddenly it's very simple
I think that I know what's wrong
I figured out why it's so painful
for me and you to get along

Nothing in common
Nothing is right
I don't like you or the things that you like
We got nothing in common
So sad but true
You go your way, I'll go mine
cause I got nothing in common with you.
(ooh whoa whoa, Woah)
Cause I got nothing common with you.

Round and Round they go
Wow but in control
and if you didn't know
(I'm talking bout her hips man)
Fools run up behind
they've been trying to grind
she pays them no mind
(because she knows they can't have)
One-O in the face
thong made out of lace
tight below the waist
yep she got a mon-star
But don't stare too long
only takes a song
poof your mind is gone
yup she put it on ya

Some folks call her Miss's Hypnotic
Everything she do is Hypnotic
watching her hips move
(Hypnotic)
Goodness gracious that's the Hypnotic

Winding her body and staring at you

Body like a sports car, no speed limit

Keep looking over here, looking over here
Came in the club on the arm of another
Why feedin him, but she creep under cover
She looking over here, looking over here
Keep looking over here, looking over here.

Really tryin to fight temptation, but this girl is testing my patience
She wanna go
Smiling at me oh soo sexual (I can't take no more)

Watch her tell him she goin to the bathroom

I Pulled her in and this is what I said to her:

Used to make love here
Now this place feels
Like a prison cell
So many questions

Not today (Not today)

And we communicate
This way ohhh baby

Never thought that it be
She get tired of me
And leave me all alooooooooone
But she did

Looking back on the argument
All of it seems to turn into a great big blur
Dont they call all that the said this relationship is dead
Dead in the water I thought a response to my blatant
this respect would be heard
Regular thing regular thing die a bit
individual and get over it get over it

Not this time
Shawty got hip to the game
Not this line
Oh that line will work
I normally can talk a bum into buying dirt
I normally can talk a nun up out her skirt

But not this time
She wasnt go far for my sweet talk
No not at all
Nobody to blame was all my fault
trying to be slick messed around and got caught

There's me,
Strong in what I believe
But at times I try be correct politically
There's her,
Hard headed as can be,
Makes no apologies, the opposite of me

But when it comes to love
I'm inspired by her middle finger to the world
And I love that she don't care how they see us
And because of her now I don't either
And I love that she will not let them beat us
And because of her now I won't either
Now I won't either

There's us,
Opposite enough to occasionally fuss

And I know what'll make it alright
Boy your kiss that's all i need
Just one to help me get through the night
Don't know where you are in the world
But drop what you're doing and get to your girl

Less than all but more than a few
But I've never met one like you

Been all over the world
Done a little bit of everything
Little bit of everywhere
With a little bit of everyone
All the girls I've been with
Things I've seen it takes much to impress
But sure nough your glow it makes
Your soul stand out from all the rest, baby

I can be in love
But I just don't know (don't know girl)
Baby one thing is for certain

Flyest in the room without trying to be
Dressed to the nice

We're a hurricane
So destructive in the way that we do
A little bit insane
But she loves it just the same and me too

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related, the way that they make us act
But baby girl, the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing but not you
'Cause you're my crazy love
Can't tell me nothing 'bout how we do
We got crazy love

I'm intelligent, I'm not stupid, not at all
But my common sense, when it comes to you it falls
Then I do something dumb

Babygirl you make me say ooh ooh ooh

And I just can't think of anything else I'd rather do
Than to hear you sing, sing my name the way you do
When we do our thing when we do the things we do
Babygirl you make me say ooh ooh ooh

Sexy love girl the things you do
(Oh baby baby)
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
(Oh baby I)
Ooh I love making love to you
Babygirl you know you're
My sexy love

I'm so addicted to her she's the sweetest drug

Mmmm mmm yeah
Do do do do do do do-do
Ohh Yeah

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(it's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just
(can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this
(enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears

Jet setter
Go getter
Nothing better
Call me Mr. been there done that
Top model chick to your every day hood rat
Less than all but more than a few
But I've never met one like you

Been all over the world
Done a little bit of everything
Little bit of everywhere
With a little bit of everyone
All the girls I've been with
Things I've seen it takes much to impress
But sure nough your glow it makes
Your soul stand out from all the rest, baby

I can be in love
But I just don't know (don't know girl)
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's working
Other girls don't matter
In your presence can't do what you do
There's a million girls around but I don't see no one but you

Girl you're so one in a million, you are

Ignorant thoughts come across you've sworn that i written this
But i didn't so maybe
It's good to be crazy

Never been a dumb dude
No im not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking Me, Earl, James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty, but love for me, she didn't have any
I was inviting, her into my heart, but she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time

Is neither of us is listening

That we don't even remember why were fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing

But we won't let it go for nothing

She said "You seen one ghost, you seen ‘em all"
Even though that thing cold
She said "A Rolls Royce, you're a Civic, Daddy I'mma roll with you"
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that's how she do

I love lookin' at you
In the way God intended us
I'm talking about nothin' on but a smile
And a little bit of sweat from when we made love
And you got me singing

Ohhh
Oh, Yo' body makes me call
Ohhh
I throw up my hands
Say thank you to the man
Cause' just to touch you is a blessing
And i'm glad I can
All I can say is Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby
You got me religious
You got me religious
You got me religious
Ooh, And all I can say

Is Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby
You got me religious
You got me religious
You got me religious
I love being with you

She know, how to back it up and drop it down
She know, she what all the fellas looking at
Cause they know, soon as her song come on it's a wrap

And she loves the attention

Showin' out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh

Aiight boys and girls, gather 'round. Story time. Check this out

I said, "I wish you'd just give it a try
You've never done it, how you know what you don't like?"
She said, "Am I not enough for you, is that why?"
I said, "No, I just think it would be sexy and kinda fly"
She said, "Well I don't"
I said, "Well if I let you pick the girl, would that make a difference?"
She said, "That don't matter cause I just don't think I'm cool with a threesome"

Cause you can't tell me that you don't like girls, don't lie"

She's a ballerina
Discipline so superb
Blessed with swan leg grace
Curse with Houston curves
The teachers hate her features
Beat her down with words
Saying there's somewhere else she
Should be dancing with a body like hers
Shawty been lead astray
Considering what they say

No matter what they try to tell ya
Know that you are not lost
When they question your direction
Know that you are not lost
Don't you let nobody tell you your way (tell you your way)

It's gonna be a beautiful night
Break out the champagne, everybody get a glass
Let's start it off sexy
What do you say?
And all the ladies say (Uh-huh)

And all the ladies say (Uh-huh)
Think I like that

And all the ladies say (Uh-huh)

If you living that life the way you living

You can't live it any other way
I need you to put a bottle in the air right now
Welcome to the champagne life
Where trouble is a bubble in a champagne glass
Dreams and reality are one and the same
Don't act like you don't know the name
And we gone do it like this (Oh)
Got an addiction for life and this living
Like everyday's my birthday, know what I'm getting
And reserved for top notch that's where I'm sitting
Me and my friends and found six miss independents (Independents)
And my attitude's so chill and so breezy (breezy)

And this is where the magic happens
So without further a do

I think I need a moment with you
Said no need to audition
You're beautiful
So tell me what you're drinking
Baby let me know
You don't gotta pay for another one of those tonight
Baby I'm something like a big deal
Somebody you're pleased to know

[Pre-Chorus]

And you should get to know me
Flyest in the room without trying to be
Dressed to the nice
Swag genuine
So special
So rare
Never hard to find

Know I'm kinda cocky
But smiling I'm the boss
I mean it ain't just talk

Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice
You noticing me and I was definitely noticing you
My name is you know my name
But listen, I have a question

No, it ain't like me to drop too hard
Or go out of my way to know who you are
Said if you're not one for chasing but I'll admit

Something in you has got my attention, girl
So if I can be a gentleman
Can I ask your permission, girl?

Said if it's alright with you
Can I know your name?
And maybe call you sometime
Can I know your name?
Can I know your name?

Ladies, welcome to the gentleman's lair
Understand that what happens here stays here
So with that being said, inhibition off

Close your eyes if you're feeling bad
But there are things I'm gonna do to you
Sexy things, ooh, amazing things
That you're gonna need to see to believe are true

Hypnotized, not in here, baby
But your state of mind will be altered
Paradise is my body, girl
And we're gonna go there 'cause you wanna go there

Girl, have you ever
Had someone take the time
To sex your body
But also sex your mind

Baby, let me touch you without touching you

We're a hurricane
So destructive in the way that we do
A little bit insane
But she loves it just the same and me too

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related, the way that they make us act
But baby girl, the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing but not you
'Cause you're my crazy love
Can't tell me nothing 'bout how we do
We got crazy love

I'm intelligent, I'm not stupid, not at all
But my common sense, when it comes to you it falls
Then I do something dumb

Nothing better
Call me Mr. been there done that
Top model chick to your every day hood rat
Less than all but more than a few
But I've never met one like you

Been all over the world
Done a little bit of everything
Little bit of everywhere
With a little bit of everyone
All the girls I've been with
Things I've seen it takes much to impress
But sure nough your glow it makes
Your soul stand out from all the rest, baby

I can be in love
But I just don't know (don't know girl)
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's working
Other girls don't matter
In your presence can't do what you do
There's a million girls around but I don't see no one but you

Girl you're so one in a million, you are

We may even very well see hell's front gates
Don't think that you or I
Are above making mistakes
Said I'm gonna get on your damn nerves
And you gonna make me mad
But I know we'll survive all that
Cause love this good could never be that bad

So may you never know the way
Way that it feels
Feels to be lonely
May you never know one day
When love isn't real
See this stuff to me is genuine only

And pull out your soul

Sit and think about what I did wrong

Ain't no secret I'm the one

Sure as the moon shines

Catered to my own desires
Never once thinking

You believe your man

We gotta do this

Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you

Back and forth about it in my mind
Could she, could she really be
Who he's telling me that she is
There's something about it
That don't feel right

Saturday she called here 26 times

You kept telling me not to worry

Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
