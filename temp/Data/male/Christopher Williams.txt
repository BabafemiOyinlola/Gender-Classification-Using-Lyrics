It could be so simple, yet complicated
'Cause one minute we're in love, and then you changed
Do we move our tempos? And we go to stages
But that feeling in your heart you can't tame it
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I know just what you really want
You should know better, know better
Know better, know better
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I know just what you really want
She know better, know better
Know better, know better
But you can't find it, better hold on to something here today
Before is too late, too late love
Too late, too late
I'd be subconscious when everything that you want
Is in your past,
Don't let it be
Too late, too late
Don't let it be

I almost turned and walked away
But there are words in me that I have to say
You fill the empty space in my heart

You came out of nowhere to rescue me
Now I have a reason to give the best of me

And I'm learning to love again
Starting out as friends
When I need someone to console me
On you, I can depend

I'm learning to love again
Finally my heart's beginning to mend
And I'm learning to love again

[Christopher talking softly:]
Yeah, a girl like you, comes along once in a life time...
Huh, I'm sure glad I got you...
Just like this (ahh... yeah)
Check me out...

So nice to be here
In my favorite room
The fire is burning bright and I see yooou in the light
Your silhouette winding slow for me
And after all this time your still sooo fine

You're my...
You're my little sexy lady [lady singing]
There's no need to stray... noo...

I was a lonely man
On a long and winding road
My Money was tight
I was struggling to survive
But then you came my way
Like an angel here on earth
And you believed in me
You helped me change my life

But I'm not a perfect man
But I'm glad you understand
I wanna be
Your heart and soul provider
But I'm not a perfect man
But I'm glad you understand
That with my love
I will protect like a soldier
Now it's amazing to me
How your life can truly change
When you've got a woman

Sometimes you wonder how much I care
I get so distracted running nowhere
And I take it for granted our love is secure
If I started losing you, one thing is sure

I'd be down on my knees, ready to pray, darlin'
Down on my knees, making you stay
I'd be begging you please, don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees

I learned to be strong a long time ago
And I can face any wind no matter how hard it blows
But I'd have to be stronger than I want to be
If I had to live without you loving me

No, come on, I said no
No means no now

I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do
I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do

People ask me why

Always alone

Well, I used to be sweet

But I've been used and abused
For the last time

I'm so sorry

I've been in love before and it let me down
Now I'm all grown up no turning back girl
Like a child's heart a play
you know the things we used to say
(you remember baby)
When we were in love we made

(Chorus)
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep

Girl when you broke out, I thought life would end
Now I'm all strung out
Try'na pick up the pieces once again

It seems no matter what I do
Bad luck has been my best friend

Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Yo I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number
Seventeen and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you
Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Everytime I look at you, you turn and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me loosing my mind
With your zodiac sign, my perfect match in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drug
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away
I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying
If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eyes when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day
What can I say?
All I can do is reminisce like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us

I feel you so close every time you breathe
I need you more than I needed anyone, it's true
I wanna make love to you

Walking down some crowded street
Your laughter so pure, sounds like a symphony
Desire sweeps through me tryin' to stay cool, it's true
I wanna make love to you, wanna make love to you

And it feels like we've waited so long
Just to see what we really feel
Girl, with you by my side
My world comes alive

You whisper so soft something I can't repeat
Your skin brushes close, touches mine so innocently
The sun burns hot, need some relief, it's true

And trust in me
All my needs I will suffice
Give you such a perfect life

(Don't Go)
Let me touch you baby
(I can)
I'll make you feel alright
You really got it going on
Your love is
(Good down to the bone)
Oh the way the way you love me is incredible
Your loving must be heaven sent. Heaven sent

You give good luvin'

Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

I don't feel like bein' lonely tonight
You see, I want, I want some company
And you look like you're just my type
You're the kind, you're the kind
Whose spirits are runnin' free

Let's take a sip of some cold, cold wine
And dance to the music nice and slow
And you won't be under any kind of pressure
You see, we'll just let, we'll just let the evenin' flow

Come on and go with me
I'd sure like that, baby
Come on over to my place
It would be so nice, it would be so good
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

You look like you're just bored to death
And you wanna get away
You wanna get away from this noisy crowd
Let's go where it's nice and quiet
Where there's nobody, there's nobody else around

Let's sit by a cozy lit fire
And we can be in each other's company
Now how does that sound to you?
You see?, cause it sounds so good
It sounds so good to me

Come on and go with me
Would you do that, baby?
Come on over to my place
Would you do that, baby?
Would you do that, baby?
Come on and go with me

And I'm trying to do the best that I can
Baby, I know I was wrong
I'm so sorry, please forgive me

Forever we'll stay together, yeah

Nobody but you for me
