We got it together didn't we?
We've definitely got our thing together, don't we baby?
Isn't it nice?
I mean, really, when you really sit and think about it
Isn't it really, really nice?
I can easily feel myself slipping more and more ways
That super world of my own
Nobody but you and me
We've got it together baby

Ahh, the first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I'm like a blind man who lost his way
I can't see nothin'
I'm like a deaf man who can't relay

I can't do nothin' without my baby
And as plain as can be
It's gonna drive me crazy

I walk the lonely streets late at night

And baby, that's no lie, oh no, babe

I miss my baby's arms
His tender finger tips
Knows just how to keep me warm
It may be zero degrees
With the snow falling down
But I've got warm and tender love
Just as long as he's around
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure, baby
Can one guy bring me
Winter nights can be awful cold

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

When you pushed aside all the love I been giving

Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

And names on the door
But all I want is you, babe
Nothing more

'Cause I've got the world to hold me up
I've got the sky to keep me down
And no work on the earth is quite big enough

I fall apart While the choir sang, Hallelujah

Can't cha see I'm tryin' to show love is right
Whoa oh-oh-oh show and tell
Just a game I play when I wanna say I love you (I love you)

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's gone much too long
Any time she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know
She's gone to stay
It's breakin' me up

Never fly for the only one

Written all over me

And I owe it all to you
Your all across my loneliness
I owe it all to you
For the heartaches that I posses

Fellas I wonder would you mind if I talked to ya for a minute
You know, sometimes we have a tendencies, or should I say we forget
What a woman needs every now and then
That is, if you wanna keep your thing together
Listen to me now

Do the things that keeps the smile on her face
Say the things that make her feel better every day
Then you got to stay on your P's and Q's
If you don't, the woman you can easily lose

Oh I, oh I had a love and I lost her
And no one can help me share the pain that she caused me

Tripping on love

Plus he's got that certain drive
That I'm a victim to
Love's really got a hold on me
And there's nothing that I'd rather do

Oh, I'm right Under The Influence Of Love

Momentum relentless, so steady the senses

Bleed on my floor
And take back your old habit
Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole
Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

You're so much better than all the rest
And that's why I know I could never forget you
Where do you go once you know you've had the best

Since the beginning of time, man has been finding things.
Man has found knowledge and wisdom
and man is still trying to find his self
But among those great findings,
Baby I want you to know that I found something too
Baby I found love, when I found you

One is a lonely number, sometimes its lonely and blue
One really needs, really needs someone, girl I found you
I really do believe, I found love
Darlin' I, I found love

Change, it's time for change
Change, nothing stays the same
Change, it's time for change
Change, nothing stays the same

Something new is happening in the 80's
Just for you but you can't get lazy
All you do is just make up your mind
It's time

The key to life is your attitude
Make sure you doing what you wanna do
And watch your goals unfold right before your eyes
Yes, oh, yeah

Education don't forget it
Cause if you do, you will regret it
Technology has gone stone mad
lf you missed this that's tough to bear

But it talks no doubt about it
And push it more, nothing without it
Don't let your life just slip away
Oh, you've got to say it

Change
(You can doit, you can doit, you can do it)
Its time for change
(I can doit, I can doit, I can do it)

Change
(He can doit, he can doit, I can do it)
Nothing stays the same
(She can doit, she can doit, she can do it)

Change
(I can doit, I can doit, I can do it)
(You can doit, you can doit, you can do it)

Change

Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Bleed on my floor
And take back your old habit
Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole
Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Do the artsy thing and die

I was crazy, that's the best way to explain
How I was when I found you!
There was no way I thought I would ever change
Over those wicked things I do
But in a moment, straight out of nowhere
My wild days were over
And if you ask me why
I did it for you, did it for me
Did it for how good we could be
I did it cause you get me like no one ever did!
You took what you found, turn it around,
Flip my whole world inside out
I did it because it had to be us!
I did it for love!
Oh, oh, oh!

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon

(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

The way you move, girl, only made me want you more
I did not know you had me hypnotized
There's a movement of your body dancin' in my eyes
I know I had to hold you and make you mine

Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way

I know that, our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me baby, trust me

"Haste makes waste"

keep this in mind
"All things in time"

and all once you're there next to you
and you're burning with desire

look her right into her eyes and tell her
"Baby, I need your fire"

you've got to make sure that
it's the right night
and moonlight

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole

My first, my last, my everything.
And the answer to all my dreams.
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star.
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you.
There's no way, they could have made two
You're all I'm living for,
Your love I'll keep for evermore,
You're the first, you're the last, my everything.

I get up every morning, feeling good inside... yeah

Girl your warm as a summer breeze,
blowing gently across the sea... Yeah baby
And I'm so mad about you,
couldn't leave my life without you... No baby.

I've heard people say that too much of anything
Is not good for you, baby,
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved and
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
It's just not enough, no,
It's just not enough, oh baby

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Some things I can't get used to, no matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie, oh no, baby

Tell me, what can I say, what am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?
...

Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way

I know that, our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me baby, trust me

Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Bleed on my floor
And take back your old habit
Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole
Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Do the artsy thing and die

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

take an inventory of

When its involved with that - with that special lady or that special someone.
When I say "we all" I'm talking about all men.
All the brother's around. The Black brothers, the White brothers, the Brown brothers, the Red brothers
Because you know basically all woman are the same.
And we need to, we need to take in consideration that, that woman is
God's greatest gift to man.
And we need to take in consideration that man are then 10x they will be and they will do anything that we want em to.
You know it doesn't take much, than beautiful flowers, a simple card that says "I love you".
Somewhere to be and say "Baby I need you",
You know that's why I'm so in love and so wrapped up in you baby because, I can give you what God gave me.
The only thing that I feel that I really own is the life, that I live and to you I give this life in my love, you know why?
Just because of love I finally knew, I feel this way.
Never had a dream come true, not until the day, you came into my life.

Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way

I know that, our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me baby, trust me

You want me to win

If love is the end

Playin' your game, baby

When we met, it wasn’t quite clear to me
What you had in store was there for only me
Silly, you know you took me by surprise
Then I turned and looked, I saw that message in your eye
There you were, I fell on the floor
The way you move, girl, only made me want you more
I did not know you had me hypnotized
There’s a movement of your body dancin’ in my eyes
I know I had to hold you and make you mine
Don’t want to control you just to have a good time
In ecstasy when you’re layin’ down next to me
Oh, no, no, ecstasy, yeah, when you’re layin’ down next to me
I find it hard for me to concentrate
If I don’t make my move, girl, it might be too late
I’ve got to make sure you don’t get away
After all you done, girl, to make me wanna stay
All my life I’ve been searchin’ for a star

Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz

Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa

It's not everyday
That you can find something in your life
That is worth all the money in this world
Happiness

And for the first time in my life
I find it hard for me to express myself by the way I feel
This thing makes me wanna scream
Makes me wanna holler, makes me wanna shout
It makes me wanna sing lyrics of love
And joy and happiness and

Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way

I know that, our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me baby, trust me

Make sure you doing what you wanna do
And watch your goals unfold right before your eyes

Cause if you do, you will regret it
Technology has gone stone mad

But it talks no doubt about it
And push it more, nothing without it
Don't let your life just slip away

Did it for how good we could be
I did it cause you get me like no one ever did!

Flip my whole world inside out
I did it because it had to be us!
I did it for love!

de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon

(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

And that's why I know I could never forget you
Where do you go once you know you've had the best

Since the beginning of time, man has been finding things.
Man has found knowledge and wisdom
and man is still trying to find his self
But among those great findings,
Baby I want you to know that I found something too
Baby I found love, when I found you

One is a lonely number, sometimes its lonely and blue
One really needs, really needs someone, girl I found you
I really do believe, I found love
Darlin' I, I found love

Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Bleed on my floor
And take back your old habit
Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole
Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Do the artsy thing and die

No, you can't disguise it, I can clearly see
You want to dance with me all night long
Now you're tying to find a way to say, "Can I take you home"?

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it

Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon

Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte

Dark and lovely (You over there)
Lyrictext
I love your nature
I love, Baby I really love your eyes
Innovative lady
Believe me, you're one of a kind
You're mystifying
She's mesmerizing
Self relying
So satisfying
You're really special
And you're so unique

I love the way you're sitting there

When the temperature dips
I miss my baby's arms
His tender finger tips
Knows just how to keep me warm
It may be zero degrees
With the snow falling down
But I've got warm and tender love
Just as long as he's around
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure, baby
Can one guy bring me
Winter nights can be awful cold

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

Tripping on love

Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole

This song is for y'all
For all the times I mess up

Dear sister
Got me twisted up in prison
I miss yah
Crying
Looking at my nieces and newphews picture
They say don't let this cruel world get yah
Kinda suspicious,
Swearing one day you might leave me
for someone thats richer
Twist the cap off the bottle
I Take a sip And see tommorrow
Gotta make if I have to Beg and Borrow
Reading love letters
late night, locked down, and quiet
If brothers don't recieve their mail
Best believe we riot
Eating Jack mat
Staring at walls of Silence
Inside this cage
Where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons
Never fall for riches
Aplogizies to my TRUE sisters
Far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation
Reperations are due
Its true
Caught up in this world
I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them
Precious boys and girls
Born black in this white mans world
and all I heard was

Who knows what tommorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies

And we are happy together but

Sometimes when you're not here
And we aren't together
I, I, I just get so so hung up
mentally and spiritually too
I don't know if I going or coming
and I know that I'm, I'm a man and
I feel just like you feel

To love someone as much as I love you
To need and to want someone
As much as I want you
Sometimes it, sometimes it gets next to me baby
That's just the way it is

Is such a glory to be this way I guess
It's just when you're not here
I miss you baby

It probably doesn't mean nothing to no one else
But, I really, really wish

Could be loved as much as I love you

Baby I think we all need to
take an inventory of
our love and our feelings
When its involved with that - with that special lady or that special someone.
When I say "we all" I'm talking about all men.
All the brother's around. The Black brothers, the White brothers, the Brown brothers, the Red brothers
Because you know basically all woman are the same.
And we need to, we need to take in consideration that, that woman is
God's greatest gift to man.
And we need to take in consideration that man are then 10x they will be and they will do anything that we want em to.
You know it doesn't take much, than beautiful flowers, a simple card that says "I love you".
Somewhere to be and say "Baby I need you",
You know that's why I'm so in love and so wrapped up in you baby because, I can give you what God gave me.
The only thing that I feel that I really own is the life, that I live and to you I give this life in my love, you know why?
Just because of love I finally knew, I feel this way.
Never had a dream come true, not until the day, you came into my life.

What's happened to us, baby, what's it all about

We're getting further from each other every day
We can't just sit by and watch love walk away

Once we lose it, girl, we're gonna lose a lot

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión

Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,

Baby you know some men find it hard to express what they feel
I don't know why this is so hard
But I know a lot of them that do
I have no problem telling you how much
How much I love you how much I need you or want you
Some men are very bashful about doing certain things
Especially when it comes to making love
Hehe, you know frankly speaking I don't feel a thing
I, I just love to undress you
I just love to undress you
I think is very beautiful that a man can,
That a man can sit and watch his lady, admire her body
I mean really get into it
I want to lay down witcha babe(repeating)
There's nothing wrong with this
Hehe, is there baby, ain't nothing wrong with it
That's why you'll see me gently very gently
Taking, taking my time when I,
when I, when I slip your little panties off
Because love to me is a way of life
And baby we got all the time in the world
When we're making love, we, we never make love in a hurry
Never ever in a hurry

Without having someone other than yourself
To share what it is

de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon

(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte

Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way

I know that, our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me baby, trust me

Walking on a cloud
Feeling high
It happens every time
Whenever I'm with my guy

Tripping on love
And it feels so good
I can't help myself
And I wouldn't think I could

Plus he's got that certain drive
That I'm a victim to
Love's really got a hold on me
And there's nothing that I'd rather do

Oh, I'm right Under The Influence Of Love
And, I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm Under The Influence Of Love

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

You're the one, you're my choice for life
You, every, every bit of you, I want it all, all of you

I want your love so bad, it makes my nature ache
Oh, let me share with you whatever love it takes
I'll be your fruit, between your sheets, is what you do to me, yeah
I don't make the kind of love that's only for a minute
I'll be inside of you as long as you want me in it

Baby, 'cause I, I only want to be with you
I, oh, I, I love the things you do
I, I only want to be with you, don't matter come what may
Whatever you want, whatever you say
Whatever it is, baby, any, anything you want

Girl, in my fantasies, I see us together
I'm loving you, you're loving me, this could be forever

Hey baby, it's so good to, to just stand here, look at you
So many things are so different without you
Because there are so, so many things so right about you
Never again, baby, ever again

And I love the way you feel in my arms
Baby, no one else has ever felt like this

I've been away too long, my love
Your kiss tells me it's true
The need for you is strong my love
And I know just what to do

So just lay back and close your eyes
I wanna work this thing
Girl, I really wanna put this thing on you
You know that I can unlove to satisfy
You feel alright before this night is through

Baby's home to give you all the love you need, girl
Baby's home, don't it feel good to you like it is to me?
Baby's home, put your arms around me tight
And let me give you all that we missed

Baby's home, just stay, yeah

As the world turns from day to day
As we live we have to make decisions
And when we make those decisions
Things don't always turn out the way
We'd like them to or want them to
No matter what we feel or what seems real things change
We don't have a crystal ball to look into
To know what our fututre is going to be
Or what it gonna be
You meet someone
You care for that someone, you love that one
We made plans, we planned for so many things
Life has always been that way
So you must understand how I feel when I say we've had
our run
Good times, sad times, the fun times, the bad times
We should always remember
Thet we started as friends, there's no reason
We shouldn't end as friends
So whatever we had, we had

Whatever we had, we had

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

You, still awake my desire
And you make my love perspire
You, your passion makes me weak
I shiver down to my bare feet

I'm so glad we found each other
I'm so glad that we're together
We got something very special
I will always be so faithful

For you, you're so incomparable
Yeah, you're so sensual
You, so suave and debonair

This love, I'm talking about this love

This love will open up the door
Straight in to heaven, yeah
And if you want the heaven that we know
The heaven that we'll all get to go

You see I'm not [Incomprehensible] take you there

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

But I'm still tryna get to where I gotta be
And now I'm feelin' so close to that little dream
It's killin' me so
I'ma go escape it, I've been tapped
In a mind of a boy in a spaceship

Set free into the universe
My-my-my life and I are still doin' work
And now I'm lost, in a world of imaginary people
And I'm the one the see through

But-but-but I don't know what happend to
But I've been told, that I'm in love on my own
And I've been gone so long but

There's something that I feel we need to do
Let's take the time to try to figure out
What's happened to us, baby, what's it all about

We're getting further from each other every day
We can't just sit by and watch love walk away
If we don't try to save the love we got
Once we lose it, girl, we're gonna lose a lot

Oh, we, oh, we better, girl, try
Try to get ourselves, baby

If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby, I love you

Don't go changing, tryin' to please me
You never let me down before
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

I don't know where my baby is
But I'll find him, somewhere, somehow
I've got to let him know how much I care
I'll never give up looking for my baby
Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him
We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh, oh, so bad
And I don't think he's comin' back
He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said things he hadn't said before
And he was oh, oh, so mad
And I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

Change, nothing stays the same
Change, it's time for change
Change, nothing stays the same

Something new is happening in the 80's
Just for you but you can't get lazy
All you do is just make up your mind
It's time

The key to life is your attitude
Make sure you doing what you wanna do
And watch your goals unfold right before your eyes
Yes, oh, yeah

Education don't forget it
Cause if you do, you will regret it
Technology has gone stone mad
lf you missed this that's tough to bear

But it talks no doubt about it
And push it more, nothing without it
Don't let your life just slip away
Oh, you've got to say it

Change

Man has found knowledge and wisdom
and man is still trying to find his self
But among those great findings,
Baby I want you to know that I found something too
Baby I found love, when I found you

She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's 'I want a piece of chocolate'
'Take me to a movie'
She's 'I can't find a thing to wear'
Now and then she's moody
She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving
And she's everything I ever wanted

sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

Silly, you know you took me by surprise
Then I turned and looked, I saw that message in your eye

There you were, I fell on the floor
The way you move girl, only made me want you more
I did not know you had me hypnotized
There's a movement of your body dancin' in my eyes

I know I had to hold you and make you mine

I found out I was crying for a prize
I never thought I'd fall in love with you, no, not you
I never thought that you would love me too
When I speak of love to you
I know you wonder if it's true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too

"Hard To Believe That I Found You"
By: Barry White

Ain't it a groove?
It really is, isn't it? It really is
Baby, you know what just sitting here thinking
How happy we are right now
And the way we are with each other
The way we've been with each other
You know every now and then two people get to share to know
Love as we know it and as we share it
And I really wish...
It probably doesn't mean nothing to no one else
But, I really, really wish
That all women all over the world
Could be loved as much as I love you
That could be needed and wanted
As much as you are
You see baby, to me it's...
It's like sometimes I think to myself

Otra noche mas a solas, otra vez sin verte amor
sigo contando las horas de aquel reloj
Cada vez que sopla el viento, me parece oir tu voz
de nada sirve el lamento de mi corazon
Todavia me pregunto porque,
no podemos estar juntos, nose
sigo buscando el modo de volver a estar junto a ti
Y es que siento un gran vacio en mi sed
llevo tu olor tatuado en mi piel
sin ti vuelvo a tener miedo a caer, vuelve junto a mii
Quiero seeer, el guardián de tu sonrisa
quiero veeer, que amaneces junto a mi
tu siempre seras mi unica ilusión
mi vida estará, en tu corazon
(Diemc)
(oye princesa, esto es para ti)
Este es el momento de decirte que aunque el mundo nos separe,
sigo contando las horas para volver a besarte,
para volver a sentirte y a tenerte entre mis brazos
para volver a sentir que nada puede separarnos
Aunque estemos apartados por kilometros que crecen,
nuestro amor esta en el cielo y entre estrellas se hace fuerte
nuestra historia no podra borrarla ni el tiempo ni el viento

Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?

We were close friends
Also lovers
Did everything
For one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now

Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole

Baby I think we all need to
take an inventory of
our love and our feelings
When its involved with that - with that special lady or that special someone.
When I say "we all" I'm talking about all men.
All the brother's around. The Black brothers, the White brothers, the Brown brothers, the Red brothers
Because you know basically all woman are the same.
And we need to, we need to take in consideration that, that woman is
God's greatest gift to man.
And we need to take in consideration that man are then 10x they will be and they will do anything that we want em to.
You know it doesn't take much, than beautiful flowers, a simple card that says "I love you".
Somewhere to be and say "Baby I need you",
You know that's why I'm so in love and so wrapped up in you baby because, I can give you what God gave me.
The only thing that I feel that I really own is the life, that I live and to you I give this life in my love, you know why?
Just because of love I finally knew, I feel this way.
Never had a dream come true, not until the day, you came into my life.

Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Bleed on my floor
And take back your old habit
Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole
Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Do the artsy thing and die

Walking on a cloud
Feeling high
It happens every time
Whenever I'm with my guy

Tripping on love
And it feels so good
I can't help myself
And I wouldn't think I could

Plus he's got that certain drive
That I'm a victim to
Love's really got a hold on me
And there's nothing that I'd rather do

Oh, I'm right Under The Influence Of Love
And, I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm Under The Influence Of Love

"Hard To Believe That I Found You"
By: Barry White

Ain't it a groove?
It really is, isn't it? It really is
Baby, you know what just sitting here thinking
How happy we are right now
And the way we are with each other
The way we've been with each other
You know every now and then two people get to share to know
Love as we know it and as we share it
And I really wish...
It probably doesn't mean nothing to no one else
But, I really, really wish
That all women all over the world
Could be loved as much as I love you
That could be needed and wanted
As much as you are
You see baby, to me it's...
It's like sometimes I think to myself

Remember? (remember)

Oh what a day it was
Everything was so clear
Oh there's something about that day
I could feel it in the air
Suddenly I knew
Why I felt that way
The moment I laid eyes on you

Girl, I just had to say
Please let me be the one
You give your love to
If we live with this
Through all of this
That's how we make
Everyday anew

I'll, I'll see that face and see your smile

Open up the door

There's that look again
You know what I'm talking about
That insecure that unsure that, that wondering
Look
It's all in your eyes baby
You're sitting there and you're wondering
Does he really love me as much as he says he does?
Does he really need me and want me as much as he says he does?
Baby I can't
Sit around you twenty four hours a day telling you baby I love you, I need you and I want you
But I feel like right now right at this moment
I should try to clear and make you feel reassured about me, huh!
Woman are sensitive
Very sensitive

Sit down, right here sit down.
I wanna talk to you
There's nothing wrong
I, I'm not upset
It's nothing like that
I just got to talk to you

You see I got a problem
A real serious problem
I miss girl
Oh baby I miss you

And the funny thing about it is
We're not apart and We are together
I love you and you love me
And we are happy together but

Sometimes when you're not here
And we aren't together
I, I, I just get so so hung up
mentally and spiritually too
I don't know if I going or coming
and I know that I'm, I'm a man and
I feel just like you feel

To love someone as much as I love you
To need and to want someone
As much as I want you
Sometimes it, sometimes it gets next to me baby
That's just the way it is

Is such a glory to be this way I guess
It's just when you're not here
I miss you baby
