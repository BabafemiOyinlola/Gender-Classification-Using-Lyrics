Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Hey, girl, we're gonna take it nice and slow

Hey, girl, we're gonna take it nice and slow
Oh, girl, let it flow

I'm so glad we took the time
To look into each other's mind
We didn't grow too far too fast
And now we know each other well
The things that only time can tell
We've got a love that's gonna last

'Cause we were friends
Before we were lovers
And isn't that the way it should be, uh-huh
Baby, don't change a single thing

Let's take it nice and slow, steady as we go
From now on it's gonna be smooth, smooth sailing
Nice and slow, let it flow
And hold on tight to love

So much we have to overcome
And it looked like love was on the run

Oooh, have you ever...

You keep running, running away

If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

Can you learn to love somebody
When somebody loves you
Have you ever known that feeling

In love's endless sleep.

Every bit of you is what I need
So don't hold back, not on me

In the morning and all through the night
I move my stars by candlelight
Do me (do me again) oh yeah
Give me all your fantasies
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
Do me (do me again)

I'm Fallin In Love Again
And This Time It's Different
Cuz You See, She's My Best Friend

I Act Like I Didn't Know

So hear me out, so hear me out

Just look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see

Has nothing to do with me

Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, I thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed that you were gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away

Tonight let's take our time, erase what's on our minds
This may not come again
Gonna make this magic last, so let's not move too fast
You feel so good to me

I wanna hold you in my arms forever
Not let go of you, never
Fill me with your touch
'Cause I could never get too much

Just a little bit more (I need)
Just a little bit more
(Don't turn your back on me, don't you fall asleep)
Just a little bit more (Oh, oh)

Tonight we'll move real slow, tomorrow you will go
And I will dream of this
So let your feelings show, let your passion overflow
Give me the love I miss

I wanna hold you in my arms forever
Not let go of you, no, never
Fill me with your touch
Because I could never get enough

Just a little bit more (I need)

Ohh girl the way you do me in the morning
Ohh girl the way you love me all night long
Work my love around and make it all come down
And give me that tasty love mmmm girl
Make it feel so good only you could give me that tasty love

Verse:
Ohh girl you touch a special part of me a part no one else has ever seen
Ohh girl such a feeling that is so intense I had no defense

Girl when you're next to me your sensitivity inside you gets me yearning

Got someone else to keep you warm.
Youve been seen in cozy places,
But there's a calm before the storm.
Like he's been seen with other faces.

Folks say he changes with the night,
To break her heart is second nature.
Oh girl hell never do you right.
I'm warning you your hearts in danger,
But you can put your love on me,
And you wont be lonely.
I'll be waiting patiently... cause I love you only.

He can never love you like I do, like I do.
No hell never ever love you, baby, like I do.

Lovers Come And Then Lovers Go
That's What The People Say
Don't They Know
How It Feels When You Love Me
Hold Me And Say You Care

Seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I missed you
(I missed you too)

'Cause you, you and I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin

It's all come together
Problems we've defeated
And I'm here hand in hand
You take all that I got if you need it, baby

'Cause you, you and I-I-I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I-I-I
Back together again
...

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Come to me again
It's been to long since we had touched like this
So we jump right in
It's like caving it up again
When i'm with you baby

I don't care if you got somebody else at home
I don't care how might say that it ain't right
This is our only change to be alone
Honey you can be he's forever
But you gotta be mine tonight

Just love me down
From head to toe
Let's cherish the moment
And never let go
Just love me down
Nice and slow
When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more and some more
...

I can't believe
What is happening to me

And make me strong
Now I wanna save my world with you
[Chorus:]
For you I will

One can have a dream, baby
Two can make a dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can see how it really feels

One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make a light shine through

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy

One can be alone in a bar
Like an island he's all alone
Two can make just any place
Seem just like being at home
...

Oh it feels so good being here with you yes
Being close to you is what I wanna do yes
Just can't seem to get enough of your love, baby
The way you do the thing you do, what a rush

Every bit of you is what I need
So don't hold back, not on me

In the morning and all through the night
I move my stars by candlelight
Do me (do me again) oh yeah
Give me all your fantasies
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
Do me (do me again)

It's too strong to be questioned and it feels too good to be wrong
Whenever we touch like this
Whenever I kiss you lips
Baby my heart beats faster by the minute

Love means so many different things
But you're all that matters
And this is all I'll ever ask of you

Tell me your dreams, so they can be mine too
Let me be there to help them come true

Tell me your fears, when you feel afraid
Come to my arms let me rock them away

That's all I'll ever ask,
That's all I'll ever ask, That's all I'll ever ask

Listen lover, let me tell you
Something I've been longing to say
Lately you've been distant
Growing further every day

A heartbreak is a hard thing
And it's something we don't have to do
Girl, I'm telling you the truth
So hear me out, so hear me out

Just look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around, baby
No one's gonna love you like me

So you tell me what you're feeling
Has nothing to do with me
I know imagination's
Not getting the best of me, no

Everybody's having so much fun
Putting so much love and care
Into this special day
Everybody's giving
Giving from their hearts unselfishly
MaMa's making everyone's favorite recipe

Let Christmas slip away

Hey, girl, we're gonna take it nice and slow
Oh, girl, let it flow

I'm so glad we took the time
To look into each other's mind
We didn't grow too far too fast
And now we know each other well

We've got a love that's gonna last

'Cause we were friends
Before we were lovers
And isn't that the way it should be, uh-huh
Baby, don't change a single thing

Let's take it nice and slow, steady as we go
From now on it's gonna be smooth, smooth sailing
Nice and slow, let it flow
And hold on tight to love

They can take all of my money,
But that won't take away the pain.
The power of love around us
Beats all material things.
They can take all my possessions
And scandalize my name.
I can handle all the pressure
If your love only stays the same.
I don't want to lose your love,
(Don't want to lose your love.)
'Cause you mean the world to me.
I don't want to lose your love
(Dont want to lose your love.)
And all that we've come to be.
As we lay here together
And I'm so into you, oooooooh,
Nothing else could be better
Than the things that we do. Oooh.
Our love grows beyond measure
In love's endless sleep.
You give me so much pleasure.

Got someone else to keep you warm.
Youve been seen in cozy places,
But there's a calm before the storm.
Like he's been seen with other faces.

Folks say he changes with the night,
To break her heart is second nature.
Oh girl hell never do you right.
I'm warning you your hearts in danger,
But you can put your love on me,
And you wont be lonely.
I'll be waiting patiently... cause I love you only.

CHORUS
He can never love you like I do, like I do.
No hell never ever love you, baby, like I do.
