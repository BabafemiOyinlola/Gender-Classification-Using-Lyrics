And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

You're all I've ever wanted, (and) my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say

I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,

To tell you how I feel my love
Mere words could not explain

Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again
Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

Soon as the feet strike Zion
Lay down my heavy burden

Going home one day and tell the story

Got drained fromt the pristine fountain
Your know all of God's sons and daughters that morning
Will drink that all healing water

And we gonna live on forever

Camouflage my eyes, hustle to survive
The Less mican man stands grand
And work with two twenty five

And that's my word, we tryin' to blow like the Hiddenburg
Swerve legalize dope in the form of vinyl

Until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve to tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you

To go around the world today
And if we had a little more
You know it would be a better place
