You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?

Ben ik een onwetende wilde?
Jij bevoer de hele wereld
Je kijkt vast niet verkeerd
Toch heb ik het idee
Dat de wilde van ons twee
Degeen is die niet luistert en niet leert
Die niet leert

Jij denkt dat het land waar jij belandt van jou is
Jij plukt de aarde als een aasgier kaal
Maar ik weet elke rots en boom, elk wezen
Heeft een ziel, heeft een leven, heeft een taal

Jij noemt de mensen eigenlijk pas mensen
Als die mensen precies zo zijn als jij

I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When it's nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
Because I've got my love to keep me warm
I love the winter weather
'cause that's when you and I can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When there's ice and snow
Don't you know I'll hold you tightly to me

Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly wears the crown.

O the rising of the sun,

Sweet singing in the choir

As white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Saviour

Hail the heaven-born prince of peace
Hail the Son of righteousness

Risen with healing in His wings

Born that Man, no more may die
Born to raise the sons of Earth
Born to give them second birth

There've been times, when I thought I heard angels
And I must admit, it took me by surprise
I heard rhythm, and the fullness of life
So rich, it brought tears to my eyes

There was a time, I was sure I heard angels
It was a sound tinged with sadness, but loaded with the joy
Full of rhythm, and oh such music
Kind of streetwise jubilation at the coming of that blessed boy

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strain

If you follow the sunset, will it ever end?
Does the moonlight shine on Paris?

I knew it was there
Though I tried to hide it
The feeling just kept on shining through
Haven't known you that long
So I try to deny it
But the feeling was much, too much, too strong

Could this be love
Deep down inside
Tearing me apart
I feel it in my heart

Constantly, you're on my mind
Thinkin' 'bout you all the time
I can't sleep no matter what I do
I just keep on thinkin' 'bout you

Why do I feel this way
When I know you have someone
That you're seeing each and every day

It's hard to say from where you stand
Exactly when it all began
But someplace there's a point you cross the line
You see the tears than stain your face
Mirrored in your make-up case
And know it's time to leave this place behind

Chorus:
It's a long way home
It's a long way home
It's a long way home
Trying to retrace your steps
All too easy to forget
Just which way to go
It's a long way home

Outside the sky is threatening

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed

Those words are here in my heart
Oh, but there is just one missing part
How to put it together? How to say it right?
And let you know that every night

Hopin' baby you will be there

Boy, you've been running around too long
And I think you're running out of time
No more jumping in and out of my bed

You can call me the only one, then walk out the door

You can run around having fun and just come back for more

You're living in a fantasy, it gotta be them or me
And if you try it one more time
Baby, don't expect me to come running back

Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running

And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

Silver and gold, silver and gold
Mean so much more when I see
Silver and gold decorations
On ev'ry Christmas tree.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Here we are as in all the days
Have we gone in days of your
Faithful friends who admire to us
Gotta near to us once more
To the years we'll always be together
If the fades allowed, hmm

I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When it's nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
Because I've got my love to keep me warm
I love the winter weather
'cause that's when you and I can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When there's ice and snow
Don't you know I'll hold you tightly to me

Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmas-ing with you

Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you
All the lights on my tree

There's a star in the East on Christmas morn,
Rise up shepherd and follow.
It will lead to the place where the Saviour's born,
Rise up shepherd and follow.

Follow, follow,
Rise up shepherd and follow.
Follow the star of Bethlehem.
Rise up shepherd and follow.

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly wears the crown.

(Chorus:)
O the rising of the sun,
The running of the deer,
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the choir
Sweet singing in the choir.

The holly bears a blossom
As white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Saviour

Boy, you've been running around too long
And I think you're running out of time
No more jumping in and out of my bed
It's time for me to draw the line

(So you think that)
You can call me the only one, then walk out the door
(And you think that)
You can run around having fun and just come back for more

(I think that)
You're living in a fantasy, it gotta be them or me
And if you try it one more time
Baby, don't expect me to come running back

(Running back to you)
Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running

And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

Oh oh, oh oh

All alone, a rainy night, no one around
But I feel someone's watching me
I look around, the street is bare, nobody there
I wonder what it could be

As I turned to walk away, suddenly I saw his face
Never minding that we were alone
Didn't care about the time
At the moment I was feeling fine

I was looking into stranger's eyes
(He caught me by surprise)
They looked right through me
(He looked into my eyes)

Never knew
(Never, ever thought that love could be)
That's when he came
(He came and captured me)

Like a scene out of a dream, I can't believe it
Kind of strange and familiar
But in his eyes I get a sign, I get a feelin'
I get the feelin' he knows me

the perfect man of all for me to choose
used to a dream of such a man like you
never thought it would come true

When it's time to get up you're gonna know it
You gonna get a felling inside, you gotta show it
You come on relax and put your mind at ease
And forget all your insecurties

You gotta move, nothing can hold you down
And let nothing turn your move around
Just start counting up 2, 3
Come on people just get free

Get free
In the midst of trouble love
Get free
Gotta find you another one
Get free
Freedom

Come on people just get free
There's a chance if you open up
Get free
Freedom dance if you open up
Get free
Freedom
Come on people just

You've been holding back to long
Now the feeling is much to strong
Take a look at your other side of your heart
And begin to tear the rules apart

No your Momma can't help you now
And your Daddy can't show you how
You've gotta do it all by yourself
And if you need it here's a little help

Where could the dream have gone to
Now I know there's no way that I can make you stay
No matter how I want to

We made some memories that my heart will always treasure
Before you close the door let's make one more

Baby, just for tonight let me give myself to you
And all I ask is just for tonight love me like you used to do
And I promise that I won't cry, I won't ask you why
I won't even try to change your feelings

And we both know the score
Can we try just once more

Oh baby give me one reason
Why we shouldn't fall in love again

Dreamin', dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin'

For the life of me, I never thought that it could be
The way it stands right now
Emotions running high, every night I wish that I
I would tell you how I feel

Those words are here in my heart
Oh, but there is just one missing part
How to put it together? How to say it right?
And let you know that every night

I'll be dreamin', dreamin'
Hopin' baby you will be there
I'll be dreamin', dreamin'
Hopin' baby you will be there

Let me take time out to try and find out
If this could be real

What's the matter?
I just can't seem to make him understand
Well, did you tell him how you feel?
I tried that
But it just went in one ear and out the other
Well, why don't you show him how you feel?
Show him
Show him
Alright
Hoo..., hoo, hoo
Whoa..., oh, oh
I can't imagine
Why you're feeling sad
If you're really trying girl
To give just what you have

Got that certain kind of man
Who really needs a lot
So tell him what you'll do for him
Mmmm, mmmm
And show him what you've got

Don't you know that love is watching you
(so speak with your heart)
It's the kind of love that guides you through
(guides you through)
And you'll know just what to do
So

(If you really love him)
Then make a way
To show him what you really feel
(If you really need him)

Waitin' for my baby's car
Just then, out stepped the driver of a limousine
And asked if I was going far

I said, "I've got my mind made up
I don't want to leave here baby 'cause it's clear to me
That it's just too tough to find another lover like mine"

With the right stuff

And when the storms came through
They found me and you, ooh back together
And when the sun would shine
It was yours and mine, yours and mine forever

And oh how the years go by
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes
All through the changes the soul never dies
We fight, we laugh, we cry
As the years go by

There were times we stumbled
They thought they had us down
We came around and how we rolled and rambled
We got lost but we got found

Now we're back on solid ground
We took everything all our times would bring

There've been times, when I thought I heard angels
And I must admit, it took me by surprise
I heard rhythm, and the fullness of life
So rich, it brought tears to my eyes

There was a time, I was sure I heard angels
It was a sound tinged with sadness, but loaded with the joy
Full of rhythm, and oh such music
Kind of streetwise jubilation at the coming of that blessed boy

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strain

Haste,

These are the eyes that never knew how to smile
'Til you came into my life
(Do do do do do)
And these are the arms that long to lock you inside
Every day and every night
(Do do do do do)

Boy, and here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm tryin' to show love is right?

Whoa, show and tell just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you"
So won't you show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too?
Say you do, baby

These are the hands that can't help reachin' for you
If you're anywhere in sight

It takes L and an O and a V and an E
It takes you, it takes me together
Huh, let's love, we've only got a day
Huh, let's love to pass the time away

I, I've only known you for a moment
But I love you so desperately, boy
If it wasn't for the things that people say now
You would be making love to me, alright

Takes L and an O and a V and an E
It takes you, it takes me together
Huh, let's love, we've only got a day
Huh, let's love to pass the time away

They say that I'm cruel, that I'm evil

The moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and endless skies, my love
To the dark and endless skies

The first time ever I kissed your mouth

Come bring me your softness
Comfort me through all this madness
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again

Come give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again

I was half, not whole in step with none
Reaching through this world in need of one

You are, you are, everything, everything, oh

You are, you are, everything, everything, everything is you

Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
He walked like you do
I thought it was you
As he turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
Oh you are everything

One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy, but all I do is cry, cry
No more laughter, oh, why did he go?

Since he's left my life's so empty
Though I try to forget it just can't be done

I want to know just how you feel
Said I wanna know if what you feel is real
'Cause there is a reason for the things that I say
I wanna love you, boy, in a special way

We've been together for so very long
I would hate to break up, break up my happy home

The way we stand and the way we lie
The way we love and the way we cry
Of all these things there lies a tie
Makes me feel that it's worth a try

I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you, baby
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you

All babies together, every one a seed
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed
Oh, when will there be a harvest for the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh yeah

A nation planted so concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain
And far too many feelin' the strain
Oh, when will there be a harvest for the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh

When will there be now, how? Gather every man
And gather every woman, celebrate your lives
Give thanks for your children

Like a miracle
Baby, you are mine
And all the winds they blow us far far away
Don't you forget my promise
Listen to what I said

I remember we're miles miles apart
When you confess your heart
Telephone in hand lying in ? hotel, baby
Precious words I heard

Here we are once again, it's the same old story
You and I, me and you claiming we're just friends
When are we gonna learn that we don't have a choice?
We both know how it ends so we just choose to pretend

In a way it's all secondary for the way that things have been
We fall out of love and back in love again
We'll go round and round and still say we're just friends

Joy is the gift He brings
Joy is the song we sing
Joy may cover everything
Joy, joy to the world
Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing.
Joy to the world, the Savior reigns!
(Brian)
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.

I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When it's nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
Because I've got my love to keep me warm
I love the winter weather
'cause that's when you and I can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When there's ice and snow
Don't you know I'll hold you tightly to me

Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmas-ing with you

Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you

Follow the star of Bethlehem.
Rise up shepherd and follow.

Gotta near to us once more
To the years we'll always be together

Said the nightwind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see

A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear

A song, a song, high above the trees

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King

Hail the heaven-born prince of peace
Hail the Son of righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings

Mild He lays His glory by
Born that Man, no more may die
Born to raise the sons of Earth
Born to give them second birth

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King

How jesus the savior, did come for die
For poor orn'ry people like you and like i

With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
And high from gods heaven a starlight did fall
And the promise of ages, it then did recall

There've been times, when I thought I heard angels
And I must admit, it took me by surprise
I heard rhythm, and the fullness of life
So rich, it brought tears to my eyes

There was a time, I was sure I heard angels
It was a sound tinged with sadness, but loaded with the joy
Full of rhythm, and oh such music
Kind of streetwise jubilation at the coming of that blessed boy

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strain

What child is this, who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels
Greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?

Is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:

Haste,
Haste to bring Him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary.

And I asked the lord to help me

You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone
Where do we go from here I know
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

I was never crazy for flowers
I confess that nothing left me colder
I could watch a daisy for hours
And all I'd feel was several hours older

Lilacs or lilies, anything you please
All that they did was make me shrug or sneeze
But now I love each blossom that I see
For a lovely little rose loves me

Now my life is rosy, since I found my Rosie
With a girl like Rosie, how could I be blue?
Hand in hand we'll mosey, me and little Rosie
