Something in the way you love me
Just won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner
So baby, won't you set me free?

Stop playing with my heart, finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me let it show, baby, let me know
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand
I've given all I can
But you've got the best of me

Borderline
It feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You keep pushing my love

Through the years we've had our share of ups and downs
but I've managed to stick it out.
Spent a lot of time talking and trying
and I'm tired of going around the desperation bend.

Can't seem to get through to you
and you sure can't get through to me.
I'd rather be living on my own then to live in a state of misery.
And I...
Think it's time that I walked away
'cause I'm not the person I used to be.
'Cause I'm stronger, wiser and feeling beautiful
and I want a life...
that's beautiful.

Hasta la vista, baby

You gave me love, you did me wrong
Didn't know what to do
But baby, I'm strong, gonna get over you
A new boy I'm gonna choose, you'll see

My love was true, still you threw it all away
Now other guys will have me, they'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel

You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah

Was she hot, did she turn you out?
Curiosity rules my brain
Was she worth my heart? It's torn all apart
Are you going back again? Tell me

When I first laid my eyes upon you
I knew right then and there you were the one
Eyes so deep, you send me melting
And then you smiled as if to say, “Oh, yeah”

But then you seemed to change your mind
You looked away like you were, oh, so shy
Is the game you're playing hard to get
Won't you tell me, oh, ho

Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night

I'd like to know more than just your name
Did you come here alone or with someone?
If only you would open up
And let me know just where you're comin' from

Are you lookin' for a new love
...

I never knew what I was missing
Love with no passion in the kissing

I can't explain it, how you made me open up
And you showed me things I never thought I'd do
I'd hate to think of ever losing you
? Cause there is no one that makes me feel the way you do

You're some kind of lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kind of lover
Make me feel, oh, so real

You made a promise
That you’d never desert me
So where are you now
You built me up
Then you left me standing all alone
Lost in the crowd

My friends all say to forget you
I should but why do I hurt so

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall

Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl
Her eyes were hazel
And her nose were slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took a starry to steal my breath away
Down on the water front
Her hair all drenched in spray
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel
And her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar and she began to play
She sang a song to me
Stuck right in my brain
You're just a memory of a love
That used to be
You're just a memory of a love
That used to mean so much to me

And keeps the passion burning bright

Through the years we've had our share of ups and downs
but I've managed to stick it out.
Spent a lot of time talking and trying
and I'm tired of going around the desperation bend.

Can't seem to get through to you
and you sure can't get through to me.
I'd rather be living on my own then to live in a state of misery.
And I...
Think it's time that I walked away
'cause I'm not the person I used to be.
'Cause I'm stronger, wiser and feeling beautiful
and I want a life...
that's beautiful.

To try my love and see how well it fits
Baby can't you see, when you look at me

All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight

It's been a long while since we shared some special time alone
I think we should get away take a romantic holiday
Maybe we could take a walk stroll through a path on a beach
Spendin' time just holdin' hands – kisses just make it so complete

This time is meant to be for lovers

I was so lonely
I was left with no one to call my own
Then you came along, boy
And saved my heart from turning to stone

Baby, you and your lovely smile
Opened my heart wide as a country mile
Like a bird that had broken wings
Through you I have learned how to fly

I don't know what you do to me
When I think about you, yeah, it sets me free
I don't know what you do to me
But I'm gonna tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me

Could I be dreaming?
I don't wanna wake up and find you gone
I never imagined, baby
That I feel like a queen on the throne

Do you know what, what you do to me?
You keep me flying high on this ecstasy
When you kiss me all over
Your passion burns straight through my heart

So complete and full of fire
Have no fear, baby, I'll always be here
'Cause I wouldn't last a day without you

'Cos when we're making love
Skies above open up and set me free
And when I'm in your arms the feeling starts
Honestly, you get the best of me

In your eyes that secrets you cannot hide
So deep inside, don't fight this feeling
Words can't say, they only get in our way

No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some kind of faith, oh, yeah
No river's too wide to make it across
All you have to do is believe when you pray

And then you will see the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
Hold on your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find, You
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

How, yeah, one chance in a million the two of us would meet
We came face to face with our destiny
One glance in a thousand, of all the people on the street
Would change our lives forever and make it feel this sweet

Here we are, surrounded by a wave of love inside
Cherish me as I'll cherish you and we'll be each other's guide

You have a commitment of love that we both need so much
We're sharing something special that no one can touch
We have is the commitment of touch that is so rare to find
We've got to protect it for the rest of our lives, my darling
Is the commitment of love

Commitment of love

There's something 'bout the morning sun, a day's begun anew
Reminds me to appreciate the mystery of you
To see a bird soar in the sky I've often wondered why
We take so much for granted, we're too blind to see the view

Sometimes I lose my way
Just existing everyday
Drifting away from where my heart belongs
When my heart belongs to you

And it all begins with you
The secret of life is walking closer to the truth
Even the mountains bow to you
The stars are ornaments in the sky, they testify

When a man loves a woman
They say she could do no wrong
When a man loves a woman
Her nights will never be long

When a man loves a woman
He makes love with pure intensity
And if she wants
He’ll do what you do

When a man loves a woman
He’s not afraid of his vulnerability
When a man loves a woman
He loves their intertwining sexuality

When a man loves a woman
He might let her see him cry
And he’ll never risk losing her
By telling some stupid lie

(Men…)
He won’t do you wrong
(Men…)
He’ll love you long
(Men…)
(Men…)

When a man loves a woman
He might fly her to a night in Rome
This could happen
Though, never leaving home

When a man loves a woman
Yeah, he’ll do most anything
And with his presence
A smile he’ll surely bring

When a man loves a woman
He won’t hesitate to put her first
He’ll satisfy her desires
And quench her every thirst

Late around midnight
When you're holding me near
It feels so good to me
Feel like crying those tears

By someone you thought was really cool?
Did they steal your lover or was it money?
Or was it lies they told?

Strangers just disguised as your friends
Never again ‘cause now you know

That friends will let you down, that friends won’t be around
That friends will let you down, friends won’t be around
When you need them most, where are your friends?
Oh friends are hard to find, friends, yours and mine
I’m talkin’ ‘bout your friends

Smiles they hide behind, never know what’s on their mind
Could be true deception
Jealousy and envy reign they never want to see you get ahead
They just hold you back

Friends will let you down, friends won’t be around

Oh, friends are hard to find, friends, yours and mine

Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl
Her eyes were hazel
And her nose were slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took a starry to steal my breath away
Down on the water front
Her hair all drenched in spray
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel
And her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar and she began to play
She sang a song to me
Stuck right in my brain
You're just a memory of a love
That used to be
You're just a memory of a love
That used to mean so much to me

So you better try hard to please her

I’ll give you all of my time

Will you love me forever?

You know I like to travel ‘round the world
Taking in the globe

I knew right then and there you were the one
Eyes so deep, you send me melting
And then you smiled as if to say, “Oh, yeah”

But then you seemed to change your mind
You looked away like you were, oh, so shy
Is the game you're playing hard to get
Won't you tell me, oh, ho

Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night

I'd like to know more than just your name
Did you come here alone or with someone?
If only you would open up
And let me know just where you're comin' from

Are you lookin' for a new love

That you’d never desert me
So where are you now
You built me up

Lost in the crowd

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall

Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kind of lover
Make me feel, oh, so real

Through the years we've had our share of ups and downs
but I've managed to stick it out.
Spent a lot of time talking and trying
and I'm tired of going around the desperation bend.

Can't seem to get through to you
and you sure can't get through to me.
I'd rather be living on my own then to live in a state of misery.
And I...
Think it's time that I walked away
'cause I'm not the person I used to be.
'Cause I'm stronger, wiser and feeling beautiful
and I want a life...
that's beautiful.

Something in the way you love me
Just won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner
So baby, won't you set me free?

Stop playing with my heart, finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me let it show, baby, let me know
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand
I've given all I can
But you've got the best of me

Borderline
It feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You keep pushing my love

Friends, friends, friends
Friends, friends, friends
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Have you ever been stabbed in the back
By someone you thought was really cool?
Did they steal your lover or was it money?
Or was it lies they told?

Strangers just disguised as your friends
Never again ‘cause now you know

That friends will let you down, that friends won’t be around
That friends will let you down, friends won’t be around
When you need them most, where are your friends?
Oh friends are hard to find, friends, yours and mine
I’m talkin’ ‘bout your friends

Smiles they hide behind, never know what’s on their mind
Could be true deception
Jealousy and envy reign they never want to see you get ahead
They just hold you back

Friends will let you down, friends won’t be around
When you need them most, where are your friends?
Oh, friends are hard to find, friends, yours and mine
I’m talkin’ ‘bout your friends

Friends are hard to find, don't be scared
Friends are hard to find
Friends are hard to find
Friends are hard to find, don't be scared
What happened to the kisses and ride, how are you?

I'm so glad lookin' at the weekend
We like colorful friends
No stress, no news, just good vibes
Good food, good music and good times
All I wanna do is just dance
All I wanna do is just dance
All I wanna do is just dance
All I wanna do is just dance
Midnight lounge

Through the years we've had our share of ups and downs 
but I've managed to stick it out.
Spent a lot of time talking and trying 
and I'm tired of going around the desperation bend.

Can't seem to get through to you 
and you sure can't get through to me.
I'd rather be living on my own then to live in a state of misery.
And I...
Think it's time that I walked away 
'cause I'm not the person I used to be.
'Cause I'm stronger, wiser and feeling beautiful 
and I want a life...
that's beautiful.

Hasta la vista, baby

You gave me love, you did me wrong
Didn't know what to do
But baby, I'm strong, gonna get over you
A new boy I'm gonna choose, you'll see

My love was true, still you threw it all away
Now other guys will have me, they'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel

You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah

You know it's funny, funny how time flies
As I watch days turn into years
You never know if it will last forever
You can only try to keep it new

Late around midnight
When you're holding me near
It feels so good to me
Feel like crying those tears

I never knew what I was missing
Love with no passion in the kissing

I can't explain it, how you made me open up
And you showed me things I never thought I'd do
I'd hate to think of ever losing you
? Cause there is no one that makes me feel the way you do

You're some kind of lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kind of lover
Make me feel, oh, so real

So wine me and dine me
Treat me like a lady, yeah

I've been watching you
Watching all the girls go crazy over you
Meet me on the floor
And let's talk about the special things you do
Give me what I want
And I'll do just what you want me to do
'Cause tonight I'm hot
And baby you got something I can use

I need a love injection
A bit of your affection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
To cure up my infection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me

Give me what I miss
Let me feel your kisses in the dark
Boy, don't make me wait
Why must you keep me hanging on
I'm not hard to please
If you'll give me what I need from you

When I first laid my eyes upon you
I knew right then and there you were the one
Eyes so deep, you send me melting
And then you smiled as if to say, “Oh, yeah”

But then you seemed to change your mind
You looked away like you were, oh, so shy
Is the game you're playing hard to get
Won't you tell me, oh, ho

Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night

I'd like to know more than just your name
Did you come here alone or with someone?
If only you would open up
And let me know just where you're comin' from

Are you lookin' for a new love

Most of All

You made a promise
That you’d never desert me
So where are you now
You built me up
Then you left me standing all alone
Lost in the crowd

My friends all say to forget you
I should but why do I hurt so

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall

Too strong woah

You're too strong for me baby
I've got to learn to say no
Something's wrong with me baby
I've got to learn to say no

I try to give you up but it's hard
Playing games left a hole in my heart
You've got me doing things I can't understand
Won't someone save me take this gun from my head

You're too strong for me baby
I've got to learn to say no (ugh)
Something's wrong with me baby
I've got to learn to say no

Same situation again and again
I'll say i'm leaving I just don't know when

I want a love that's serious
No time to play love games
I don't wanna be nobody's fool
So if you wanna be with me
You gotta give it up

Real love
I know I wanna have one
Real love
Gonna try and get some

Real love
Everybody needs one

Got to have real love

No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some kind of faith, oh, yeah
No river's too wide to make it across
All you have to do is believe when you pray

And then you will see the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
Hold on your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find, You
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

I was so lonely
I was left with no one to call my own
Then you came along, boy
And saved my heart from turning to stone

Baby, you and your lovely smile
Opened my heart wide as a country mile
Like a bird that had broken wings
Through you I have learned how to fly

I don't know what you do to me
When I think about you, yeah, it sets me free
I don't know what you do to me
But I'm gonna tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me

Could I be dreaming?
I don't wanna wake up and find you gone
I never imagined, baby
That I feel like a queen on the throne

Do you know what, what you do to me?
You keep me flying high on this ecstasy
When you kiss me all over
Your passion burns straight through my heart

But it's the only thing that I know

You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
