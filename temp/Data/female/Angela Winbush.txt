A dee dee dee dee doo doo

I was a victim of my foolish thinking
Carelessly I've risked my love and my life
There's no self-pity, I admit I obliged
Overpowered by love I pretended to be blind

Faith has survived all the doubts I've summoned
My heart has stood all the failure and loss
Helpless I cannot further be driven, ooh, ooh

I've learned to respect
The power of love
I've learned to respect (Oh)
The power of love

I've learned to respect (Ooh)
The power of love
I've learned to respect (Oh)
The power of love

I was always afraid of being the one left hurt
Running away from the one thing
for which I've always yearned
I'm not ashamed to tell you
many nights I've tossed and I've turned

I've learned to respect (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The power of love
I've learned to respect (Oh)
The power of love (Yes, I did)

I've learned to respect (Oh ooh)
The power of love (Woo, woo, woo)

Silhouette
Of a perfect frame
Shadows of your smile
Will always remain
Beginner's luck soon
Fades away, oh, baby
We go on
I will always stay

Long as I live
(Long as I live
you will be my first love)
My first love
(Girl, oh)
Long as I live
(You will by my first love)
My first love
(And I'll choose you again)

I'll keep
An old candy-coated Valentine

A time for us, I melt with love
When your lips kiss, silent words
Move the earth and shake my world

Oh, if anything I miss (Your smile)
Never could resist (Your smile)

A sweet caress that soothes all pain
When I'm lost and feelin' low
To you I go to rise again

I'll be good
Good, good, good
I'll be good
Good, good, good

Flash, we meet
Passin' in the streets
Words unspoken
Silence unbroken, hey

Just by chance
We fell into romance
The cry of success
Left no room to guess

Oh, no (oh, no)
Love has knocked us
Down and scored
We've been twice
Around the block before
Know the changes
You've been through
My promise is to you

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (ojoh, ooh)
Better than before
You know
I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know
I'll love you more

I fell in love so quick

You don't have
To cry, cry, cry, cry alone
'Cause I'll be right
By your side
To help you be strong
Baby, dry your eyes
Please be strong
I can pull these times
And help you hold on

I've been on standby
Waiting for your call
I'll catch any teardrop
Before one can fall

I'll never deceive you
The way others did
I've got what you need, girl
And so much to give

You don't have
(Don't cry, lady)
To cry, cry, cry, cry alone
I'll be right by your side
You've found a new home

And works it all night long
Her love is slow and slick
Told me don't come too quick
