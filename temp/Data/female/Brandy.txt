(1st verse: Brandy)

Oh yeah ooh yeah
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

(2nd verse: Mc Lyte)

Yeah I get exotic with tha malotic tune I get hypnotic with tha room
but you got to put me down soon I flip a sideshow
if you come my way up down and around even sideways
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get we can go all out
I ain't afraid of the sweat but yet I bet you got the techniques
to freak a girl inside out what's that all about(oooh yeah)
Can I have some of that you got to put me on word around town
is your nine men strong I wanna be put on in tha worst way since
the first day I think it was a Thursday (oh baby) you be that brother
that I wanna sink my teeth in make me wanna ask where tha hell you been
I like the way you be with all that personality but I got flava too you needs
to get with me

That your the kind of guy that I should make a move on

And if I don't let you know, then I won't be for real

The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

I wanna be down with what you're going through

No matter the time of day or night it's true

What's a sunny day without you?
Just another twenty four that passes by
What's a sunny day without you?
Just another twenty four that passes by

As I sit upon the grass in the shade
I reminisce on what we had
The romance that we shared strolling through the park
Two people in love, walking hand in hand

But now that you're gone I feel so alone
All I do is think of you
Till the day you return
It doesn't mean a thing

What's a sunny day without you?
Just another twenty four that passes by
What's a sunny day without you?
Just another twenty four that passes by

It's funny how you learn from your mistakes

Sit and talk face to face

Him for your man are you insane?

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
'Cause you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make
It through the day, ain't that a shame

But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna take his time and that's all good

Just one of those days to ya, you said the right things
To keep me movin', to keep me goin' strong

Whatever you want, I got it, Papi
Don't hesitate, holla at me
What I'm lookin' for
Is simple, you see
Love and support and sexuality
When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave
I need you just like air that I breathe
But when I'm not with you, I'm missing my peace
I got a lot inside I need to release

You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher

You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back

I was just a girl
innocent like a dove
i was just a girl
with no thoughts of making love
i was just a girl
when holding hands was enough
i was just a girl
a man didnt mean as much

Now i'm a woman, a passionate woman
now i'm a woman, a true leading woman
now i'm a woman, a sensual woman
now i'm a woman, a woman, a woman
I was just a girl
when flirting was all it was
i was just a girl
and kept feelings bottled up

i was just a girl
never knew how to touch
i was just a girl
when love didn't mean as much
Now i'm a woman, a passionate woman
now i'm a woman, a sensual woman
now i need someone who has something in common
now i need someone, someone, someone

He dont have to makes lots of cheddar
and you dont' have to write love letters
and you dont have to fool with the fellas

Feel me

We have rise to the occasion, c'mon
Like this, talk to 'em, ahh

I could've stayed in that place too long
I would've made it okay for you to do me wrong
I would've played the role one more day
If I didn't hear my conscience say
(Talk to 'em)

Stop, look around
(Yeah)
Is this where you belong?
(Oh, yeah)
Look at yourself
Are you weak? are you strong?
(Oh, no no)
I realize that it's all up to me
(Yeah)
To make myself happy
(C'mon)

Finally I walked away

Never would've seen this day

Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today

Never would've seen this day

Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today

Lookin' back on my choices made

I wonder sometimes why my love didn't turn to hate
Then I hear the same little voice inside me say

Stop, look around

Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come to see me.
You say that you're too busy.
What the hell I don't have time.
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy,
Someone who will treat me right.

I don't need this bullshit.
I won't put up with this any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity
I will be just fine if you decide
That you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what:

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?

What about, what about, what about us?

'Cause I don't wanna sound familiar
Want a guaranteed single, not an album filler

Timbaland you know how to bang the club
Give my people something to shake their butts

Almost doesn't count

Almost heard you saying
You were finally free
What was always missing for you, baby
You'd found it in me
But you can't get to heaven
Half off the ground
Everybody knows

Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come to see me.
You say that you're too busy.
What the hell I don't have time.
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy,
Someone who will treat me right.

I don't need this bullshit.
I won't put up with this any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity
I will be just fine if you decide
That you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what:

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about, what about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?

Thought you said you were different

You and your mans and them just Took over the floor
Started doin' your thang
And it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around and looked at me, it seemed as though
You must've somehow felt me starin' on the low
Somethin' tells meYou're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

Why is this the first time that I'm seein' you around
Could you be visiting or are you new in town
Yeah, whatever the case
I'm feeling you right here and right now

Your smile and all the love you showin' lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special

Is it my turn to fictionalize my world
Or even imagine your emotions to tell myself anything?
Is it my turn to hold you by your hands
Tell you I love you, and you not hear me?
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing?

Somethin' tells meYou're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

Why is this the first time that I'm seein' you around
Could you be visiting or are you new in town
Yeah, whatever the case
I'm feeling you right here and right now

Your smile and all the love you showin' lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special

And I love you baby
And I, and I love you baby
And I love you baby
And I, and I love you baby
And I love you baby
And I, and I love you. and I love you

An angel has always been thought
To be one of God's most precious works
I guess that's how she had you fooled
'Cause she was an angel in disguise
Hurt and pain could never come from her
So you left me only to find that
Hurt and pain involves her
But now you see your mistakes
And now you see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
See baby my love is true
And most importantly, still I love you
Still I love you

An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain but
Still I love you
Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain but
Still I love you

I found it quite strange
The way you said her name

Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh-huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah you do to, but um
I just wanted to know do you know somebody named
You know his name

Oh yeah, definitely, I know his name
I just want to let you that he's mine
No, no, he's mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane?

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
'Cause you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make
It through the day, ain't that a shame

But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna take his time and that's all good
All my love was all it took
(The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough
(Enough)
It's not hard to see

Who would ever thought a guy would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I would fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we would finally come to be
I guess they just don't know how much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they would have some words to say
We'll go on anyway, it's alright, it's okay
Take whatever comes our way together we will stay
I got three words to say, "Never say never"

I can't believe they stopped our happiness
By tryin' to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all this crazy madness?
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and take my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby they can't believe that you and me are together
That's why they should have never, never said never
There were times when we thought that
You and me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never said never said never

Don't know what she was thinking 'bout?
While you were giving love
She let you down

Boy I know that you want to be alone
'Cause she broke your heart and she sent you home
And you're wondering why
She was so cold

Well then they lie, they have to lie again
'Cause the lying never ends, so

I had a dream, a crazy vision
It may sound strange, this intuition
But it was true beyond description
And somehow I knew that it was real
When I saw

One sky above, there is just one source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice
I'll sing it from the heart
One song, one voice

I've seen the fires of deep division
The hearts of stone, the cold ambition
But I have found my sacred mission
To live in this world and still believe
That there is

One sky above, there is just one source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice
I'll sing it from the heart, one song, one voice

A song that heals
A melody of reason and freedom
With words that will speak for the weak
The hopeful and the strong
Sing it for everyone

Cause there is one sky above
There is just one source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice
I'll sing it from the heart, one song, one voice

Yes there is one sky above
One source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice
So sing it from the heart, one song, one voice

Sing it with one song
One voiceOne sky above, there is just one source of love
If I've got one chance, one choice

Let go of that habit

Feels like the beginning
'Cause now I'm content with me

Been through it, you name it
The heartache and break
The shamed played that game

But I, couldn't seem to win

Something was wrong with me
Till I was finally introduced to happy

I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true

Cause the whole world is freezing

I kept asking God why
And now I’m receiving abundance of love
And I get it,
But never could imagine it

Never in my wildest dreams, no, no, no
Did I think someone could care about me, oh
Not just the way you love me
You know I’m emotional (sometimes)
Not in, not in, not in, not in my wildest dreams
Never in my wildest dreams (never in my life)
Did I think someone could care about me
(It’s so beautiful)
Not just the way you love me

Oh, never, hey
Never, oh, never hey

Out of an unknown place
Kinda like left field
You came in my life and helped me heal
Just in the nick of time
When I lacked the will to keep on moving on
You’ve been in my dreams, but from now
Couldn’t figure out the reasons
I kept asking God why
And now I’m receiving abundance of love
And I get it,
But never could imagine it

Ah baby
Ah baby

I'm sick cause it's 4 in the morning
And I'm sick cause I ain't heard from him
I done seen this flick before
G-g-g-gave him plenty warning
He said he wouldn't do it a-gain
You know my heart keeps telling me it's gon stop
Now there's a knock but the dead bolts lock
(My-my-my conscious saying)
You can do better girl
Cause right now he ain't ready
But the other side of my head side is saying
That I might not find no better
So when he a-a-ask just how could you love somebody so ooh
This feeling this question I asked still been unanswered
But is so ooh ooh so many
Yeah e yeah

Sick
When you take him back every time
Cause the love is so amazing
And it makes you so sick
When it makes you go and compromise
Everything you said the night before
You wouldn't do ooh
Sick
When you love him more than you love yourself
You can't let go
Cause you just can't help it
Cause the only left to do is cry
Cause deep inside
It makes you so sick
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Don't sometimes it makes you so

My baby got a lot to learn
Come here let mama bring you up to speed
A couple of changes and couple of things
I want to go over
A couple of hours is all I need
So let's get it started

I love the way you're touching all over my body
Kissing and licking upon me
I know you want to beat up but
But I'm sorry That ain't really my thing
If you take your time than we can do whatever
What you think we're in here for?
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
You gonna get the reaction you want

Just take it

Thinking I'd be playing, you'll be saying I'm into you.
Just take a second, and listen
Cause I ain't into lying, don’t trust anybody,
Maybe I ain't trying to kill my body so soon.
Let me know you’re worth it
Do you deserve a chance to.?
To touch, to feel my love

Cause ain’t nobody perfect
I don’t need a surface
Can you show me your love?

And when it’s time
I won’t even have to tell you so
You’ll see the stars are shinin the same
So take your time
Cause love ain’t got nowhere to go
It will be waiting there if we wait
Cause there’s no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait

But my love was never misplaced
See baby my love is true
And most importantly Still I Love You

Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And the whole hood's buzzin'

It's us against them you'll see
Hey, hey, hey, they ain't gon' stop
They just want what we got

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love?
When they don't know one thing about us
And then they just runnin' they mouths
All we do is tune them out

I swear they got some nerve
Spreading what they heard
I can't give them no words

I can't be concerned

Oh yeah ooh yeah

I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

Yeah I get exotic with the melodic tune
I get hypnotic with the room but you got to put me down soon
I flip a sideshow if you come my way
Up down and around even sideways
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get
We can go all out I ain't afraid of the sweat
But yet I bet you got the techniques to freak a girl inside out
What's that all about?

Can I have some of that you got to put me on?
Word around town is your nine men strong
I wanna be put on in the worst way
Since the first day I think it was a Thursday
You be that brother that I wanna sink my teeth in
Make me wanna ask, "Where the hell you been?"
I like the way you be with all that personality
But I got flava too you needs to get with me

I wanna be down with what you're going through
I wanna be down, I wanna be down with you

Seems like ever since, the first day we met
There is no one else I think of more than you
Can't seem to forget, can't get you out my head
Cause the verdicts in I'm crazy over you
How can one be down, tell me where to start
Cause everytime you smile, I feel tremors in my heart
I have but one concern, how can I get with you
Til my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do

Be sittin up in my room
Back here thinkin bout you
I must confess, I'm a mess for you
Be sittin up in my room
Back here thinkin bout you
I'm just a mess with a thing for you

Mase get Harlem on the rise
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I went from helly hanson to mini mansions
The girls in Aruba doing belly dancin'
Spent half of my advance on jars from Branson
To make it through my circumstances
But you know I'm wiser now
Move like Tarzan now
Got a butter soft cover just to hide my pound
Got a house in the valley come and find me now
Got enough dough to buy the town
So I might give a six to my chick
Benz to my mom
Crib so big it look like the cenedome
Give her a couch just to spill Henney on
And been a don since lotto's and Benneton

[Brandy]
Some people say that I am not the same girl
They say I think that I am in my own world
What makes them think that I have changed, yeah
A little dough cannot erase my problems
im just like you I have to try and solve them
Yes everything is quite the same

I'm just trying to be me
Doing what I got to do
Some people think that I'm
Just sittin' on top of the world
I'm just trying to be me
Proving what I've got to prove
Some people think that I'm
Just sittin' on top of the world

Sittin on top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world

I wonder why it's often said that my life's
A fairy tale and everything is so right

It was your eyes that gave you up through that stupid disguise
You tryin' to hide behind your drink and you almost slipped by

Mouth might be closed, but listen baby, your heart, it is screaming

We're unbreakable, unbreakable, inseparable, inseparable.

When you say jump, I'll say how high, how high, how high,
I want to touch the sky.
When you say jump, I'll say how high, how high, how high,

I see the cloaks on the judges, flaws in the judgement, beast in the dungeon that dont scare me
And I'll say it on a mountain, say it all in public, hold a press conference to speak about my freedom

Just us - lookin' upon a city of towers soaring
Just us - standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us - I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us - Freedom

Is simple, you see
Love and support and sexuality
When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave
I need you just like air that I breathe
But when I'm not with you, I'm missing my peace
I got a lot inside I need to release

You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher

You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'

Who would ever thought a guy would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I would fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we would finally come to be
I guess they just don't know how much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they would have some words to say
We'll go on anyway, it's alright, it's okay
Take whatever comes our way together we will stay
I got three words to say, "Never say never"

I can't believe they stopped our happiness
By tryin' to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all this crazy madness?
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and take my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby they can't believe that you and me are together
That's why they should have never, never said never
There were times when we thought that
You and me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never said never said never

Who would ever thought a guy would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I would fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we would finally come to be

I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

Yeah I get exotic with the melodic tune
I get hypnotic with the room but you got to put me down soon
I flip a sideshow if you come my way
Up down and around even sideways
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get
We can go all out I ain't afraid of the sweat
But yet I bet you got the techniques to freak a girl inside out
What's that all about?

Can I have some of that you got to put me on?
Word around town is your nine men strong
I wanna be put on in the worst way
Since the first day I think it was a Thursday
You be that brother that I wanna sink my teeth in
Make me wanna ask, "Where the hell you been?"
I like the way you be with all that personality
But I got flava too you needs to get with me

I wanna be down with what you're going through
I wanna be down, I wanna be down with you

You and your mans and them just Took over the floor
Started doin' your thang
And it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around and looked at me, it seemed as though
You must've somehow felt me starin' on the low
Somethin' tells meYou're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

Why is this the first time that I'm seein' you around
Could you be visiting or are you new in town
Yeah, whatever the case
I'm feeling you right here and right now

Your smile and all the love you showin' lets me know that you

Then all your homies jumped in
And the whole hood's buzzin'

It's us against them you'll see
Hey, hey, hey, they ain't gon' stop
They just want what we got

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love?
When they don't know one thing about us
And then they just runnin' they mouths
All we do is tune them out

I swear they got some nerve
Spreading what they heard
I can't give them no words

Spent half of my advance on jars from Branson

Got a house in the valley come and find me now
Got enough dough to buy the town

Give her a couch just to spill Henney on

Nicked Volkswagen badges I'm a Beastie Boys son
Me so horny, me so young and I still get my washing done

Rhythm was a dancer
Any room for a chancer? That's me in the corner, thanks sir!

Before I was 'avin it, 'avin it large
They nicked the bmx from out my garage
Knew it was Theo from off the estate 'cause every time he'd see me, he'd smile like we were mates
From then on in I'd have to walk to me Nan's
And I'd dream my dreams through a sea of prams

You just came into my world
A little boy without a girl
You just smiled at me
I knew it was on
We spent weeks that were a blur
We made love so sweet and pure
Then I knew you were gone
Where is the man I've come to know?
With the heart I thought was gold
You just turned me out and walked out the door
How could you just be so cold?
What a hard and heavy blow
...

We were once closer then close
No one could tell 
Who loved each other the most
It was a beautiful thing
Then everything around us
Started to change
As did we
Who's to blame?
I remember it

Like it was yesterday
It's on continuous play
In my mind, in my mind
All of the good times we had
Suddenly turn bad
So bad

How did we go
From being in love
To barely speaking
What became of us?
How did we loose our way

And when I turned and look at you, you tried
To play it off but I can tell that you two were friends (ah)
She was just too nervous
She was lookin' like she was hurt
Like the memory had surfaced (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It kinda got her pissed (Yeah, yeah)

I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world
Or even imagine your emotions to tell myself anything?
Is it my turn to hold you by your hands
Tell you I love you, and you not hear me?
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing?

I am missing something in my life
And I'm trying to find what is already deep inside
Now for a while I've thought the love inside me needs
A mirrored personality that's why I'm searching

All I ever wanted was somebody to love me
Close to my heart
Able to give a piece of myself
I wanna fall in love
All I ever wanted was somebody to know me inside and out
All of my feelings
What I'm about
I wanna fall in love

La la la la
La la la
La la la
La la la la
La la la
La la la

No matter what people say
I wanna fall in love
And offer what's inside of me
I wanna give a piece of me
But never lose a thing
Because of what he gives me
I wanna fall in love

All I ever wanted was somebody to love me
Close to my heart
Able to give a piece of myself
I wanna fall in love

Now a few years later

How we got to where we are

How'd you do it (Hey...)
How did you get me so open
Baby, you have
Got me feenin', got me jonesin'
For your kisses (Yeah, yeah)
They're so rich and chocolate coated
Maybe this is (Oh, oh)
Close to heaven as I'm gon' get

Every time the phone rings
I rush to answer hopin' that it's you, yeah, yeah

'Cause you're my boo

And I'll do anything that pleases you

With you is where Id rather be,

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I went from helly hanson to mini mansions
The girls in Aruba doing belly dancin'
Spent half of my advance on jars from Branson
To make it through my circumstances
But you know I'm wiser now
Move like Tarzan now
Got a butter soft cover just to hide my pound
Got a house in the valley come and find me now
Got enough dough to buy the town
So I might give a six to my chick
Benz to my mom
Crib so big it look like the cenedome
Give her a couch just to spill Henney on
And been a don since lotto's and Benneton

You must have somehow felt me starin' on the low

Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that, I'll make everything okay
Think of me baby in anyway, I'll be all you need
Let me be the one, you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all away
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place, 'cause it's all in me

Abdullah Faizi, Eieiei!"

Strophe 2:
Aber ist mir egal, ist mir egal
Gronkh in Minecraft, mach das doch mal!
Ausnahmsweise haben wir es mal so geschafft
Duschen und sowas find' ich ekelhaft
Der Hip-Hop der alte Sack,
ich glaub das liegt an Honeyballs Texturenpack
Glauben kannst du in der Moschee!

"Erde haben wir dabei,
darum bin ich heut' so frei.
Darauf wette ich ein Ei!
Da bin ich ja relativ schmerzfrei.

I I I I I I I I I didn't want to have to say this to you
It's not that I don't love you
I just can't be explaining to everyone why you hurt me
That's why I want to keep us between you and me
You'd understand if you were treated like me
It's not that people run me but they can see
When I am hurtin' they know it's not me
So don't make me the blame, you need to change

You say later, you're not ready
To make a commitment to me
It will take some time
Should've known before we started
You act one way when you are around me
When we are in public you are so different
I know that you treat me bad but I can't get away
Let's just keep it undercover
I don't wanna be embarrassed so

I don't want anybody to know
Anybody didn't we decide that?
We don't want anybody to know
Anybody what we do when we're alone
We don't want anybody to know
Anybody didn't we decide that?
That we we don't want anybody to know
Anybody what we do when we're alone
We don't want anybody to know

I know that people would never understand me
'Cause they can only judge whatever they see
And I know what they'll say if they look at me
If I had all the answers to what they would ask
Still they wouldn't realize the love that we have
So now I have to deal with living secretly
'Cause to me love is worthless with no you and me
And it should be clear how I ride for you but

You say later, you're not ready

Hey, love is everything, and without it I'm nothing (Nothing, nothing)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Nobody knows the pain I feel
Nobody knows but it's for real
I can feel it (yeah yeah) I do
Nobody knows that I miss you
Nobody knows but it's the truth
I can feel it (yeah yeah) I do

You cannot pretend that I don't even matter
You and I know better
You've been away from me for too long
It's time for you to come on home
No one can say what is right for me
They don't have to live my life
I need for you to come on over
I'll be waiting

I am nothing without you baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone
Nothing, without you baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone

Don't tell me u want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
don't say goodbye, this can't be it
Baby please, cuz it's not worth it

(on the phone)
Baby, we wanted too much to just walk out on eachother
I just, I just think we really need to think about it before we say...
Please, it's just not worth it
It's not worth the pain
It's not worth the waitin'
It's not worth it to walk away
It's not worth it, think about it.

U came into my life and it's so funny
how u made everything right
and now u're saying to me
something ain't right
what did I do?
Did I hurt u?
Baby can u tell me
how to dry ur eyes
Let me say,
I never meant to make u cry
If anything, I meant to
be right by ur side
How did I go wrong?
When my love is strong
and all it ever wanted was u

If I can ease the pain
whatever it takes to,
that is what I'll do

It's the only explanation
To the question at hand
Like years of pain gone away
In a single day
There's nothing that compares
To the way
You make me feel inside
And I'm so glad you're my...

Prince charming, my angel
My king and my friend
My lover, my one
He is, he is
The beat in my heart
The kiss on my lips
My lover, my one
He is, he is

I know that it's late, and maybe I shouldn't be so into you
It's just that tonight, I am so taken I'm fallen for you
When I look in your eyes, I can see a million possibilities
And I know you'll be leaving me soon, but tonight

Come a little bit closer, let me hold you baby
I will be good to you, and we can try

To forget tomorrow, make it last forever, tonight

So if you must go, know that I'll be missing you wishing you closer

Oh, I believed in us
Tell me what are you thinkin'?
Why can't we make it?
Why would you say those things to me?
If you're trying to break this
Just go ahead and say it
(If you are in love then why let it go?)
Tell me please, what's happened, baby?
Oh oh

It used to be that
 (Be that)
You couldn't live without me
 (Without me)
But now you think
 (But now you)
You're better without me
 (So now)
So now it's over
 (You can see)
And I guess it wasn't true
 (Ho ho)
When you said I love you
 (I just wanna know)
Because love just wouldn't count me out

I believed in everything you said
If your vow couldn't make it
You shouldn't have made it
How could you let me believe
You couldn't leave me
If you never loved me
(If you are in love than why let go?)
Tell me please, what's happened baby?

No more sittin' at home at night
Waiting for you to come home
No more will I cry for you
I've found somebody new
No more late night phone calls
Don't even bother at all
When I was there for you
You took me for granted

Now he loves me
The way, I wanted you to love me
He is always thinkin' of me
He is notin' like you at all
I don't know why
I stayed with you for so long
I should have been gone
He is nothing like you at all

Thats why I say, "Wow"
Never felt a love so good
I looked up and my world is brighter now
There's no more rainy clouds
Since loves here and now
Everyday I wear a smile
He came in my life and the clouds are gone
I only see the sun

He is here and all my hurt is gone
