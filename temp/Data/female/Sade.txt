You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that

I'll tell you, you're right when you want
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
If only you could see into me

Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
When you're on the outside, baby, and you can't get in

When you hold me
Oh oh, when you hold me
The sound

Is it possible I could feel this cool
I could really love you the way I do
Is it possible I could feel this good
I could really love you the way I do

See me (Within the light)
Flowing (Take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (Pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

I feel a love light rush over me
I feel the love turn to me
And then your love just creeps over me
Over

I'm crying everyone's tears
And there inside our private war
I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I suppose to do

I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothing would change, nothing would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothing's any good

The dj's playing the same song
I have so much to do
I have to carry on

Needed a savior
Someone to pull me
Through somehow

So I'm counting on you now

Somebody already
Broke my heart
Somebody already
Broke my heart

Here I am
So don't leave me stranded

i see them gathered see
them on the shore
i turned to look once more
and he who knows me not takes me to the belly
of darkness

the tears run swift and hard and when they fall
even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
there was a time
when i thought
i would have to give up
but i'm thankful that i'm
strong as i am and i'll try to do
the best i can

tears will run swift and tears will come that fall like rain
i pray that it's swift though tears will fall as cold as pain

you take it ever so slow
and then you lose it, then it flows right to you

so we rely on the past
special moments that last
were they as tender as we dare to remember
such a fine time as this
what could equal the bliss
the thrill of the first kiss
it'll blow right to you

it's never as good as the first time

Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air

And so love grew a flower

Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you, oh boy
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you?

You gave me your soul for at least a day
Listen boy, there was a time when I wanted you to stay
You'll know the cost, it's you who's gonna pay

Sally
You opened out your arms
To all those young men
And girl you had room
For every one of them
You're the only girl on bowery and third
Sure as hell you're the one who cared

So put your hands together for Sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for them
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world one angry day, in New- York

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen
Soot suit and shinny shoes
He ran around town and through his methylated laughter
Most of his memories drowned

I know that lately
Things haven't been so good
I always said
If I could ever help you, I would
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, I'm here
To wipe away the tears
I will be your friend till the end of time
I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile
When you're falling apart
I pick up each piece and build a wall around your dreams
The punches to your heart
Melt away when you never thought they'd heal
So trust in me
These are the words I tattoo on you

Got a bullet to spare to kill my desire
Who's calling the shots
One of us must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease
I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts

One of us (one of us) must end this masquerade
To have or to have not
Let's heal the wounds that we've made
It's a war of the heart

Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right

Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
We're as tender as we dare to remember

Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss?
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

It's never... as good as the first time
Never... as good as the first time

We were waiting for the bus
No one much around but us
Then I see this young boy
Caught a look at me

I'm stunned in a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way

She liked his eyes, she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care

That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Even to the angels it may sound like a lie

In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love

Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious

So if you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow

Gotta stick together
Hand in glove
Hold tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love

Be brave when the journey is rough
It's not easy when you're in love
Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough
It's not easy don't give up

Changed come and strangle it
It was bound to die

You opened out your arms
To all those young men
And girl you had room
For every one of them
You're the only girl on bowery and third
Sure as hell you're the one who cared

So put your hands together for Sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for them
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world one angry day, in New- York

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen
Soot suit and shinny shoes
He ran around town and through his methylated laughter
Most of his memories drowned

Melt away when you never thought they'd heal

I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile
When you're falling apart
I pick up each piece and build a wall around your dreams
The punches to your heart
Melt away when you never thought they'd heal
So trust in me
These are the words I tattoo on you

Why can't we live together
Tell me why, tell me why
Why can't we live together

Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together

No more war, no more war, no more war
Just a little peace
No more war, no more war
All we want is some peace in this world

If I tell you
If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me
If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me

You give me you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me you give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

There's a quiet storm and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm that is you...
There's a quiet storm and you never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me

You give me the sweetest taboo

Thank you
Some will tell you that you're wrong
Do it all the wrong way

They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Don't let them get to you no-no
They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Oh no no

Don't walk round with a frown
Oh no (no)
Keep looking
It's no use sitting around
Your head in your hands
Oh no (no)

He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

Diamond life, lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator

Changed come and strangle it
It was bound to die

In the frontline of this battle of mine

For every one of them
You're the only girl on bowery and third
Sure as hell you're the one who cared

So put your hands together for sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for sally
She's the one who cared for them
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares

Thirsty world one angry day, in New York

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen
Soot suit and shinny shoes
He ran around town and through his methylated laughter
Most of his memories drowned

Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you he led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart all the way
How many tons of love inside I can't say

When I was led to you I knew you were the one for me
I swear whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

You wrapped me up in the colour of love
You gave me the kiss of life

You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

I cherish the day
Won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air

Show me how deep love can be

You're ruling the way that I move
I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
Rescue me
This is my prayer

I cherish the day
Won't go astray

There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave

She cries to the heaven above

I was so in love with you
You rarely see a love that's true
Wasn't that enough for you
Wasn't that enough for you
I would climb a mountain
I wouldn't want to see you fall
Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun
Hit me like a slow bullet

Mama been laid off
Papa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh, can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
Ooh, they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

Papa been laid off

We gotta give them a chance
It's gonna come back on everyone
If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

Still looking for the life
The endless pool on the other side

I'm doing my best

I'm at the borderline of my faith
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
In the frontline of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

I'm a soldier of love.
Every day and night
I'm soldier of love
All the days of my life

I've been torn up inside (oh!)

So I ride
I have the will to survive

In the wild wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

We were waiting for the bus
No one much around but us
Then I see this young boy
Caught a look at me

I'm stunned in a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way

She liked his eyes, she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care

That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Even to the angels it may sound like a lie

And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache

Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby?

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
Gave you love

I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

Mama been laid off
Papa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh, can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
Ooh, they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

Papa been laid off
Mama been laid off
Billy can't get a job
For too long, too long
Don't let them lose
We gotta give them a chance
It's gonna come back on everyone
If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

Heavy with the burden of the truth
And he spoke of his dreams
Broken by the burden
Broken by the burden of his youth

There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky it's the colour of love

Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you he led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart all the way
How many tons of love inside I can't say

When I was led to you I knew you were the one for me
I swear whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you

You wrapped me up in the colour of love
You gave me the kiss of life

You rarely see a love that's true
Wasn't that enough for you
Wasn't that enough for you
I would climb a mountain
I wouldn't want to see you fall
Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun
Hit me like a slow bullet

Diamond life, lover boy.
We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.
City lights and business nights.
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights.

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance.
No place to be ending but somewhere to start.

No need to ask.
He's a smooth operator,

Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk she knew
how to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down

Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that?
Do you really want to know she said?

I turned to look once more
And he who knows me not
Takes me to the belly of darkness

The tears run swift and hard
And when they fall
Even, even the comfort of a stone
Would be a gain
There was a time when I thought
I would have to give up
But I'm thankful that I'm
Strong as I am and I'll
Try to do the best I can

Tears will run swift
And tears will come that fall like rain
I pray that it's swift though
Tears will fall as cold as pain

In the frontline of this battle of mine

I'm a soldier of love.
Every day and night
I'm soldier of love
All the days of my life

Took the shelter out of my life
Took the shelter of a lie

i saw a picture
how could you be so careless
how could you have done that
to us
and i write this letter
i send it all back to you
and every word you said

in there every word
oh oh
how could you have done that to us

you treated me like a stranger
and all the time i was loving you
all your slick moves they were once innocent moves
i wanted to look up to you
i really trusted you
and every word you said

Oh oh, when you hold me

Is it possible I could feel this cool
I could really love you the way I do
Is it possible I could feel this good
I could really love you the way I do

See me (Within the light)
Flowing (Take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (Pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

I feel a love light rush over me
I feel the love turn to me
And then your love just creeps over me
Over

And there inside our private war
I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I suppose to do

I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothing would change, nothing would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothing's any good

Needed a savior
Someone to pull me

So I'm counting on you now

Broke my heart

Broke my heart

Here I am
So don't leave me stranded

He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

Diamond life, lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask

Take your time if the going gets tough

You opened out your arms
To all those young men
And girl you had room
For every one of them
You're the only girl on bowery and third
Sure as hell you're the one who cared

So put your hands together for Sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for them
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world one angry day, in New- York

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen
Soot suit and shinny shoes
He ran around town and through his methylated laughter
Most of his memories drowned

Melt away when you never thought they'd heal

Were they as tender
As we dare to remember

What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
We're as tender as we dare to remember

Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss?
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

It's never... as good as the first time
Never... as good as the first time

Grandma came to see
Something she could not believe
How could her girl be so naive
Tar baby
Tar baby told the secret she conceived
Oh... that big old smile of yours
Could turn the wind into a song
How could I have doubted
Honey it's with me that you belong
Tar baby
Tar baby I love you so
I love you
Like a brand new blade... you cut into my life

Maureen
It's hard to explain
Never gonna see you again
You'll never meet my new friends
Maureen I miss you
I just can't explain
Never gonna see you again
I wish you could meet my new friends
Walking along the subway listening to
Loving you is easy acapella
You were a souped up car in that rent a go cart town
And I miss you

We're as thick as thieves

Remember when my mother said to me
Sade don't you come home too late
Till you're back I stay awake
And Maureen
With the boys you can tell at a glance

He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

Diamond life, lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator

Touching the very part of me

Tearing the very heart of me

Round and round and round my head

Too busy thinking

Hit me like a slow bullet

And there inside our private war
I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I suppose to do

I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothing would change, nothing would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothing's any good

I have so much to do
I have to carry on

So put your hands together for Sally

Put your hands together for Sally

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen

And there inside our private
war I died the night before
And all of these remnants
of joy and disaster
What am I supposed to do
I want to cook you a soup that
warms your soul
But nothing would change
nothing would change at all
Its just a day that brings
it all about
Just another day
And nothings any good

The DJ's playing the

I have so much to do
I have to carry on

He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

Diamond life, lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask

In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love

Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious

So if you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow

Gotta stick together
Hand in glove
Hold tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games

Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough
It's not easy don't give up

Help them to have some future
Help them to live long

I'm at the borderline of my faith
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
In the frontline of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

I'm a soldier of love.
Every day and night
I'm soldier of love
All the days of my life

No one much around but us
Then I see this young boy
Caught a look at me

I'm stunned in a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way

She liked his eyes, she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care

That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Even to the angels it may sound like a lie

Maureen
It's hard to explain
Never gonna see you again
You'll never meet my new friends
Maureen I miss you
I just can't explain
Never gonna see you again
I wish you could meet my new friends
Walking along the subway listening to
Loving you is easy acapella
You were a souped up car in that rent a go cart town
And I miss you
Maureen
We're as thick as thieves
Maureen Maureen
Remember when my mother said to me
Sade don't you come home too late
Till you're back I stay awake
And Maureen
With the boys you can tell at a glance

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
Gave you love

I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

Didn't I tell you
What I believe?
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last?

Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby?

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
Gave you love

I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

For more than two years now
Ooh, can't get a job

Ooh, they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life

Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

You rarely see a love that's true
Wasn't that enough for you

I would climb a mountain

Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun
Hit me like a slow bullet

No more war, no more war, no more war
Just a little peace
No more war, no more war
All we want is some peace in this world
