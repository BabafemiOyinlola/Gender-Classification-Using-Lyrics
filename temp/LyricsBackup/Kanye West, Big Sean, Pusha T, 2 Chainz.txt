It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is - when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!

Lamborghini Mercy
Your chic she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

Lamborghini Mercy
Your chic she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

Lamborghini Mercy
Your chic she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

Lamborghini Mercy
Your chic she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

Okay, drop it to the floor
Make that ass shake
Whoa make the ground move, that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this err' day-day?
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin', so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'
White girls politicin' that's that Sarah Palin
Gettin' high, Californicatin'
I give her that D, cause that's where I was born and raised in

Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chic she so thirsty (swerve)
I'm in that two seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl she tryna jerk me (swerve)

Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chic she so thirsty (swerve)
I'm in that two seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl she tryna jerk me (swerve)

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
