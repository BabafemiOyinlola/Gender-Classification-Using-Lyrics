Take my hand (Take my hand)

Walk with me, take my hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Still water, still water

Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag, if I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
...

So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young

So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young

Just because I am shy
Doesn't mean that I'm the guy for you
It's just my game
I would like to be
What you think you say you need someday
And lose my shame

I know you're wonderin' why
I don't treat you like the others do
I'm not the same
Ten, got ten on me
There's some things you're not supposed to see
What's your name

N'aria serena doppo na tempesta
Pe' ll'aria fresca pare gia na festa
Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole
Ma n'atu sole
Cchiu bello, oje ne'

Hey, lady
I’ve been wantin’ to talk to you for a long, long time
You know what
Somehow it just never seems to come together

Hey, lady, oh

Well, I wonder if you know
You’ve been on my mind
It’s true, girl
Been dreamin’ of the time
When I can be apart of your world
Your world

Can I spend some time with you
Baby, just us two
Darlin’, give me your hand
Say that I can be your man
And I will never let you down
You ask me if I love you
All I can do is say, oh

Lady, I love you, I love you
Never met a girl so right
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you

Will it stay, the love you feel for you me
Will it say
That you will be by my side to see me through
Until my life is through

Well, in my mind (My mind)
We can conquer the world (We can conquer the whole world) in love

You and I
You and I
