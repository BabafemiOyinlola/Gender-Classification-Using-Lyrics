Each time you break away, I fear you're gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

To show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by

Pretending never ends, dear

But I can't let you know

Got to have you back I need you
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride
Made me break your heart
Now our love has died
I see a closing door - a door never more
A door of jealousy between your love and me
Now I face a storm of tears
You took the sunshine from my face
Now I'm just another man
Who walks the undestined way
Without your guiding hand
I can hardly tell when I'm the man
Pride made a fool of me
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me

As the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you loved has departed
And you're left alone and brokenhearted
Girl, love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows

Girl, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, That's the way love is)

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
Oh, and your whole world's cavin' in
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I know you're leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while
We all must feel heartache sometime
Right now, right now, now, I'm feeling mine

I tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child wrapped in a cradle

It's 2 a.m., just gettin' in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors

So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa whoa whoa )
Mmm, something's goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah
Bom-bom-bom
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear
Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby
Give me what you got (then a man said)
Sexy lady (ooh), drive me crazy
Drive me wild (all I heard was my baby's voice screamin')
You're contagious, touch me, baby (touch me)
Give me what you got (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and I felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep, I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones, big crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy

Hey mister, walkin' with the blues
Hey sister, payin' heavy dues
Havin' troubles, and it ain't so hard to find
When you're ridin' double, and you're runnin' out of time
No need to feel that you lack the spirit
Within the body, but it's in the soul
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back
Need a little taste of love, need a little taste
Need a little taste of love, I'm gonna need a little taste
Hey mister

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and I felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep, I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones, big crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy

Ooh, hoo, hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Standing in the rain
Teardrops begin to fall
I could feel your pain
Raindrops just hide it all
He said I didn't need you, made you cry
You turned and walked away
I was there again with my arms open wide
Didn't you hear me say?
(Come to me)
I'll show you better ways
(Come to me)
I love you, girl
(Come to me)
Oh, babe
(Come to me)
Wanting you to hold
I chased your love through the storm
Out of self control

Pretty little baby
Won't you listen to my heart?
My needs are simple
And you're what I've been needing from the start
Like honey
To a honeybee
You got me buzzing
I see what I need
I ain't lying
Gonna lay it on the line
This is the moment tonight
I got to make you mine
Like candy
To a wild-eyed child
I see what I want
And it's driving me wild
Release your love
Girl, you got to give it up to me, oh, baby
Very good, so good
Release your love to me
Only you can set me free
Wanna get closer

Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Won't you, won't you please tell her that I love
I still love her? Oh, yes I do

Look in here, I woke up this morning
And I realized what I had done

So sad, she was weeping,
As she said my life is ruined;

And I said, there is someone who really care,
There is someone who really cares,
There is someone who hears you cries,
There is someonew who wanna heal you,
Open your heart let Him in.

Is love behind me?
Though I need you to satisfy me
Destiny will prove to divide me
For you're a part of me
I feel the love within you
Your beauty lies deep within you
Touching me when you feel the need to
Become as one with me

So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

Take you for granted?
That could never, never be
An advantage
All this love, and free from demanding
You have always felt the need to be pleased
And you stay close beside me
Though our minds are free for deciding
The life to lead and desiring

But these aren't dues I been paying

There's no sign of love right now you know
So you walk your way
Let me walk mine
You walk your way
Let me walk mine

Cuz I'm used to planning my days

As she said my life is ruined;
Oh! She cried my baby's gone,
I've got no hope to live this life along;
And she said my whole world is burning,

And I said, there is someone who really care,
There is someone who really cares,
There is someone who hears you cries,
There is someonew who wanna heal you,
Open your heart let Him in.

I tell you I love you now and forever
Your doing me wrong but there's nothing I can do
We've been through days when nothing would go right

We would make love
Through rainy weather
Go to the movies and laugh together
Please won't you see girl what your doing to me

And I felt so disturbed

Every time you call my name

I've got a lust ignited fever
And I can't put out the flame

Next time that I saw you
I felt so at ease
You had a languid disposition
I had an willingness to please

And your candy apple red lips
Full of violets and sex
Had me harder than a coal train
Had my collar wringing wet

Now I'm gonna crash and burn
But I'm not finished yet

I want you to come home, cause I feel so all alone
And I feel so sad
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Got to have you back I need you
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride
Made me break your heart
Now our love has died
I see a closing door - a door never more
A door of jealousy between your love and me
Now I face a storm of tears
You took the sunshine from my face
Now I'm just another man
Who walks the undestined way
Without your guiding hand
I can hardly tell when I'm the man
Pride made a fool of me
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
As the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you loved has departed
And you're left alone and brokenhearted
Girl, love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows

Girl, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, That's the way love is)

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
Oh, and your whole world's cavin' in
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I know you're leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while
We all must feel heartache sometime
Right now, right now, now, I'm feeling mine

I tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child wrapped in a cradle

Hold it, baby, I turned you on
Now I can't turn you off
I turned you on
Now I can't turn you off

What a good, good feeling
A great sensation
You and me, baby
A good combination

Sock it to me
Sock it to me
Sock it to me
Sock it to me

Baby, I started it
But I can't stop it
I admit that I started it, baby
Girl but I can't stop it

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and I felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep, I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones, big crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy

Time after time when we're together
I tell you I love you now and forever
Your doing me wrong but there's nothing I can do
We've been through days when nothing would go right
In your arms your holding me so tight
Please won't you let me come into your heart
We would make love
Through rainy weather
Go to the movies and laugh together
Please won't you see girl what your doing to me

Chorus:
Girl, why don't you just understand

So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused

Mmm, something's goin' on upstairs, yeah

There is someone who hears you cries,
There is someonew who wanna heal you,
Open your heart let Him in.

>anybody has the lyrics for the beatles sonf "twist & shout".
This Isley Brothers song was excellently covered by the Beatles. They
Did several of their own versions, in terms of order and etc.,
Especially shortening it as time went on and they began using it to open
Every show (and tune up :-), before dropping it altogether when playing
Live.
Here (from memory - I *think* correct...) is the studio version - apologies
For any errors.
(Ascending "ah!"s, adding harmonies...)
Well, shake it up baby, now!
(Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout!

Well, come on baby now

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and I felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep, I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones, big crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy

Up in the mornin' out on the job, work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids

While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lawd above, can't you know I'm pinin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise

As she said my life is ruined;

It's your thing, do what you want to do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.

If you want me to love you, maybe I will.
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal.
You need love now, just as bad as I do.
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to.

I'm not trying to run your life, I know you want to do what's right.
Give your love now, to whoever you choose.

Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

You've given me a true love and ev'ry day I thank you love,
For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony,
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.

Got to have you back I need you
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride
Made me break your heart
Now our love has died
I see a closing door - a door never more
A door of jealousy between your love and me
Now I face a storm of tears
You took the sunshine from my face
Now I'm just another man
Who walks the undestined way
Without your guiding hand
I can hardly tell when I'm the man
Pride made a fool of me
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me

As the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why

Girl, love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows

Girl, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, That's the way love is)

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
Oh, and your whole world's cavin' in

Calling your name, Peaches
In my lonely, lonely room, there's nothing left but the past

And why it didn't last, I think of how sweet all the love was
All the good times we had
I want you to come home, cause I feel so all alone
And I feel so sad

It's 2 a.m., just gettin' in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa whoa whoa )
Mmm, something's goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah
Bom-bom-bom
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear
Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby
Give me what you got (then a man said)
Sexy lady (ooh), drive me crazy
Drive me wild (all I heard was my baby's voice screamin')
You're contagious, touch me, baby (touch me)
Give me what you got (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady

To the motherland

One by one we're gonna stand with the pride
One that can't be denied
(Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up)
From the highest mountain, and valley low
We'll join together, with hearts of gold

Now the children of the world can see
There's a better way for us to be
The place where mankind was born
Is so neglected and torn... torn apart

Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love (Stand up, stand up, stand up)
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love

>anybody has the lyrics for the beatles sonf "twist & shout".
This Isley Brothers song was excellently covered by the Beatles. They
Did several of their own versions, in terms of order and etc.,
Especially shortening it as time went on and they began using it to open
Every show (and tune up :-), before dropping it altogether when playing
Live.
Here (from memory - I *think* correct...) is the studio version - apologies
For any errors.
(Ascending "ah!"s, adding harmonies...)
Well, shake it up baby, now!

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and I felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep, I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones, big crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy

Full of violets and sex
Had me harder than a coal train
Had my collar wringing wet

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and I felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep, I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones, big crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy

It's 2 a.m., just gettin' in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors

I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa whoa whoa )
Mmm, something's goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah
Bom-bom-bom
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear
Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby
Give me what you got (then a man said)
Sexy lady (ooh), drive me crazy
Drive me wild (all I heard was my baby's voice screamin')
You're contagious, touch me, baby (touch me)
Give me what you got (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass

As I fell asleep, I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones, big crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear

She's never ever been kissed.
Rubbidy rub dub dub,
She's never ever been in love.
She's never been in the moonlight
Watchin' the stars above.
What kind of girl is this?
She's never been out on a date.

There was a story
About a man comin' in
Findin' his woman in bed with
Well, listen
It's 2 a.m., just gettin' in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa whoa whoa )
Mmm, something's goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah
Bom-bom-bom
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear
Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby
Give me what you got (then a man said)
Sexy lady (ooh), drive me crazy
Drive me wild (all I heard was my baby's voice screamin')
You're contagious, touch me, baby (touch me)
Give me what you got (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sexy lady, drive me crazy (then I heard another man, yeah)
Drive me wild (And I just can't believe this shit)
I ran downstairs, looked in the closet, lookin' for that, ooh

We would make love
Through rainy weather
Go to the movies and laugh together
Please won't you see girl what your doing to me

>anybody has the lyrics for the beatles sonf "twist & shout".
This Isley Brothers song was excellently covered by the Beatles. They
Did several of their own versions, in terms of order and etc.,
Especially shortening it as time went on and they began using it to open
Every show (and tune up :-), before dropping it altogether when playing
Live.
Here (from memory - I *think* correct...) is the studio version - apologies
For any errors.
(Ascending "ah!"s, adding harmonies...)
Well, shake it up baby, now!
(Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout!

Well, come on baby now

Ooh, this old heart of mine, been broken thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you're gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake
To show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You've got me never knowing if I'm coming or going but I

I love you

A dream no longer reality
I live the shadows of our past
With this love that's born to last

I guess I'll always love you

Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while

So I called her mother's house and asked has she seen my baby.
Roll my six around looking for that missing lady.
Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news
then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused.
And then I turned the TV down

cause I thought I heard a squicky sound,
somethings going on upstairs
and I know nobody else lives here
"bump bump bump" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear

then I hear my babies voice in my ear screaming out...
You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got

We been kickin' it for quite some time
Lots of private parties where we're winding down
Tonight I'm in a different mood
Just want to get close to you
No RSVP necessary
Tonight it's me and you, girl

Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
I just came here to chill
There'll be no other VIP
The party's only you and me
I just came here to chill

You're a special lady
The world can see
Nobody makes a room shine
Like you and me

You always know just what to wear
Nails just right, lovely hair

>anybody has the lyrics for the beatles sonf "twist & shout".
This Isley Brothers song was excellently covered by the Beatles. They
Did several of their own versions, in terms of order and etc.,
Especially shortening it as time went on and they began using it to open
Every show (and tune up :-), before dropping it altogether when playing
Live.
Here (from memory - I *think* correct...) is the studio version - apologies
For any errors.
(Ascending "ah!"s, adding harmonies...)

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel

So sad, she was weeping,
As she said my life is ruined;
Oh! She cried my baby's gone,
I've got no hope to live this life along;
And she said my whole world is burning,
I'd rather die than living in agony.
And I said, there is someone who really care,
There is someone who really cares,
There is someone who hears you cries,
There is someonew who wanna heal you,
Open your heart let Him in.

As the sun gives no light as before

What kind of girl is this?
She's never ever been kissed.
Rubbidy rub dub dub,
She's never ever been in love.
She's never been in the moonlight
Watchin' the stars above.
What kind of girl is this?
She's never been out on a date.

There was a story
About a man comin' in
Findin' his woman in bed with
Well, listen
It's 2 a.m., just gettin' in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa whoa whoa )
Mmm, something's goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah
Bom-bom-bom
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear
Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby
Give me what you got (then a man said)
Sexy lady (ooh), drive me crazy
Drive me wild (all I heard was my baby's voice screamin')
You're contagious, touch me, baby (touch me)
Give me what you got (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sexy lady, drive me crazy (then I heard another man, yeah)
Drive me wild (And I just can't believe this shit)
I ran downstairs, looked in the closet, lookin' for that, ooh

Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
