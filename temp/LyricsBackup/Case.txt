Now makin' Jamaica breakn' all you paper

You're the only one for me
You're the only one I need
Can't no body make me feel
The way you makin' me feel
And girl you know this love is real

Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby, I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love, I can't control

I'll spend the night with you

There's more to love than making love baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming and baby I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to give to you

Last night I called you on the phone
And you weren't there when I called
So now I'm wondering if you've gone away

Gave you everything a man could give
And now you're gone
And I'll keep on holding on 'cause there's more

There's more to love than making love baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming and baby I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to give to you

Guess what i did today.
Those were the words I said to you.
It was last may, dont know the exact day .
In my hand, there was a ring.
Then you told me that you love me

So I asked you would you do me
the honor of being my wife. (yes i will)
I will be your man.
Your protector.
Your best friend.

Every day I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that
You're everything I need and more

If only I could find you

Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man

I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you

Driving 'round, thought I saw you pass me
My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me
'Cause you fade away

Maybe I'm just hallucinating
'Cause my loneliness got the best of me

I could belong to the wrong someone else
'Cause I know in her heart she was afraid

Just explodes, but that's just wishful thinking?

Loving you was incredible
It came so natural to me
'Cause you were always available
For every one of my wants and needs
We always talked about settling down
Raising a family
But sometimes in life our plans ain't meant to be, ooh yeah

Baby I've tried
But couldn't say
What I really did want from you
Baby and now
My life, my life hasn't been the same
No, no, no babe
Can we give it a chance
Can we start all over again
Before we throw it all away, I just need to know

Here I go around again
Just won't let it die
Being wrong or being right
I just have to try
Love leads me right back to you
It never tells me why
I ain't gonna go through life
...

I remember summer girl, we fell apart
We were so close girl, never felt another in my life
but youve moved on hope you're doing fine
they say you're in love but i know you still think of me

Even though he may kiss your body real nice
I know you think of me girl, everytime
Even though he makes love to you everynight
I know you think of me girl, everytime

Now I hear he treats you real good, makes you so happy
That cannot compare to all the time and love we invested
It's okay, I've moved on, So, take care of yourself

Standing here looking out my window
My nights are long and my days are cold
'Cause I don't have you
How can I be so damn demanding?
I know you said that it's over now
But I can't let go

Every day I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you

Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm the ring without a hand
I'm missing you

...

Driving 'round, thought I saw you pass me
My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me
'Cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
'Cause my loneliness got the best of me
And my heart's so weak

Your girlfriend wants to get with me
I can tell how she looks at me
And how she licks her tongue at me
Then ask for a ride home from me
She likes what I do to you
Tell you all the things that you never knew
Like the sky and her Ferrari's blue
Spending time in Honolulu

I told you once before
About that girl
She's so mysterious
So watch that girl
And keep that girl
Away from me
'Cause she's jocking me
(She's jockin' me)

Your girl (wanting me)
I see her (watching me)
She's licking (her lips at me)
She's not your friend
The girl (so shady)
I see her (watching me)
She's licking (her lips at me)
She's not your friend
That girl

Your friend wants to get wit' me
She's hawking me down like you wouldn't believe
Leaving her panties
At my doorstep too
Writing me letters, dissin' you
She's a freak like I told you so
Said she wanna go toe to toe
With me and your other girl Coko
Just sit back babe, watch her go

I told you once before

You can have what you want, it's all right

But for some reason I can't keep my cool
Since the day I met ya, must be something special
Got me shook up with the things you do

Know it's time for me to backspace the thoughts of you
But my functions ain't the same so it ain't no use
And I know that we've grown so far apart
All the space ain't a place for a broken heart
Press ctrl, alt, delete but
I'm afraid it might erase the memories of us
But I'm sure that a restart
Grant me the access to your heart
So if your password hasn't changed
And it's still your first name
Do you mind if I check if our connections still remains?

And I know you've been programmed to stop me
You could override the command, [?] stare and block me

Do you ever think about us?
Do you ever think if were ever to get back together?

I will no longer hide what I've been up to
As long as you don't cry when yoo hear the truth
Here it goes

You wanted to go, I wanted to stay
Thought we had a night, just you and me
But I was here alone, how much can i take
Before I start to break

Cause I wanted you, I wanted you
But you made me go, turn 1 to 2
2 turned to 3, 3 turned to 4
4 turned to "I don't even love you like before"
Cause I wanted you, I wanted you
Now there so many, don't know what to do
That's how I learned to juggle, to juggle
I never want to hurt you baby I love you

There's more to love than making love baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming and baby I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to give to you

Last night I called you on the phone
And you weren't there when I called
So now I'm wondering if you've gone away

Gave you everything a man could give
And now you're gone
And I'll keep on holding on 'cause there's more

There's more to love than making love baby

There's more to dreams than dreaming and baby I'm not dreaming

I just feel sad when I think of love
And this is the saddest day I'm going through, hmmm
Even though I know, that it's all because of me
I can't believe that you would go away and leave me so lonely
I'm trying to hold my head and live beside of all this pain
I need to feel your touch, your tender kiss
So that I can breathe again
You gotta forgive me if you feel I'm going wrong
But it feels like I'm just going down
And I'm feeling this way too long

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Out of my mind over you
(It's all because of you I don't know what I'm gonna do)
I know that I don't need another lady
Cause deep inside my heart I love you

Tonight I know for sure what I lost in you

Without you girl
Things didn't turn out right
Time to move on

Every night the tears fall from my eyes
To wash away the loneliness
Long after your tears have dried
I'll be cryin' over time, over time

Life just seems so cold
With a lonely heart
But it's so hard to let go
Of this love that I feel for you

For every night the tears fall from my eyes
To wash away the loneliness

Guess what i did today.
Those were the words I said to you.
It was last may, dont know the exact day .
In my hand, there was a ring.
Then you told me that you love me
more than anything in your life.
So I asked you would you do me
the honor of being my wife. (yes i will)
I will be your man.
Your protector.
Your best friend.
'Til my humble life is ended
Then time begins again (couldn't we)

And I just can't clear my head of you

Baby I don't know what it is thats tellin' me
That nothing could be more than lovin' you
I try to get my thoughts and my feelings together
But no matter how I try to find it, brings me back to you

In the morning
(I think of you)
Day and night

Everyday

And every other day
(Oh, I can too)

That's right
Life is funny, ain't it?
Sometimes you can end up with
Somebody you really don't wanna be with
And others left to figure it out
Check it

She was more than a woman, a goddess for all it seems
And all I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were cool and the grooving of love was on
But I still remember how it felt when our love was gone

In a tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
Secret memories in her mind
How could love be so unkind?
Heartbreak time
My heart is breaking, oh

Just in a broken glass

Damn, i got honey right here
I like to make her go
Recipient of multiple heartbeats

Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you like and
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it you, baby
Tell me all your secrets
Baby, i'll tell you mine
Love to make your dreams come true

I've been lonely for a long, long time
Don't quite know what love is, so i spread it around (get your hopes around)
She was from a distance, didn't know what to say
But i knew you were the one for me (i like that)

If you want me, just whisper you could let me know
Letting all my feelings go
Don't wanna be in love alone

And if I come back you know
How wrong it feels to be alone

It's sad that my love has gone away
And it's too bad the love I gave was too real to stay
Now loving you has become separate ways
So now I think, I gotta leave 'cuz I really need my space
You

If you want me, just whisper you could let me know
Letting all my feelings go
Don't wanna be in love alone
If you need me, what you need to do is let me go
And if I come back you know
How wrong it feels to be alone

Understand that I don't really want to go away, no no
But you not trusting me, pushing me away

And tell me, dancing lady, said to step to you

Oh, so damn sexy but you're scandalous
