I've waited oh so long
for you to come to me
What did I do wrong
It's all a mystery to me

Baby I feel it too
What am I supposed to do
Maybe I've just changed
Or could I be wrong for you

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I'm not your plaything
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
Am I your plaything

You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
With my heart, my love
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
With my heart, my love

Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Let it get into you
C'mon, I've got a groove
You know where I'll be, funkin for jamaica
If ya feel it, let it get into you
Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Baby, let it get into you

Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
Hey man, guitar Brown

He always says, "Wanna play, you wanna play, you wanna play?"
Hey, what's up? (Play, we could do it)

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit
Everytime I roll up, niggas holla roll up and I tell 'em hold up
You ain't gettin' money, you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos, smoking on indo
High as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Everytime I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holler get 'em girls
Daddy need new shoes, daddy need Perelli's
They look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit

Operator, number, please:
It's been so many years
Will she remember my old voice
While I fight the tears?
Hello, hello there, is this Martha?
This is old Tom Frost,
And I am calling long distance,
Don't worry 'bout the cost.
'Cause it's been forty years or more,
Now Martha please recall,
Meet me out for coffee,
Where we'll talk about it all.

And those were the days of roses,
Poetry and prose and Martha
All I had was you and all you had was me.
There was no tomorrows,
We'd packed away our sorrows

I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine

Came home last night
There was fire and smoke on the TV
The cops and the army
People running out in the streets looting
I took off my clothes
And came four times
Could not leave myself alone
It was porno for pyros
Porno for pyros
Porno for pyros
Porno for pyros
Porno for pyros
Porno for pyros
I got in my car
