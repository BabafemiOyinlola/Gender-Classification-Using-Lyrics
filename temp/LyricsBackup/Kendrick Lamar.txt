Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to a God)
I want everything black (That we don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

1]

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I rarely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad

Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down to the top

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more

Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?

But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?

One two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two
One two
Turn the headphones up Ali
One two
You mix with Dre, right?
Turn the headphones up
When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere."
The presents of being rare
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example, for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
That's the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse

Said I'm a fuckin monster
A massive attack will haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors mastered that
After that I went for thermometers
Popped them all then popped them in the jar
Tracy veronica holla back
They promise theres no pajamas
Insomnia when attack I attack like pirahana
Theres hit your block like a comet
And you all know what time it is 2012 mark your calendars
Calisthenics and silence is excersize
And that trigger strapped
Rock with us Metallica competition
No talent I'm in the jungle
Loud enough just might stumble
Upon a pack of lions no lying
My soldiers dying
This is like rap alliance is lining with
Stars and bars of a prison wrapped my science applying
Pressure a stretcher is needed paint prosthese of your living dead
Your stuff is a giga pet
You niggas cant see me unless you watchin that TV
Ill hold your hug in my silouette
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit till I feel my breath start stinkin my fuckin chest
She fuckin the fuckin best mean my dick is the dick of death
Mean I'm killin that pussy like spike whenever that jerry slip

Yeah dre
Me and Andre the giant 6'7" and climbin
Whether your storm to your climbin
Whether your beat makin a rhyme and
Bumpin some feelins huh man with a handful of diamonds like jay fans on an island with ray bans
Glasses, palmin' asses that probably came with a great tan
I'll be the motherfuckin mecca of this hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fuckin frogs rectum
While you're wrecking with irreputable my words so incredible
Probably call the federal after I slaughter several

It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards darling.
And we'll be screaming out "No Rules, No
Rules"
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed
you
My vision of the unsocial, is so cool
Look around me and just see the same, who to
blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the
game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is
nothing that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim my religion is to

Out your power position my army head on

Cant harm me out of my own skin, government

Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw a
Young nigga hopping out busting like four charters
Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
Phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal
Open the doorway to his soul
Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
Aim it at your arteries pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
My innocence would eventually see a hindrance
Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
Something my papa said that caught my attention
His eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
He said I'm seven going on sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime

The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I'm just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people's champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won't mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts of it, it's real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y'all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I'm rollin' deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays
It's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I'm the one

Then speed off in a Bronco, OJ
Often reminisce about the old days, Hardaway/Alonzo
Back then we was wearing LA gears with the rhinestones
Nowadays I'm coming headfirst like a rhino

Now nigga spin my vinyl, club going apeshit

Boy I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women, yeah that's bunk bed bitches
I've done lived more than an eighty year old man still kickin'
Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls that barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall bitch like a drought but
You gon' get this rain like it's May weather, G.O.O.D. Music, Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better, they told me I never boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid to reverse debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
So I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind
In my mind, but fuck tryin' and not doin'
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G. and Pac bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that Juicy vid
I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like AK was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah I know that shit ain't fair
They say that Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone

Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo' bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch


Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now


Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it’s necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit, I’m with the homies

Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas

Turn the headphones up Ali

You mix with Dre, right?
Turn the headphones up Ali
When the world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say,
"Kendrick, just persevere."
The presence of being real
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example, for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
That's the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K

Without further adieu

I remember growing up
Just a Dogg Pound pup bumping G Thang
It's that gin and juice in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and raised
Kurupt and RBX, the original gang
Bad ass super fly, I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., that's the way I was raised

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings
and if I speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney & Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who

and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch, I'ma cut you off

Cause every time you come around you be hollering that

Shut the fuck up... hoe

Every time you come around you be hollering that

Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
Phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal
Open the doorway to his soul
Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
Aim it at your arteries pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
My innocence would eventually see a hindrance
Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
Something my papa said that caught my attention
His eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
He said I'm seven going on sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime

How you shoot a nigga out, then shoot a nigga out?
Dead bodies in my dreams, Bob Marley on my couch

You really think Elvis Presley committed suicide?

Are we gonna live or die?

So I was takin' a walk the other day,
And I seen a woman, a blind woman
pacin' up and down the sidewalk.

Close your eyes
Uhh
Close your eyes
So watch 'em do the macarena somewhere out in Pasadena
Love the drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Living, this time around I'm not kidding
I had an intuition about these women in suspicion
Got me looking at you different how a man in my position
Can't start slipping down these slopes
Cuz it's all just
As a kid I didn't learn that but
When you were young and you were just tryna live your
Life and have some fun
In the world when you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you're deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
Sometimes I be feeling like a needle to these young kids
You had the world you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is

Let it become intact
Don't ever let it go

Selling all these O's, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, about to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood and I put that on my life

And I ain't never been a Tom or a Jerry, pussy or a rat
Pussy on my nut sack, carry plenty Kenny Tates

To all my niggas I would die for
Load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time steppin' in the pen

Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)

Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I'm a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote

Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey "press play" while I press up on a girl
In a mist that I smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That's real big, pop my color, pop that lid

Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy

You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put 2 chains on and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild
Too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made Oh Boy
Oh boy, I'm the man now

This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say when I wanna say it, okay then
Further more we do this for y'all

Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning

And if they take everything, know I got

Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

Didn't know why till I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'ma fuck that girl
Good kid, m.A.A.d. city, watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences, fucking right
It's either that or life sentences, I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoked, like where the weed at
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that

Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap, and then we slide through your hood three-dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Uhh, bomb ass head, uhh, till she can't blink
And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

That bitch was racist, got me fired
Ever since then I had no job

Stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit
Judge give me life, nigga

KENDRICK LAMAR - "SHE NEEDS ME" LYRICS

One time, reportin' live, Compton California

She go to work, she go to school,
Her body's smooth, no tattoos,
Type a girl that'll make your mother feel comfortable,
My pops love her too, she's compatible,
She's independent, she handle her business,
She believe in God and no other religions…
She's never in competition
When it comes to her friends
She's dependable; she set her own trends
A confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor,
Look at her hips, I want to be a pager…
Conservative, affirmative
Actually she reluctant to sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see,
A true queen and she needs me.
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God a blind man can see,
A true queen and she needs me.

It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him

Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years

I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old

And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks

And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life

I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
Understood
Where is your faith?
Faith, all you need is the size of a mustard seed

Single black parent from Compton raising children of 4
That's 4 innocent bastards cause Papa, they don't know

to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down

Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show that you're real
Middle fingers up
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit
Call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio then out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face
play me short like an oompa loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
grew up with killas man, people who killed, man
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man

1: Kendrick Lamar]
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

What I gotta do in order to see success?

Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Gather your wit, take a deep look inside

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie, I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?

Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
And she plays only when you tell her no

No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth

Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension

Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
"20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him "I ain't have it" and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the
first? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting
your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I rarely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad

Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down to the top

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more

Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?

But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?

You mix with Dre, right?
Turn the headphones up

When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere."
The presence of being real
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example, for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
Thats the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse

Pillars of joy can be found
Through the thought of you
I'll be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love

Canei Finch on the beat
Turn the headphones up, Ali
Here we go

I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why till I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'ma fuck that girl
Good kid, m.A.A.d. city, watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences, fucking right
It's either that or life sentences, I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoked, like where the weed at
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price, back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap, and then we slide through your hood three-dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Uhh, bomb ass head, uhh, till she can't blink
And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

I'm so damn turnt, wheeling in a two-door
with two hoes that follow me, and you know
Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though

Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I'm so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don't care where ya are
Just blink twice and I'm there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga

You ain't been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six

Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of Hip-Hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dumpin' out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smell like Dior and derrière
Decoys die slow, you can detour to heaven's stairs
Or walk inside hell's dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream

I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac brown, looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, one love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3: 30
Telling me it's all good, Tiger Woods, now we looking for the +birdy+ birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers

Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice

My back against the wall, I can see y'all fronting
Drowning in your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing
I call this shit "Rapper Shit" cause I ain't a rapper
But if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after
Caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor
You're lame, paving away, Bob the Buil' factor
I'm a real master, real massive, you just real average
I see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage
And it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
Don't act like you knew my tactics
Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last
I see through your true colors like stained glass
I see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
And what's the odds of even thinking you coincide
When every time a nigga open a door you go inside
Just to realize, either you're weak or someone lied
See, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
So by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo
And who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
Would slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab
Ab-Soul, Abstract Asshole
Black Lip Bastard, et cetera for forever
I follow no ruler, even if I'm under a drastic measure
But whatever

They say pressure bust pipes
And I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar

Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light

You do it right or don't do it at all
Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like buying 'em and being saw, awYou know that killer californication
When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing

Pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed
Can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder
No challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein

The good kid

I'm tired of doing it
the same way, gotta flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
Opinions get thrown out the window with Ron Browz
So turn me up loud so the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
and go death, go death I said
Go death and stay dead, a shot to the forehead to kill 'em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I'm militant as Martin Luther King and a penalty
Aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
I've got in it my genes, you probably think I'm talking bout a pistol
but I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga, what you worry for? I ain't tryna jock your swag
I'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant, yeah

As time flies, hope that I'm soaring

Said I'm a fuckin' monster
A massive attack I haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometors
Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia will attack I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet (BLAHH!) and you all know what time it is

Rock with us Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq

My science applyin' pressure her stretcher is needed pay the proceeds
Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet

Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest

Mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

Whether your beat makin' or rhyming

Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans

One time, reportin' live, Compton California

She go to work, she go to school,
Her body's smooth, no tattoos,
Type a girl that'll make your mother feel comfortable,
My pops love her too, she's compatible,
She's independent, she handle her business,
She believe in God and no other religions…
She's never in competition
When it comes to her friends
She's dependable; she set her own trends
A confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor,
Look at her hips, I want to be a pager…
Conservative, affirmative
Actually she reluctant to sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see,
A true queen and she needs me.
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God a blind man can see,
A true queen and she needs me.

Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise

how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental

This is physical and mental, I won't sugar-coat it

You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it

And everything on TV just a figment of imagination

I don't want no plastic nation, +dread+ that like a Haitian

While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship

Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR

It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD

A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
"Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine

Life's about decisions man

Just take control if you can

I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again

What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...

Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know

But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck
Still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in it's finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up

Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house

A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack

Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, know how to maul with my wrist
Shout to writers for holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down

Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show that you're real
Middle fingers up
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit
Call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio then out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face
play me short like an oompa loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
grew up with killas man, people who killed, man
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man

Greeting boys and girls
My name is Petey P
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (that's right)
I am your neighbor
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city
So grab your cartoons and cereal
Your pop guns and fireworks
And sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
(Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...)
I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burgerstand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion

I used to a lot of humbling when i was little
Got a lot of whoopings over that shit too
And thats random, But so what?
Ha ha ha
Gimme that beat, fool
This a full time jack
no really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad
pussy you fucked with the wrong one
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe ammonia
Good kid, mad city
evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fuckin' with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
It's a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch The Sky"
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Ya'll married to the game well I'm bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite

Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
(And when I do I do it again
Then I go back
When I do I do it again
Then I go back
Thug it out)

Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again

What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know

Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise

how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental

This is physical and mental, I won't sugar-coat it

You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it

And everything on TV just a figment of imagination

I don't want no plastic nation, +dread+ that like a Haitian

While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship

Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR

I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid

You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Alright, here we go, third take, real quick Ali

Got me breathing with dragons

I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic

And this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate this fucking parasite

(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody couldn't think of a better D

She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that'll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she's compatible, she's independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me

And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack

I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?

Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have

I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge

Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch


Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now


Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it’s necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit, I’m with the homies

Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas

Just a kid, but what I did would probably leave Jesus shaking
For real – it get real in the field, they kill for pills
And sling packs to dingbats, hoping they’ll cop ‘em some wheels
Niggas start hating, that pistol start clapping

Gee like if Biggie happened to splice with Pac and get it cracking

Thought it was cool to look the judge

Since my uncles was institutionalized

My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, every second gangstas try
To save me. How I'm gonna listen?

In your seat. You like to mistake a street
Nigga for a real nigga. The same
Nigga that killed with ya, squealed with ya
I deal with ya like my son
Stare at the sun and you'll be lookin
In my eyes homie. Stand for something
Fall for anything, and you working
With two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined
To blow, you hear the music

On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell

With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete

But what you can consider, that if it goes down

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now, cool
"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
Strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge

'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate

Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit, I’m with the homies

With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve

Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect

In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get 'em"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80, the message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was, I was hearing about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit, well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that forty dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'mma get it or die trying
I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em
With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga

It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that

Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you

Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind

Good times and to get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for (Women, weed and weather)
They come for (Women, weed and weather)

From all around the world for the (Women, weed and weather)
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA

My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him
Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no. nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control

I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made a dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals

We on?
Aight
1, 2, 3, go!

Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air

It feel like I'm supposed to here

Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through

That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time

And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another plan, it a short term goal for me

Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight

Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher

When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion

You live life on an everyday basis

I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them

Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and

Talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table, Tony had told him that he...
Young nigga hopping out, busting like 4 charters
Popping pills, mixing Galen then shermin some holy water
Mixing Galen then shermin some holy water
Sell it to a priest, he probably can get it off tomorrow
It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Fiends tryina kick the addiction to sucking class dicks
Vivid image is gonna get any fantasy you can fathom
Phantoms ain't the only thing that's suicidal
Open the doorway to a soul, hit the hallways
Then hit the closet, you see a rifle aiming at your arteries
Part of me, parts of me a psycho
And retrospect, my respect was a power ranger I know
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
My innocence really eventually see a endurance surrendering
... save the genesis heard it all from my bunk bed, yeah hustling
Something my papa said that caught my attention
His eyes red, he smoking on marijuana,
Mixing the 2 11, he said, I'm 7, going on 67

Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the... expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...

What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway

When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
(shit)
Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute

Migrated from the North Pole when I was fo'
Infatuated with cartoons and G.I. Joes
'Till something more greater took a toll: life
Not really, more like white Air Nikes
Evidently, I had a fondness for material things
Ten years old trynna get a 10-K ring
I forgot it was for me when the phone ringed
Elementary girls callin' the house
Desiree and Cheryl mama end hustled what we talkin' about
I'm talkin' about the good old days when we walked without knowing that could be our last time walking out
Now we can't walk witout protection
Bein' on the defensive, life ills
This life will put you in a crazy world
Just by knowing crime will never cure
So I'm strapped like Girbaud jeans
I'd rather see the pen like I was bowling
Rather than death, walkin' on heavy steps
It's a great place, but I ain't ready for Heaven yet
So I told God put me at the back of the line
Matter fact yesterday, swear to God I ain't lyin'
Movin' at a turtle pace, cause the fast lane got a day one uncle with one in the brain

Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail
No fam, no mail

Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead
Ship my music off with them instead

Live righteous nigga like my brother said

Said they'd go with eachother

Clenching his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb
And asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had a plan on him
He wanted war

Binged the block

Drowning in your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing

But if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after
Caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor
You're lame, paving away, Bob the Buil' factor

I see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage
And it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
Don't act like you knew my tactics
Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last
I see through your true colors like stained glass
I see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
And what's the odds of even thinking you coincide
When every time a nigga open a door you go inside
Just to realize, either you're weak or someone lied
See, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
So by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo
And who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
Would slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab

Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gon make me flip and split yo shit judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin, margin
Maintaining my modest modus as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry
"Hey what's up daddy?"

I'm going through something with life

She look better than Beyonce,

Where she's from? No I.D

That girl's an alien
And if I die

Before I wake
I pray that I'm
In outer space
UFO fly away way way way way
So let's go

Go go go

Go go go

Go go go

Uh, she got me goin'

I'm all in
Fifty stories

Where, you been?

Is it planet mars?
Far beyond the stars?
Are you a martian?
You're unfamiliar

But still I feel ya
Energy sendin' toward the ceilin'
I'm high now
Are you up there?
If you was
I would climb
Every other stair
I gotta stare

I mean wow
And I'm wowed

No one compares
I want a one

You must have won

Hurt people that love us
Love people

I’m inspired
So get inspired

And so he said
Why you gotta be so kind hearted
Why you couldn’t be a con artist
Why you couldn’t, why you couldn’t be mischievous or just a lil devious the moment that we first started
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil time
Why you let me use yours cus I don’t got mine
Why you always lift me up, when I’m completely giving up
Or when niggas holla whuss up, you give a dry response
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain’t got it
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping
Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hoppin'
Why you treatin my momma like she your momma too
Why you making promises that you’ll forever do
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you

Sometimes
We hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us

This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6

Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping? If what I write down
Don't collect this very moment then I'm on it, no question
In the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
This is me frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work, across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners with me?
"I thought you had a show?" Well ma nigga I guess I didn't

One time
Reporting live
Compton, California

Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep
Back down, backing ultra dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh what a cold world for a broke nigga--it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playin'
I was so sincere like Nas first name
In Belly, they tell me
It’s very difficult to see 25 and if I survive it’ll probably be with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats in the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys sellin' weed
Fuckin' up my prestige, till I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop

That's why I'm in the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
Ima tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass

The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and..., real talk, and
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)

Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine

Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

I'm tryna learn somethin new.
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searchin deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings...
And if I speak the good into existance, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock.
And by the way I'm a start
Findin more light to shed
Like a small garage in yo backyard.
I'm back chillin with a friend of mine.
She mighty fine but I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness.
Always hollerin who she don't like, and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearin a weave, who Dooney&Bourke bag is fake, who holdin the keys to the car she drove last year
Or who fuckin on who, and who need a pap smear.
Gettin on my nerves, but before yo negative energy curve, bitch I'm a cut you off.

Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the... expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...

What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway

When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
(shit)
Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right

Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more

Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking, she start running
like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

Fancy girls, on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Alright, here we go, third take. Real quick, Ali

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Bitch

And this is rigamortus and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up, if you could fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony

It go...

Ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just

Ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Hook - Pimp C]
Smoking out, throwin up
Keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads, at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
I can't f-ck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas)
I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business)
I can't f-ck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits)
I can't f-ck with y'all

[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 1]
Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas wanna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I'm hear and every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity

What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
There's fire in the street, fire in the swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
but I've cops circle the block, I puff squares
But I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary

Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan

We raising hell

Lord forbid
The homie got wet, so we tryna soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it
I hope you participating
Aiyyo Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here like back in '04
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
and the system made to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist 'em
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha were celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
who didn't play games like chil-dren?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off twenty-twelve

Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiPower

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone

Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slipped you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown man should never bite they tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat cause our lives an instrumental
This is physical and mental
I wouln't sugar coat it
You'll die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation
Dread that like a Haitian
While you muthafckers waiting
I be off the slave ship, building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Just call this shit Hiipower
Nigga nothing less than Hiipower

5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPower

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Now I done grew up
Round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in the dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd move

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
Sex

She just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And she plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)

If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I'm not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated

Man.. Beyonce.. Im mad at you.. Man

They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can day dream about beyonce all day 
thinkin about the good times before she met Jay see ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man until 
I seen the video with a ring on your hand
It hurt me so

I remember you were 16 on the tv screen with wyclef
Were you my type? Oh god yes, I was impressed
You was like no no no
I was like 12 years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin body
Look like you did pilates
Alot of sit ups probably
But bump that I was there from the start
Even When Latoya Luckett and that other doo doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cuz honestly they were just so-so , they couldn't sing anyway you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle I'm just sayin they cool.. But you ? You are somethin like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton Gonzolas park we can build castles in the sand
Eatin hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down you know ill lick your fingers when your finished

They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)

I’m a Nestor Ave…
Nightlife liver, still waiting to grow up
25 cents now or later, and a soda
Snotty-nosed kids slap boxing on the corner
“Hi” – yeah, that’s me right there
Sandy little Jordans and the swoosh in his hair
In the overall shorts – I ain’t have a care
Contact, ‘cause my car’s righ there
I thought I was Pac when ‘Hit ‘Em Up’ came out
Got in trouble for the music, I was playin’ it loud
Read the credits to all the CDs in the house
With the… bottle I was rockin’ the crowd
I was eight when I wrote my first rap line down
Shit, I remember, I was right on the couch
Are you feeling me? Back in third grade I was killing it
If y’all don’t get the metaphor, it’s all elementary
Summertime fun, mack daddy at the pool
Wintertime fun, selling candy at the school
Ready for the action, if it happened, I was cool

His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took
A fifth of henney to the head
In memory of his brother
Reminiscing on them plans
Said they'd go with eachother
He was hurtin
I can see it
Plenty tears
No kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug
Some of his brother's blood got on me
Clenching his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb
And asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had a plan on him
He wanted war
What do you say to a good friend
That's just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet
I tried my best to make him renig
But he was like, my nig
This feeling is more than personal
I stood down
He hopped in a four door, honda accord before he
Binged the block
He said kdot

These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, or war
(Or at least, try to understand) the city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith & Wessons

And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...

Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac brown, looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, one love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3: 30
Telling me it's all good, Tiger Woods, now we looking for the +birdy+ birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers

Like he was my sidekick
We Batman and Robin
Welcome to our private affair
Where, the narrow be right here
Where, the bitches be right here
22 here, you you
Won't you change your life boo
Together we can slide through
Midnight, Murcielago, loud pipes
Make sure that that head right, damn right
I be on that other shit make them want to curse my government
Dayum, hate the game, hate on me
And I'm loving it
I'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly

Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

Jump in the coup and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All cause I'm 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I'm that cool

I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

Reporting live, Compton California
The good kid

I'm tired of doing it
the same way, gotta flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
Opinions get thrown out the window with Ron Browz
So turn me up loud so the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
and go death, go death I said
Go death and stay dead, a shot to the forehead to kill 'em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I'm militant as Martin Luther King and a penalty
Aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
I've got in it my genes, you probably think I'm talking bout a pistol
but I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga, what you worry for? I ain't tryna jock your swag
I'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant, yeah

As time flies, hope that I'm soaring

I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm bout to show 'em
everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature, baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same
modern world, that's your girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on, if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the Black Visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?

Yeah, Punch what's happening brother
Niggas be poppin that shit at me like it's something new to me or something know what I'm talking about
I tell a nigga quick that shit just a rerun to me nigga
I've been doing this shit since Vanguard, brother
And tell me what's happening with it
Niggas hate on me but hop right on my dick as soon as they see me
Soon as they see me they're like

What up dot
That's what they tell me every second around the clock
Everytime I clock in, rappers checking they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MC's I knock off they payroll
How many God MC's I knock off they halo
Hip-Hop ain't dead consumers changed up
Rappers Love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low, like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit, so I fail, guess what I don't even trip
Just like that, crunch a little battle raps
Punchlines, I did that in 99, you think its a gold mine when you think of one
You think you hot, but I think you done
Like queens new york slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right, pay your bills or i'm turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas dreams, thinking they the West Coast kings
Till I drop like visine, tell a nigga quick it ain't always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, Gun clapper, snuff him like a rude capper
Got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off, at ya
