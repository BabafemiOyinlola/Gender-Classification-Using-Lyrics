Where my mind oh Lord, is fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Whoa, I like to greet the sun each mornin'
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey in my life
In my life

It isn't always easy
We've been through a few hard times
But when we stick together
There's no mountain we can't climb

With all that we've been through
And everything we've done
Nothing comes between us we stand as one

United in love there's nothing we can't rise above
United in love whatever happens to us
United in love we'll always be
United in love so united

Looking like a dream out on the floor
You haven't stopped since you walked in the door
I can't take my eyes of you
And I can feel you like me too
But all you wanna do is dance some more

This night was made for love
(This night was made for love)
When you gonna realise

Oh, you can't dance all night
So come home with me
And in the morning light
We'll be lying in extacy, my love

You know how to move
And you do it so right
But you can't dance all night, ooh

Quick before the rythm starts to fade

Let me tell you now

I need you more and more...
You, turned me inside out and you showed me.
What life was about.
Only you, the only one that stole my heart away.
I wanna do all I can, just to show you.
Make you understand.
Only you, the only one that stole my heart away.
When you're in my arms.

Say you will, sing your songs, for evermore, evermore

Oh, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night

But I'm apprehensive
She's so expensive, girl

Just can't get enough
I'm the one who does 9 to 5
Hustlin' for my bread

While she's decidin' what dress to buy
Layin' around in my bed

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me, got me

Drives my Mercedes
Lunch with the ladies
She loves the finer things
What have I created

Now I'm afraid to see what tomorrow brings
She don't know what it does to me trying to keep her in line
If love is just a big charge account

And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey in my life

Horizons that I've never seen

And dream my dream
Oh dream my dream

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind oh Lord, is fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Whoa, I like to greet the sun each mornin'
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey in my life
In my life

It was the fire in your eyes

Flyin' high on a feelin'

Временами я думаю о нас,
Утыкаю себя временами.
Мое сердце бьется раз в час.
Я очень болен другими словами.

Она на полупальцах в тишину.
Я за ней, но менее резво.
Я удивляюсь тому, что дышу
Одним воздухом с ней и остаюсь трезвым.

Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можно знать.
Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можешь знать только ты.
Ты знаешь, я смогу все заново начать только с тобой.

I'm in love with a plain old-fashion girl
She's the most beautiful person in the world

Her smile is so warm and her eyes burn so deep, ah, yeah
Softly in rhymes of love she sings to me

Only if it's meant to be, baby

Yeah, hea, hea, I-I-I-I

I'm in love with a plain and simple girl
She takes my heart and sends me for a whirl
I'm on the wings of love and I don't take care where I go
Because when we reach that star we both will know
{Love is for love} Ooh {And our love was meant to be}

Lookin' back through time we are in debt to the leaders
Angels of mercy everyone

Give us an anchor or a rock to lean on
A captain to take us through the storm

Say you will, sing your songs, for evermore, evermore

On my back

I can feel you creeping up on me.
Such a hungry love on the hunt

Stalking through the night
we're running wild.
In your eyes I'm the prize

in the lion's den I can't get free.
Now we're alone
don't let me go

'Cause you're bringing out the savage beast in me.

My scent's in the air
it's everywhere

I'm gonna be your prey tonight.
I've given up the chase
I'm ready to be tamed

So tonight you better use your

Animal instinct - oh baby
let's set the beast free tonight.

And people tell me, she keeps telling you lies
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh

I know it? s love the way I planned it, I believe in Janet

And she won? t lead me on, Janet, oh, Janet

While she's decidin' what dress to buy

layin' around in my bed.

Goin' to the bank
she got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
she got me

Drives my Mercedes

she loves the finer things.
What have I created

now I'm afraid to see what tomorrow brings.
She don't know what it does to me trying to keep her in line

Я удивляюсь тому, что дышу
Одним воздухом с ней и остаюсь трезвым.

Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можно знать.
Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можешь знать только ты.
Ты знаешь, я смогу все заново начать только с тобой.

Aw girl didn't really have any value at all

There was a lonely man
A man with no direction, with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for, for me
Aw girl then you, then you came into my life
You made my jagged edges smooth
You made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl

You see you're my heart, you're soul
...

Know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leavin' you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can
You see, I beg, stole and I borrowed, yeah, ooh

That's why I'm easy (ahh...)
I'm easy like Sunday morning (ahh...)
That's why I'm easy (ahh...)
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me, yeah

Ow, she's a brick house
She's mighty-mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
That lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

Ow, she's a brick house
Well put-together, everybody knows
This is how the story goes

She knows she got everything
That a woman needs to get a man, yeah, yeah
How can she lose with the stuff she use
Thirty-six, twenty-four, thirty-six oh what a winning hand

'Cause she's a brick house
She's mighty-mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
Ow, that lady stacked and that's a fact

Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you

Yes, you're once, twice, three times alady
And I love you

Sail on down the line 'bout-a half-a mile or so
And-a don't really wanna know-a where you're goin'
Maybe once or twice, you see, time after time

And I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money, and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah
Yes I'll be on my way, I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along, I'm lookin' for a good time

Временами я думаю о нас,
Утыкаю себя временами.
Мое сердце бьется раз в час.
Я очень болен другими словами.

Она на полупальцах в тишину.
Я за ней, но менее резво.
Я удивляюсь тому, что дышу
Одним воздухом с ней и остаюсь трезвым.

Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можно знать.
Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можешь знать только ты.
Ты знаешь, я смогу все заново начать только с тобой.

Saturday, but I've been living for the weekend, girl
to let all my inhibitions go wild, wild and free.
Gonna get away into the night.
Take the girl of my dreams,
don't you know we'll make sweet music.
Saturday, Saturday night.
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right, whoo whoo.
Girl forget the memories of those bad times together.
Let us live at love and make these moments unforgettable.

Hey Lucy why don't you come and settle down
I hear you're the baddest girl this side of town
Got a little money that I wanna spend
If you'll be my friend
For just a little while

First summer you sailed on down to New Orleans
I was a victor, you were a Cajun queen
You had many fellas with lots of style
And you drove them wild
Oh little Lucy I had to be with you

Traveled around the country
