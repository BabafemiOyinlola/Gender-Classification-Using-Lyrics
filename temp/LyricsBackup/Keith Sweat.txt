To the candy store, candy store

I took a trip to where we used to live
… a girl… that name and asking
… as the door, had a sign that said she don't live here no more
Went to the neighbors asked because…
You're the only one for me
Love's the only thing in life that will free
Now all I have left is just a memory

I remember when you were young,
Back in the days …
And the only thing that's better than life
Was the candy store, down on the corner

You and me we're like family girl
And you been telling me for so long, long

About what was going on with your man
How he talks to you, how he treats you, raises his hand
Oh no, see I knew back then that man of yours, he was no damn good
But I left that there, didn't want to come in between it, all along

It's five o'clock in the morning, you wake up and still he ain't made it home
Just remember every word I told you when I said I knew this all along

You gotta have a king

She's so bad, in my eyes

Seen you last night
Saw you standing there
Couldn't picture the color of your hair
All I wanted to know
Were you really there?

I want to know was it my imagination?
Ooh you know it was a sweet sensation
Lookin' at you from a distance
Ooh, It seems so real

You and I together
Dream that seemed for real
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up
It feels so real all I know is

I want her

You know what you wanna do
See, I'll never ever go nowhere yet
Think of all the times

Baby, we've been freakin' from dusk till dawn
And I'm still not ready to go on
That's the way it flows when it gets real good
Back to back flexin' my manhood

(Oh, baby) Why does it got to be so good
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me hooked
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me shook
(Oh, baby) And I ain't goin' nowhere

I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (Girl, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again

I wanna go on and on and on and on

Bobie Doll and Big Jim Picato
Call me up every single day
They don't work and they don't want to
Come on down to some Damn Cafe
Bobie Doll tells me "live in the moment"Don't get too far ahead - don't live in the past
I blink my eyes and the moment is over
I guess another day has passed
But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me

If I go to the club, they just wanna take me home
Just tryin' to have a good time, just wanna get my drink on
If I go to the mall, they come in the store
I'm just tryin' to chill, said, I'm just tryin' to chill

I don't know if they think this is the glamorous life
(I don't know if they think this is)
They wanna share the life with me
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

But what's a girl who gave all of her up in the lights
(Oh, lights)
It won't lead to anything
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'll trade a million bucks
For someone's love who don't come with a price
I'll trade in all my cars
For someone who will love me for life

They can take away my platinum plaques
That fame and fortune won't mean a thing

Got a house on the hill
Ten cars in your driveway
And you never seem to look my way
Cuz I could feel your pain

(So you got a college degree)
You might have a PHD

But it don't matter to me
(Everynight you cry yourself to sleep)
Mmm, cuz you're so lonely

See I had a good life
My own home, my own car, my own dough
Had no stress

And then I let my guard down for a minute
'Cause she was pretty
Thought she was the one for me

Knew it was wrong, shouldn't have did it
But she let me hit it
And I was too damn blind to see
Just what she was doin' to me

Oh no, not me

A choice to make
Will it be me or will it be you?
Let's be honest with each other
There's one thing I don't wanna do

I don't wanna play no games
(I don't wanna play games with you)
If you wanna leave, just leave
(Leave me, yes I'm gonna miss you)
If you're not serious
(Don't wanna waste no time)
If you'll be better off without me
Then I'll be better off without you

Tried to make it last, two damn years
Just couldn't get things right
Crazy love, up and down
Guilty conscience all the time

See a man had to do what a man had to do

Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin' so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you'd jump out of my car and I'd chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day
Where were you, baby
Who was you seein', it's a hurtin' feelin', sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin' me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
'Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin' I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late
You hurt me, baby

She's so bad, in my eyes

Seen you last night
Saw you standing there
Couldn't picture the color of your hair
All I wanted to know
Were you really there?

I want to know was it my imagination?
Ooh you know it was a sweet sensation
Lookin' at you from a distance
Ooh, It seems so real

You and I together
Dream that seemed for real
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up
It feels so real all I know is

I want her
(I want that baby)
I want her
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
I want her
(I wanna do it like this, do it like that)
I want her
(Once I get it ain't no turnin' back)

You turn me on and on
This feelin,' girl, is so strong
My heart, girl, is on fire
Ooh, you're my desire

I've got a thing for you
Dreams of you and me, baby
She's bad, she's bad, she's bad
All I know is

I want her
(I want, I want, I want, I want, I want her)
I want her
(Don't misunderstand me)

Tossin', turnin', girl
I just can't sleep at night
Ooh, you've been cheating on me
Tell me it's a lie, huh

I called you home
And the phone just keeps on ringing
Ooh, baby, what do you think I am
All I wanna do is be your man

I can't sleep at night
For fear someone holdin' you tight
Make you believe you are mine
And it will be ours till the end of time

Something, something, something, something just ain't right
It just ain't right
Something, something, something, something just ain't right

Ooh, you make me feel
So good, so good inside
And the thought of another man holdin' you tight
It makes me wanna cry [Makes me want to cry]

Don't blame me if I get suspicious, baby

You know it's about three o'clock when I looked at the time
And I had two more hours to go before I got to your love
And the time just kept ticking slower and slower
When I got to the front door
I thought about openin' the door with my key that
Seeing your lovely face right in front of me

Girl, I've been thinkin' Âbout you all day long
And I just could not wait, baby, to get home to you
Food, forget about the dinner, oh, honey
ÂCause the only thing I'm hungry for, oh, baby, is you
Just keep it comin', baby, come on

Don't stop your love (No, no)
Don't stop your love
Don't stop your love (I need it right now)
Don't stop your love

Unplug the phone, girl, so we won't be disturbed
But the way I want it, baby, is just you and me
Well, run your fingers through my hair, girl [Run your fingers through my hair], and love me down
ÂCause your lovin' is the only thing tonight, girl, that I need
Just keep it comin', baby, come on

Don't stop your love (No, no, ooh)

(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my heart

Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin' so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you'd jump out of my car and I'd chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day
Where were you, baby
Who was you seein', it's a hurtin' feelin', sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin' me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
'Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin' I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late
You hurt me, baby
But hey, I'm man enough to admit it
What I wanna know is why

(Why, why me, baby) {Tell me why, baby, tell me why}

Hoo, ooh, ooh
Yeah, baby
Mmm... mmm... mmm... mmm...
Feel so good, feel so good

Come on in, baby, have a seat
Take your shoes off, let me massage your feet
You look like you're in the mood for good love
Turn the lights off, girl, that's what I give you plenty of

I wanna be more than a friend
Someone you can depend on
Love you over and over again
Tonight I don't want this love affair to ever end
I love you (Once we get started, it's not gonna stop)

I wanna love you down from your head to your toes

If you ain't trying' to be with me
Then why don't you just up and leave
But if you truly want to stay then
Just let me know, oh, oh yeah girl

You can't keep on running in and out
Out of my life, into my bed

There were nothing you wanted girl that now I would not do for you

And I had two more hours to go before I got to your love
And the time just kept ticking slower and slower
When I got to the front door
I thought about openin' the door with my key that
Seeing your lovely face right in front of me

Girl, I've been thinkin' Âbout you all day long
And I just could not wait, baby, to get home to you
Food, forget about the dinner, oh, honey
ÂCause the only thing I'm hungry for, oh, baby, is you
Just keep it comin', baby, come on

Don't stop your love (No, no)
Don't stop your love

Unplug the phone, girl, so we won't be disturbed
But the way I want it, baby, is just you and me
Well, run your fingers through my hair, girl [Run your fingers through my hair], and love me down

Just keep it comin', baby, come on

She's so bad, in my eyes

Seen you last night
Saw you standing there
Couldn't picture the color of your hair
All I wanted to know
Were you really there?

I want to know was it my imagination?
Ooh you know it was a sweet sensation
Lookin' at you from a distance
Ooh, It seems so real

You and I together
Dream that seemed for real
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up
It feels so real all I know is

Ooh, you're my desire

Could make a man feel so much pain

But you never showed up that day
Where were you, baby
Who was you seein', it's a hurtin' feelin', sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin' me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
'Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin' I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late
