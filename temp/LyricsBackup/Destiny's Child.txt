Second nature
Second nature

Why does love always seem so very hard
It's such a struggle to win the reward
Because I'm playin' with the wrong cards
But I think I got the winnin' hand
There's something different about you, babe
That tells me I can

I say it's easy for the things that I do
Never a question, always a pleasure to
Love you, love you, love you

Baby, I won't say no
The love that you give is so
Abound and I can't let go of this love

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind
Cause each and every time you need me
You give me signs
But when I ask you what's the deal
You hold it all inside

If you wanna be with me
You gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Cause boy I know you want me

Everything ya like is with me
So if you know like I know
This is where ya need to be

Do you ever wonder when he dont come who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone, leaves you alone?
Do you ever wonder when he dont come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Everything he likes is with me

If I was in your shoes I would've had to let him know
From the first sign of him tryin to play
If you want me to stay you gotta let all that go
Oh, but no
You wanna stick around

Over mountains high
Together we'll walk over the bridge

There's a place where you can go
Lay your head down comfortable
And it's always there for sure
Don't you know
And it comes as no surprise
Mountains that you must climb
Sit back don't run away
Have no shame

Sitting on the stairway, hoping that you're okay
Waiting patiently for you to come back to me

And I don't mind the waiting as long as there's still maybe
A possibility for you to be true to me

I'll be sitting on the stairway
Till a quarter till two
With nothing to do baby, yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and think

Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting

Look inside your mirror, I hope that you see clearer
Then look behind yourself and you will find me

Tried to hold on to what we got, but now you're goin'
And I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, lord

You so sexy, imagine how

To hold me right now
Our song's playin'

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Flow through my thighs
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow

And I was in the mirror playing wrong
Like you were here, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

(Ohh ohh)
Give it to me deeper
(Ohh ohh)
Giving me the fever

Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second is playing

Hold me while my hands up

Fantasies were shook up

Before I stepped I'd let you know
Stop playin'

Fall through my hood like you use to

If he had a lucky lady claimin' him

Chapter three, he made it clear that he was single
And he was searchin' for a partner just like me
Chapter four, we landed and he said we just can't end it
'Cause he needed a little more time wit me

Weeks later we datin', takin' me all kinda places
Showing me things I never seen
It was kinda crazy, I'm relatin' to this man
So I gave him every hidden secret part of me

Oh, then it switched what is this overheard your messages
When I questioned you, you said she's a friend
Now it's funny that I'm runnin' into you, is that your group

Now you act like we weren't doin' it

So prove yourself to me and the girl that your playin'

Shouldn't be a reason why your acting strange
Nobody's holding you back from me

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Caramel complexion
With the sexiest expression
Curly hair and corn rows
Very nice physique in his nice clothes
He looked at me
I looked at him
He asked me what I was thinking
Because he was so beautiful
I didn't know what to say to him

He was what I wanted
Exactly what I needed
He was what I fantasized
He was what I dreamed
And it would be so perfect
If him and me was we
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings?
We were meant to be

I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

Sexy lips, platinum wrists
Ten tips like he gets manicures
I can't resist those eyes of his

I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able
I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

Woke up and realized
This world's not so bad after all
Looked at it through a child's eyes
And I saw these beautiful
Things that you never think about
Like the ocean, moonlight, stars and clouds
It's amazing how we don't
Appreciate our blessings

There's plenty of people who don't like me
But there's ten times more who love me
And I love myself
Sometimes, it gets tough, it gets tough
But I can't give up, can't give up
Just take a deep breath, close my eyes
Feel the love and give a smile

I woke up this morning
The sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face

And mostly
What I need from you

I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize

Ooh
Can't hear myself (no nooo)
Can you please turn me up a little bit more

I was a little different
I didn't do what the fast girls do
You studied my rhythm
Now you can speed me up when you want to oooh

They were to cool to run my race
You kept the pace with a smile on ya face
Go head baby (go head baby)
Then I knew he was you (then I knew it was you!)

But first you took me around
duced me to your family and friends
And told them how that once we met that
We would never lose
Oh boy

I decided that you are the him for me (I decided)
Oh boy
Cuz I decided that you are the him for me (yes you are)
Oh my boy

How's it feel to win it

(Uh-huh, ready, uh-huh)

C'mon

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi-hat, and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B
(Boy, you hurtin' that)

Brooklyn Bay, where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, your smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

If he ain't got it right by now scratch him off

Said it's about twenty strong
They standing at the door don't wanna take us on
The ring let it go 'bout three months ago
The pain the stressin’
Ain’t in me no more
The girl that they used to know done changed
Now they sayin' Ms. before they reachin' my name

Something that makes me know everythin's gon' be alright
There's somethin' in the way that the stars align
There's not a single moment I'm a pass by

The hour's now
The bass is loud
The disco lights
Shinin' through the crowd
We're holdin' time in our hands and it stops when we say
We say
And we ain't stoppin' 'til the morning light

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stoppin' for no one
The night is young
Don't let them turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done
When we break the dawn

We break the dawn

Ooh there somethin' on the surface right now
Somethin' the keeps me movin' diggin' deeper down

Thinkin' maybe we can make a combination

Wanna see me lose my breath and wanna hear me moan
Better be ready, we'll enable when we get alone
You was talkin' confident upon the telephone
So you gotta put it in when we get it on

No turnin' back from this party
Put you through enough to complain
Ain't no comin' down from this side
My love, don't go nowhere the sunset

Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me

Hello Heartbreak

Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak

I got a strange connection to pain
I can't seem to walk away from hurt
I'm always running into danger zone
I need protection, a change
What is affection? It's I'm longing for
It cuts me deep, but I'm still wanting more

Hello, heartbreak
It's good to see you
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hey there, sadness
I knew I'd meet you
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around

Now that you're out of my life

You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million

Oh so beautiful.

And the party is still going strong.
There's a conversation in the corner,
Tell a friend, bring everyone.

Cause the FM music is groovin',
Folks getting down, getting down in their stocking feet.
Sleepy eyes are peeping,

From the window across the street.

So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

To find release

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't

And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind

Trapped in the moment, only you get in

Never let your feeling get you down

Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things

And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?

Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

You live and learn, this world keeps on turning round,
Sometimes those rainy days
Seem like they last forever
Wish I could turn the page,
And move on (and move on)

Been longing for the days when you used to sit here talking,

Trynna keep my spirits high so I can walk in,

Used to be right next to me
All the things you dream about when you're retained,
Now it seems like everything's so far away,

Saying, girl you'll be fine,
I heard a word,
That would ease my troubled mind.

Took all the hurt away,
Warmed me up inside like a summer day,

Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely

Pay my own car note, oh and I pay my own bills

Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me

On the 8th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring
On the 7th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A nice back rub and he massaged my feet
On the 6th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A crotch jacket with dirty denim jeans
On the 5th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
The poem that he wrote for me

The feeling that I feel is
So good

Feel so in

My man, my man, my baby
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so sexy

It's been a long year
And alot has happened
But the time is here (holidays)
See, I'm headed home
And I'm so excited
It's where I belong (home for the holidays)

I can already see mama's Christmas tree
Surrounded by all the family
Presents everywhere and we're so happy
I can already feel how I feel inside
Just to see my little nephew smile
The gifts that we bring only last a while
(Memories last lifetimes)

We think of all the love
Bring all the joy, (holidays)
To just give more (ring the phone)
I'm coming home for the holidays
We think of all the smiles
I think of love
With all my family and friend (I'll be home)
I'm coming home for the holidays

You know Dasher and Dancer and
Prancer and Vixen comet and Cupid and
Donner and Blitzen but do you recall?
The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

It's the family prayer, it's that new V.S. underwear

It's that broke shiz-nit after givin' all them gifts

Knowing it's a season for giving
Running downstairs for mom's cooking

Chapter one, LAX departure

If he had a lucky lady claimin' him

Chapter three, he made it clear that he was single
And he was searchin' for a partner just like me
Chapter four, we landed and he said we just can't end it
'Cause he needed a little more time wit me

Weeks later we datin', takin' me all kinda places
Showing me things I never seen
It was kinda crazy, I'm relatin' to this man
So I gave him every hidden secret part of me

Oh, then it switched what is this overheard your messages
When I questioned you, you said she's a friend
Now it's funny that I'm runnin' into you, is that your group
Nigga tell her I'm your main event

After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin' it

Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change

Any other day
I would call and you would say
Baby how's your day
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word
Is uh-huh yeah ok
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady
If you took it there
First of all, let me say
I am not the one
To sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me
I am the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the thangs
That you said to me yesterday

I know you say that i am assuming things
Something's going down thats the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you useually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name

Uh uh, hey baby, how you?
Why yo' face lookin’ all sad and blue
Don’t you like the Navigator truck that I brought you
Why you trying to act a fool?

Don’t try to say you seen me
Talking to your girlfriends
Ask Tonya and Shirl then
Gimme a place and time when
Don’t try to accuse me of silly stuff
That I’m doing on the streets

You gotta remember
Without you, there’s no me
I’m just an average man
Tryin’ to make it in this cold world
Tell me baby, why you trippin’, girl?

I don't wanna fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
'Cause boy, I am locking you out

You should think twice
About the way you been talkin' to me

Went from a dream to the young supremes

Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place another time
Touching many hearts along the way yeah
Hopin' that I'll never have to say
(Boy I love you but I gotta let you go)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusion
Trapped in a world only you get in
My minds playin' tricks on me again
Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusion
Trapped in a world only you get in
My minds playin' tricks on me again

Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air
Never let your feelin' let you down
Open up your eyes and look around

Thoughts of you bring illusion
Trapped in a world only you get in

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your cheque next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?

The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin and
I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me
if i needed a friend
he took me to his house and then he
invited me in...
when we sat on the couch
he put his arms around my waist
knowin i needed lovin and then he
grabbed my face
he kissed me like a guy could never
kiss a girl before
so you know what happened baby
i need to say no more

(chorus)
I'm just confessing
about the things i did
I might-as-well come clean
what you feel about that baby
I'm just confessing
bout the things i did
I might-as-well come clean

But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already had my mailbox full

So what
You bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what

Even if the Pope he said he likes you too

Hey ladies why is it that men can go do us wrong
Why is it that we just decide to keep holdin' on
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave
But he's got to go, he's got to go
My man's been cheatin' on me
Been runnin' round here wit' this little tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin' funny
Takin' too long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all is that he gave her money
Now how he gon' give her my ends
That's a no, no

But I just ain't for sure

It had been many years since I've been in love
With a real man, I had given up on love
I didn't think a good man existed in this world
I was tired of searching
Because relationships I've dealt with in the past
Couldn't fathom bein' monogamous
When I least expected it, I found you
And because of you I know how it feels to be

(Love)
And when I look into your eyes I see
(Love)
Pillow talk at night and I can hear
(Love)
Oh, the next mornin' we make
(Love)
I'm so in love

Through you I live and love again
(Again)
Open the path to happiness
(Na)
Through you I learn to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
(Na)
I trust you just guide me take my hand
(Na)
Through you I learn to smile again
I love you
(I love you)
I love you
(I love you)

Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doin' things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
Ya but I'll never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share my life, so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

(Love)
And when I look into your eyes I see
(Love)
Pillow talk at night and I can hear

You Had your dreams
And i had mine
Eyes wide open
And we dreamed together
I never know how we keep
Our shit together
& I'm wondering
Is this love or Illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a Quatum Level

It's Nuclear
We're two here
Yjere's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would u run?
It's Nuclear
We're two here
We both heat up

What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do

But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight? Ooh baby

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

Don't you know there's
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
And don't you know there's

Hey

They'll know it when they see you rollin' impala's around
(I got a Soldier)
Wit the top down feeling the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shot it wit Chelle and kick it wit Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be G's you way outta your league, please

We like Dem boys that be in them lac's leanin'
(Leanin')
Open their mouth their grill gleamin'

Candy paint, keep that whip clean and
(Clean and)
They always be talkin that country slang, we like

They keep that beat that be in the back beatin'
(Beatin')
Eyes be so low from that chief
(Chief and)
I love how he keep my body screamin'

A rude boy that's good to me, wit street credibility

If your status ain't hood

Betta be street if he lookin' at me

That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

If your status ain't hood

That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he betta be street

We like Dem boys up top from the BK

(Three ways)
Always ridin' big on the freeway

Low cut Caesars wit the deep waves

Always comin' down poppin' our way

Tellin' us that country girls the kinda girl they like

Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers
And they're pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:  30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Oh, he sayin' he got a girl
Yes, it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Last week and you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man
He was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to stop you
You're going off

And your nails done, too
With your outfit and you're fitting the shoes
Who parlaying at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the fellas
Rollin' in the Lexus, trucks, and hummers

Oh, he sayin' he got a girl
Yes, it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill

So, you and me are through

And tell us what's been happening

Don't you try to convince us that you're happy

We've seen this all before
But he's taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you

Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya

See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy

I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling ya

So let's make it hot hot

All you ladies leave your man at home

And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends
Cuz it's 11: 30 and the club is jumpin jumpin

Ladies leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends

Call your boys cuz tonight you're not gonna stay at home
Tell your girl she aint comin that you're goin solo

You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your hair cut and your car washed too

You need to look your best cuz your turnin heads
Tonight your gonna find a sexy chica thats gonna

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week
(Bridge)
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard

Listen

You know I've had my share of ups and downs,
You live and learn, this world keeps on turning round,
Sometimes those rainy days
Seem like they last forever
Wish I could turn the page,
And move on (and move on)

Been longing for the days when you used to sit here talking,
(All through the night)
Trynna keep my spirits high so I can walk in,
(into your life)
Used to be right next to me
All the things you dream about when you're retained,
Now it seems like everything's so far away,
Then one day you know

I heard a word,
Saying, girl you'll be fine,
I heard a word,
That would ease my troubled mind.

Took all the hurt away,
Warmed me up inside like a summer day,

A pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring

A nice back rub and he massaged my feet
On the 6th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A crotch jacket with dirty denim jeans
On the 5th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
The poem that he wrote for me

So good

Feel so in

Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so sexy

Take a minute girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy

We've seen this all before
But he's taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you

Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya

See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy

I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling ya

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second of every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Of giving up
Of suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

Shouldn't be a reason why your acting strange
Nobody's holding you back from me

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second of every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Of giving up
Of suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your cheque next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?

Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies

Why does love always seem so very hard
It's such a struggle to win the reward
Because I'm playin' with the wrong cards
But I think I got the winnin' hand
There's something different about you, babe
That tells me I can

I say it's easy for the things that I do

Do you ever wonder when he don't come home who he goes to see

From the first sign of him tryin' to play
If you want me to stay you gotta let all that go
Oh, but no

And while your waiting, thinkin' everything is gonna be ok

But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind?

'Cause each and every time you near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you what's the deal
You hold it all inside

If you wanna be with me
You gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel

'Cause boy, I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come and get my love

Who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
Cuz everything he like is with me

If I was in your shoes

From the first sign of him tryin' to play
If you want me to stay
Ya gotta let all that go
Oh no, you wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And while you're waitin'
Thinkin' everything's gonna be OK

Waiting patiently for you to come back to me

And I don't mind the waiting as long as there's still maybe
A possibility for you to be true to me

I'll be sitting on the stairway
Till a quarter till two
With nothing to do baby, yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and think

Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting

Look inside your mirror, I hope that you see clearer
Then look behind yourself and you will find me

Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your cheque next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?

Hey ladies why is it that men can go do us wrong
Why is it that we just decide to keep holdin' on
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave
But he's got to go, he's got to go
My man's been cheatin' on me
Been runnin' round here wit' this little tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin' funny
Takin' too long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all is that he gave her money
Now how he gon' give her my ends
That's a no, no
My first reactions telling me he's got to go, go
But I just ain't for sure

When he told me, he never seen a chick before
He wouldn't give me no explaination
Cause he knows when I pack my bags it ain't for no vacation

Oh I'm moving on my way

And I don't really wanna know, where you're goin'
Maybe once or twice you see, time after time I tried
Tried to hold on to what we got, but now you're goin'
And I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know, I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Guess I'll be on my way
I won't be back to say

It's too far
It's too fast
It's too quick
It won't last

It's not right
But it's not wrong
There's no time
Move along

But I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
And I know what I feel
I can tell when it is real
My time has come

It's okay
Be afraid
It's alright
You just take that fear

Turn it in
To your strength
It's called life
And that's why we're here

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your cheque next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?

The day you pissed me off I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin' and I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me if I needed a friend
He took me to his house and then he invited me in

Then we sat on the couch, he put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin' then he gently grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before
So you know what happened baby, I need to say no more

I'm just confessing about some things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby?

I'm just guessing that you through with me
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just guessing, are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that? two

Remember the time you wondered where your money went
I called my friends and bought some clothes and took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a jeep and we talked all the time
He asked me 'bout my man and you know that I had to lie

Hey ladies why is it that men can go do us wrong
Why is it that we just decide to keep holdin' on
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave
But he's got to go, he's got to go
My man's been cheatin' on me
Been runnin' round here wit' this little tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin' funny
Takin' too long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all is that he gave her money
Now how he gon' give her my ends
That's a no, no

Last week and you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man
He was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to stop you
You're going off

You got your hair done
And your nails done, too
With your outfit and you're fitting the shoes
Who parlaying at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the fellas
Rollin' in the Lexus, trucks, and hummers

Shouldn't be a reason why your acting strange
Nobody's holding you back from me

Sometimes I do get lonely
No you and no one to hold me
You want so much to lay me down
Is that what keeps you hanging 'round?
Is that the only way to win your heart?

Well if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay

If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay

I'll be, be yours forever
But can we keep us together?

Curly hair and corn rows
Very nice physique in his nice clothes
He looked at me

He asked me what I was thinking
Because he was so beautiful

He was what I wanted
Exactly what I needed
He was what I fantasized
He was what I dreamed
And it would be so perfect
If him and me was we
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings?
We were meant to be

I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

Sexy lips, platinum wrists
Ten tips like he gets manicures
I can't resist those eyes of his

The sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able
I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

Woke up and realized
This world's not so bad after all
Looked at it through a child's eyes
And I saw these beautiful
Things that you never think about
Like the ocean, moonlight, stars and clouds
It's amazing how we don't
Appreciate our blessings

There's plenty of people who don't like me
But there's ten times more who love me
And I love myself
Sometimes, it gets tough, it gets tough
But I can't give up, can't give up
Just take a deep breath, close my eyes
Feel the love and give a smile

I woke up this morning

Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
And don't you know there's

Remember the first day when I saw your face?
Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about

Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies although we tried to hide
And we both had a beautiful night

The way we held each others hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love

I know that he loves me 'cause its obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause its me he trust
...

I love you
I love you
I love you

Baby I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation and connection to the sun
You next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome

You are my raindrops, I am the sea
You and God who's my sunlight, I'm blooming, grown so beautifully
Baby I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and misty world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just, just keep loving me the way I love you loving me

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me

I know you love me, love me for who I am

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

It was a Saturday
This cold afternoon
Inside this house there lived a frightened young girl
She didn't know what she should do
'Cuz she missed her mother so
She was left home all alone with her stepfather

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

He touched her places
That he shouldn't have touched
He did some things to her
That he shouldn't have done

You've been so good to me
Thank you, Lord, Hallelujah

You are my best friend
You been right here through thick and thin
You are my best friend
Gotten me through places I have been
You are my best friend
Through our situations
You have been my inspiration
My best friend
Your still here and I love you

I think you got angel wings
Hiding up under there somewhere
Michelle, my belle
Dunno where we would be if we never met you girl
I love you, I thank you
You such a blessing
I am so grateful
I truly believe the Lord sent you to me and Kelly
The smile the laughter always makes me happy
When I am too serious or too intense
With a voice that beautiful you was heaven sent

My sister my life couldn't be better
Doing what I love with my best friend
And making Cheddar Kelly
The most beautifulest girl in the world
You are my survivor and I admire you
You have no idea how special you are
Humble, talented and blessed you are
Sometimes I wish I could be more like you
Sometimes they don't wanna give your credit to you
Wouldn't be a Destiny's Child if it wasn't for you
DC-3 forever I'm thanking you

Lord thank you for your vision that we see down here on earth
Thank you for your precious gifts
Your sweet precious gift of love

Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?

Why does love always seem so very hard
It's such a struggle to win the reward
Because I'm playin' with the wrong cards
But I think I got the winnin' hand
There's something different about you, babe
That tells me I can

I say it's easy for the things that I do
Never a question, always a pleasure to
Love you, love you, love you

Baby, I won't say no
The love that you give is so
Abound and I can't let go of this love

Sitting on the stairway, hoping that you're okay
Waiting patiently for you to come back to me
(What should I do)
And I don't mind the waiting as long as there's still maybe
A possibility for you to be true to me

I'll be sitting on the stairway
Till a quarter till two
With nothing to do baby, yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and think

Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting

Look inside your mirror, I hope that you see clearer
Then look behind yourself and you will find me

Thinking about all these things

Why is this pressure all on me?
Why this negativity?
If something's wrong blame it on me

Shut up, no one said to open your mouth
Shut up, if you do not like me how about
Shut up, why waste your energy on me?
Shut up, is it, 'cause you wanna be me?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Caramel complexion
With the sexiest expression
Curly hair and corn rows
Very nice physique in his nice clothes
He looked at me
I looked at him
He asked me what I was thinking
Because he was so beautiful
I didn't know what to say to him

He was what I wanted
Exactly what I needed
He was what I fantasized
He was what I dreamed
And it would be so perfect
If him and me was we
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings?
We were meant to be

I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

Sexy lips, platinum wrists
Ten tips like he gets manicures
I can't resist those eyes of his

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on
When every second with every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness or giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

What you think about a girl like me?
Buy my own car and spend my own money
Only ring your celly when I'm feeling lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave

Please don't call me baby 'cause I'll call you
Don't mean to hurt you feelings, got a lot to do
'Cause I am my number one priority
No falling in love, no commitment from me

All my independent women, throw them hands up at me
And all my sexy women, throw them hands up at me
All my money making women, throw them hands up at me
All my baller women, throw them hands up at me

If you feel it throw them hands up
Where them hands at if you feel it
Where the ladies? Where my home girls?
Where my females? Where all my women?

Try to control me, boy, you'll get dismissed
Do what I want, live how I wanna live
Buy my own diamonds, and I pay my own bills

You thought I wouldn't grow without you now I'm wiser

And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight? Ooh baby

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

Nobody left in this world to hold me tight

Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?

Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers
And they're pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:  30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Oh, he sayin' he got a girl
Yes, it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Last week and you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man
He was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to stop you
You're going off

You got your hair done
And your nails done, too
With your outfit and you're fitting the shoes
Who parlaying at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the fellas
Rollin' in the Lexus, trucks, and hummers

You thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million

You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top

When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already had my mailbox full

So what
You bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what
My momma likes you (Likes you)
What now I guess you think I will too
Even if the Pope he said he likes you too

Something's going down thats the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me

I didn't think a good man existed in this world

Couldn't fathom bein' monogamous
When I least expected it, I found you
And because of you I know how it feels to be

And when I look into your eyes I see

Through you I learn to smile again

Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doin' things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
Ya but I'll never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share my life, so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

(Love)
And when I look into your eyes I see
(Love)
Pillow talk at night and I can hear

You Had your dreams
And i had mine
Eyes wide open
And we dreamed together
I never know how we keep
Our shit together
& I'm wondering
Is this love or Illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a Quatum Level

It's Nuclear
We're two here
Yjere's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would u run?
It's Nuclear
We're two here
We both heat up

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second of every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Of giving up
Of suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

Second nature
Second nature

Why does love always seem so very hard
It's such a struggle to win the reward
Because I'm playin' with the wrong cards
But I think I got the winnin' hand
There's something different about you, babe
That tells me I can

I say it's easy for the things that I do
Never a question, always a pleasure to
Love you, love you, love you

Baby, I won't say no
The love that you give is so
Abound and I can't let go of this love

Cause each and every time you need me

Do you ever wonder when he don't come who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Leaves you alone?
Do you ever wonder when he don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Everything he likes is with me

If I was in your shoes I would've had to let him know
From the first sign of him tryin' to play
If you want me to stay you gotta let all that go
Oh, but no

You wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And while your waiting, thinkin' everything is gonna be okay
I gotta him, I gotta him right here with me, oh ho

Do you ever wonder when he don't come who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Leaves you alone?
Do you ever wonder when he don't come home who he goes to see

There's a place where you can go
Lay your head down comfortable
And it's always there for sure

Mountains that you must climb
Sit back don't run away

Sitting on the stairway, hoping that you're okay
Waiting patiently for you to come back to me

And I don't mind the waiting as long as there's still maybe
A possibility for you to be true to me

I'll be sitting on the stairway
Till a quarter till two
With nothing to do baby, yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and think

Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time, waiting on you, what should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting

Look inside your mirror, I hope that you see clearer
Then look behind yourself and you will find me

Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your cheque next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?

The day you pissed me off I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin' and I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me if I needed a friend
He took me to his house and then he invited me in

Then we sat on the couch, he put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin' then he gently grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before
So you know what happened baby, I need to say no more

I'm just confessing about some things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby?

I'm just guessing that you through with me
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just guessing, are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that? two

Remember the time you wondered where your money went
I called my friends and bought some clothes and took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a jeep and we talked all the time
He asked me 'bout my man and you know that I had to lie

You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on
When every second with every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness or giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I bought it
The rock I'm rockin'

'Cause I depend on me
If I want it

The house I live in

Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollars

Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul

Shut up

Survivor (Remix Extended Version)"(feat. Da Brat
Welcome to the wonderful world of Destiny's Child
I'm Da Brat-tat-tat, my homeboy Den on the track
and we gon' lay you flat on yo' back

So from now, until we dead and gone

Beyonce, where you at? Uhh!

Now that you're outta my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without ya, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without ya, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without ya, I love harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without ya, now I'm wiser!
You thought that I'd be helpless without ya but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without ya, but I'm chillin
You thought I wouldn't sell without ya, sold nine million

I'ma survivor (WHAT), I'm not gon' give up (WHAT)

Lucy Liu... with my girl, Drew... Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, Come on
Uh uh uh

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships

The shoes on my feet
I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I wanted
the watch I'm wearin'
I've bought it
The house I live in
I've bought it
The car I'm driving

Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my card
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends

You know I've had my share of ups and downs,
You live and learn, this world keeps on turning round,
Sometimes those rainy days
Seem like they last forever
Wish I could turn the page,
And move on (and move on)

Been longing for the days when you used to sit here talking,
(All through the night)
Trynna keep my spirits high so I can walk in,
(into your life)
Used to be right next to me
All the things you dream about when you're retained,
Now it seems like everything's so far away,
Then one day you know

I heard a word,
Saying, girl you'll be fine,
I heard a word,
That would ease my troubled mind.

Took all the hurt away,
Warmed me up inside like a summer day,

Chapter one, LAX departure
Flight 1106, he sat right next to me
Chapter two, he was cute so I asked him
If he had a lucky lady claimin' him

Chapter three, he made it clear that he was single
And he was searchin' for a partner just like me
Chapter four, we landed and he said we just can't end it
'Cause he needed a little more time wit me

Weeks later we datin', takin' me all kinda places
Showing me things I never seen
It was kinda crazy, I'm relatin' to this man
So I gave him every hidden secret part of me

Oh, then it switched what is this overheard your messages
When I questioned you, you said she's a friend
Now it's funny that I'm runnin' into you, is that your group
Nigga tell her I'm your main event

Why you actin' like you don't know who I am?
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know

Girl I know your man
I drove his whip, I bought his rims
And I know it's gone hurt you provin' it

Why you actin' like you don't know who I am?
After all the trips, all time we spent
You gone act like we weren't doin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know?

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on
When every second with every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness or giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name

It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight? Ooh baby

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

Don't you know there's
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
And don't you know there's

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles

'Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block

'Cause you a bug-a boo
You buggin' what?
You buggin' who?
You buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool

It's not hot
That you be callin' me stressin me pagin' my beeper you're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages every 10 minutes and then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already had my mailbox full

So what
You bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what
My momma likes you (Likes you)
What now I guess you think I will too
Even if the Pope he said he likes you too
I don't really care 'cause you're a bug a boo

I can tell you, I know you need me to show you, but, it's better if I hear it from you.
You know what, let me explain myself.

It's 7 am you're still here with me, and last night I held you tightly so.
What does that mean, you see I know what it means to me.
It means that I, I, wouldn't let you go.
Tell me, is your heart still spinning from the night before?

And you really need to let me know are you here just for, (sexual dealings).

Girl, you don't have to be hiding, don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you

I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you
See, what y'all don't know about him is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job and I ain't making it easy

I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes but I need my man, I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling ya

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second, and every minute another soul is gone?
And I believe that in my life I will
see(oh yea) an end to hopelessness, of giving
up, of suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one wil be left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
...

Baby I see you working hard
I want to let you know I'm proud
Let you know that I admire what you do
The more if I need to reassure you

My life would be purposeless without you (yeah)
If I want it (got it)
When I ask you (you provide it)

You inspire me to be better
You challenge me for the better
Sit back and let me pour out my love letter
Let me help you

Take off your shoes
Untie your shoe strings
Take off your cufflinks (yeah)
What you want to eat, boo? (yeah)

Let me feed you
Let me run your bathwater
Whatever you desire, I'll suply ya

Sing you a song
Turn my game on
I'll brush your hair
Help put your do-rag on

Want a foot rub (yeah)
You want a manicure
Baby I'm yours I wanna cater 2 u boy
Let me cater 2 u
Cause baby this is your day
Do anything for my man

Baby you blow me away
I got your slippers
Your dinner
Your dessert and so much more

Anything you want
Let me cater 2 u
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart

Better move, 'cuz we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
The baddest chick, check this out

Spotted me, a tender thang
There you are, come on, baby
Don't you wanna dance with me?
Can you handle, handle me?

You gotta do much better
If you gon' dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you gon' dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

'Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
'Cause you a bug-a boo
You buggin' what?

You buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool

It's not hot
That you be callin' me stressin me pagin' my beeper you're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages every 10 minutes and then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already had my mailbox full

So what
You bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what
My momma likes you (Likes you)
What now I guess you think I will too
Even if the Pope he said he likes you too
I don't really care 'cause you're a bug a boo

Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move

It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight? Ooh baby

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

Don't you know there's
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
And don't you know there's

Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers
And they're pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:  30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Oh, he sayin' he got a girl
Yes, it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Last week and you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man
He was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to stop you
You're going off

You got your hair done
And your nails done, too
With your outfit and you're fitting the shoes
Who parlaying at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the fellas
Rollin' in the Lexus, trucks, and hummers

Oh, he sayin' he got a girl
Yes, it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

All you ladies leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers
And they're pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:  30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Ladies, leave your man at home

And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends

"Baby how's your day?" But today it ain't the same
Every other word is a, yeah okay
Could it be that you are at the crib wit another lady?
If you took it there, first of all let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me and the girl that you're playin'
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you sayin' I'm assuming things
Something's goin' down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
Nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name

Now I let you out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you sold 9 million

I'm a survivor I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor I'm gonna make it
I will survive keep on survivin'

You thought I couldn't see without you perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now but it won't stop

Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast, baby, now I can't find you

Ooh

All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

In your face I can see the pain, don't you try to convince us that you're happy
We've seen this all before, but he's taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone

You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you
Girl, I can tell you've been crying and you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying and pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding, don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you

I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you
See, what y'all don't know about him is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job and I ain't making it easy

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?

So, you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my card
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
