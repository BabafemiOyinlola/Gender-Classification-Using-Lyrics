She's simply awesome.
She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

I was in search of a good time
Running my game, yeah
Love was the furthest from my mind

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you
...

I live the same old dream
Day and night
Memories of love I knew
I couldn't live my life or so it seemed
My heart cried out for only you

Oh I believe in love
But I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart could mend if given time
I know why love is forever
Love is forever with you

Ooh ooh ooh

If I had to paint a pictures
To show the world how love can really be

You would see I've always loved you right from the very start

Tell me what is the colour of love?
What do you see?

I ve seen the seven wonders
Of the world on display
I ve seen the loveliest of girls
From London to L.A.

Oh but nothing and nobody
Compares to the beauty of you
There s no-one like you
So I take this time to make a pledge
Of a love that will always be true

Promise me your undying love
Together you and I
We ll watch the rest of the world pass us by
Promises are so easily broken
The moment they are spoken
But go ahead and promise me

I ve known the pleasure and the pain

They say a man's home is his castle
So at home man is king
But what's a home or a castle
Without a queen
Now when a man and a women fall in love
It's like a beautiful gift from above
But bitches be trippin like they lost their damn mind
Now I ain't sayin' stop fuckin' with these hoes but c'mon playa
Look for the damn signs
Oooooowwwww
What happened here?
Right below my cabinet mirror
There used to be two brushes
Now there's three toothbrushes
I never said I was a mathematician
But from now on she gonna have to ask permission
If she wanna leave shit here, what's this here?
It's a brazier, gotta get this clear
Run up out the bathroom cursing up a storm
Didn't see there was a purse up on my floor
My foot gets caught up in the strap
Splat, I fall flat, on my back
...

And so i decided to write you this song

She's simply awesome.
She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

I was in search of a good time
Running my game, yeah
Love was the furthest from my mind

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory

When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

THERE'LL BE SAD SONGS TO MAKE YOU CRY
Billy Ocean

Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside
Is there another in your memory?

Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?
I always stop and think of you
Especially when the words of love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry,
Love songs often do,
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you, I love you
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I live the same old dream
Day and night
Memories of love I knew
I couldn't live my life or so it seemed
My heart cried out for only you

Oh I believe in love
But I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart could mend if given time
I know why love is forever
Love is forever with you
...

Ooh ooh ooh

If I had to paint a pictures
To show the world how love can really be
I would use the brightest colours
To create a vision of harmony
It would be a reality
'Cause its only what's inside of my heart
You would see I've always loved you right from the very start

Tell me what is the colour of love?
What do you see?

I ve seen the seven wonders
Of the world on display
I ve seen the loveliest of girls
From London to L.A.

Oh but nothing and nobody
Compares to the beauty of you
There s no-one like you
So I take this time to make a pledge
Of a love that will always be true

Promise me your undying love
Together you and I
We ll watch the rest of the world pass us by
Promises are so easily broken
The moment they are spoken
But go ahead and promise me

I ve known the pleasure and the pain

Stop me if you've heard it all before girl
Stop me there'll be no more to say
I'd give you the world
If the world was mine to give
I would hold you dear
For as long as I live
Darling you and I
We could light up the world
An ordinary guy
With a wonderful girl
The richer we can be
Richer than a millionaire
We'd have everything
Money just couldn't buy
Fancy diamond rings

You are to me as sweet as apple pie
You're next to me, we'll reach the highest high
Oh, can't you see it could be ecstasy
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I

Turn down the light, we'll turn 'em way down low
No need to fight, we'll take it nice and slow
Baby, tonight, we gotta let go
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know

Stay the night
You're a woman, I'm a man
Stay the night
We can do what things you planned

Stay the night
Stay the night
Stay the night

We're all alone, there's only you and I
Pull out the phone, we'll kiss the world goodbye
We'll stay at home and make it on our own

You have to learn to pace yourself
Pressure

You're just like everybody else
Pressure

You've only had to run so far
So good
But you will come to a place

Are loaded guns in your face
And you'll have to deal with
Pressure

You used to call me paranoid
Pressure

But even you can not avoid
Pressure

You turned the tap dance into your crusade

I said my heart would never break
I coulda tried to meet you halfway
But now and then we make mistakes
Oh, I shoulda tried to change your mind
Beggin' you to stay

And I stood by watchin' while you hurt inside
Oh, I shoulda seen it in your eyes
But I didn't realize

Thought that I could take losin' you, but I just make it
I know that I could win, but being alone just won't do
Being on my own
Everything's so different without you

Dancing where the grooves are right (all night)

No need to fight, we'll take it nice and slow
Baby, tonight, we gotta let go
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know

Ooohh yeah

Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you
...

I live the same old dream
Day and night
Memories of love I knew
I couldn't live my life or so it seemed
My heart cried out for only you

Oh I believe in love
But I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart could mend if given time
I know why love is forever
Love is forever with you
...

Ooh, ooh, ooh
If I had to paint a picture
To show the world how true love can really be
I would use the brightest colours
To create a vision of harmony

It would be a reality
'Cause it's only what's inside of my heart
You would see I've always loved you
Right from the very start

Tell me what is the colour of love?
What do you see?
Is it warm, is it tender
When you think of me
I'll see the colour of love
When I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting
Of a love forever true

The colours of the rainbow turn grey
...

"Sorry" is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don´t come easily
Like "Sorry", like "Sorry"

"Forgive me" is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don´t come easily

I ve seen the seven wonders
Of the world on display
I ve seen the loveliest of girls
From London to L.A.

Oh but nothing and nobody
Compares to the beauty of you
There s no-one like you
So I take this time to make a pledge
Of a love that will always be true

Promise me your undying love
Together you and I
We ll watch the rest of the world pass us by
Promises are so easily broken
The moment they are spoken
But go ahead and promise me

I ve known the pleasure and the pain

Ooh yeah

You give me such inspiration
Day by day
You are my reason to smile
And I know that come what may
It's great world anyway
Heart to heart we can face any test
Could it be together we're the best
No matter what they say
It's a great world anyway
Oh it's because of you
I can face it all even though my back against the wall

In time of uncertainty
You are there for me
To guide me on and take to the limit with love

They all say it could never last
We'll prove them wrong

if you wake up in the dead of night
to feel alone like a helpless child
reach out for me I'll be close to you
I need to touch you, that's all I wanna do
and I fell a place of glory when I'm in your arms
ooh, I love to love you darling
don't care how many times
when you take me to your heaven
then I know that you're mine

Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, mm-mm
Singin', don't worry, baby, don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright

Rise up this mornin', smile with the risin' sun
Three little birds pitched by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Sayin', this is my message to you

Oh, don't worry, don't you worry about a thing, oh no no no

Red light spells danger
Can't hold out much longer
'Cos red light means warning
Can't hold out I'm burning

No, no, no

You took my heart and turned me on
And now the danger sign is on
Never thought the day would come
When I would feel alone without you
An' now I'm like a child again
Calling out his mama's name
You got me on a ball and chain
Doin' things that I don't wanta.

I can't stop running to you
Feel love coming through you

Stop me if you've heard it all before girl
Stop me there'll be no more to say
I'd give you the world
If the world was mine to give
I would hold you dear
For as long as I live
Darling you and I
We could light up the world
An ordinary guy
With a wonderful girl
The richer we can be
Richer than a millionaire
We'd have everything
Money just couldn't buy
Fancy diamond rings

You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're givin' it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye
You don't give nothin' to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on
I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you
You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action

Ooh, I want L.O.D. love on delivery guaranteed
You've got to give a-me L.O.D.
Love on delivery, guaranteed
Ooh, it's got to be

And at the end of a long hard day, baby
What I really need
Is to know there's someone who's waitin'
With love and sympathy

For what is a man all alone
Ain't got a heart and he ain't got a home
But with someone like you
I can come runnin' to, if I got in return, all your

L.O.D. love on delivery, guaranteed

You are to me as sweet as apple pie
You're next to me, we'll reach the highest high
Oh, can't you see it could be ecstasy
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I

Turn down the light, we'll turn 'em way down low
No need to fight, we'll take it nice and slow
Baby, tonight, we gotta let go
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know

Stay the night
You're a woman, I'm a man
Stay the night
We can do what things you planned

Stay the night
Stay the night
Stay the night

We're all alone, there's only you and I
Pull out the phone, we'll kiss the world goodbye
We'll stay at home and make it on our own

Are You Ready
There's rumors of war
Men dying and women crying
If you breathe air, you'll die
Perhaps you wonder the reason why
But wait! Don't you worry
A new day is dawning
We'll catch the sun, and away we'll fly...

Are you ready to sit by His throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then He'll carry you home

(Are you ready?) (2X)

People say that He won't come
And I don't know what say you

follow your heart,
you gotta make your mind up from the start
don't hesitate,
you gotta move before it gets too late

there'll be times,
down the line, when you might go astray
if you find,
peace of mind, don't let it slip away

Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can

OOh you gotta be yourself

(music break 5/4)

reach for the stars,
it doesn't really matter who you are

I said my heart would never break
I could have tried to meet you half way
But now and then we make mistakes
Oh I should have tried to change your mind, begging you to stay

I did all the right things to hurt you
And I stood by watching while you hurt inside
Oh I should have seen it in your eyes
But I didn't realise

Thought that I could take losing you, but I just can't make it
I know that I could win, but being alone just won't do
