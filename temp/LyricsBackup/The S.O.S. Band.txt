Wake up.
Hey, hey, watch for your steps,
There's nowhere safe for you to hide away
‘Cause no one will be there when you’ll fall down.
Hey, hey, clean up that mess,
There's nowhere safe for you to fly away
‘Cause no one will be there to help you.
Free yourself from those chains,
This time there’s nothing left
‘Cause it will be too late.
We're gonna die, we're gonna die.
Awakeness is a non sense
If conscience fades away.
There will be no chance.

No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody
No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody

The kind of love you'll never get enough of
That's what I have for you
So when you need good lovin' you can call on me
And I'll be there to fill your every need

No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody
No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody

And up till now you never really never felt love
At least not like mine, woo, boy
Nobody else could ever love you better
Keep you satisfied, give my love a try

No one's gonna love you the way I do

I'm really please to meet you, girl
And I'd like to get to know you better
Maybe tonight we can get together
For awhile, you and I

I just don't have time
But I'm not turning you down
I can accept your invitation now
'Cause I work all day and sleep all night

I'm a weekend girl
And I don't have time on the weekday
Weekend girl
But maybe we can try to work it out

My offer stands, I think you're worth the wait
And there's only one way to find out
To spend some time is the only way
But it may require some sacrifice

I would like to see you tonight
What's holding you back
My J-O-B is rough on me

You have been single for a long time
And I don't wanna cramp your style
Still you insist you want to settle down
But I know better, you can't change years over night
And asking that, I would never do
So here's the solution that comes to mind

As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you, just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you, just the way you like it

Nobody but you

I don´t want nobody else, it´s you my love

And, you, know, that I am truly hypnotized
By the sparkle in your eyes (your eyes)
I been looking everytime (everytime the time)
Because you upon my mind
And day after day, there are others who come my way
If this heaven aint here, then baby take thy hands
It is mother nature, the greatest gift to us
And you're the only one for me

And I don´t want nobody else (Nobody else)
(Nobody but you) do you know, that it´s true
That for me, and for you
I don´t want nobody else (Nobody else)

Felt like it was heaven sent from above

Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind

My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My love's understanding
Understanding how to hold on to you

After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know (Finest I ever)

If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobody else, uh

Time flies when you're with me
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Make up my mind and I'm positive {A better love}
A better love will never come my way

So when you need good lovin' you can call on me
And I'll be there to fill your every need

No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody
No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody

And up till now you never really never felt love
At least not like mine, woo, boy
Nobody else could ever love you better
Keep you satisfied, give my love a try

No one's gonna love you the way I do

As life goes on
You learn to hold on
You learn to appreciate the finer things in life
The finest

If I had a choice
I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real

My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My love's understanding
Understanding how to hold on to you

After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know (Finest I ever)

If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobody else, uh

Time flies when you're with me
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Make up my mind and I'm positive {A better love}
A better love will never come my way

Soothe you with my caress
Relax, baby, lay your head down on my chest

And soothe you while youre dreaming
A twinkle in your mind
Shimmering thoughts of joy
Sweet dreams, my love
Until youre awake again
Anything to please my man
I like to do the best I can do

I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real

My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My love's understanding
Understanding how to hold on to you

After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know (Finest I ever)

If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobody else, uh

Time flies when you're with me
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Make up my mind and I'm positive {A better love}
A better love will never come my way

Take your time, let's do it

Come on, baby

You know you ought to slow down

Sit back and relax a while

Lay your heavy load down
So we can stop and kick back
It seems we never take the time to do
All the things we want to, yeah

Now, baby we can do it
Take the time, do it right

Wake up.
Hey, hey, watch for your steps,
There's nowhere safe for you to hide away
‘Cause no one will be there when you’ll fall down.
Hey, hey, clean up that mess,
There's nowhere safe for you to fly away
‘Cause no one will be there to help you.
Free yourself from those chains,
This time there’s nothing left
‘Cause it will be too late.
We're gonna die, we're gonna die.
Awakeness is a non sense
If conscience fades away.
There will be no chance.

'Cause I work all day and sleep all night

And I don't have time on the weekday
Weekend girl
But maybe we can try to work it out

My offer stands, I think you're worth the wait
And there's only one way to find out
To spend some time is the only way

I would like to see you tonight

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love.

It's three-o-one in the morning

I feel your presence with me and it doesn't feel right.
And then it starts flowing through me
from my feet right to my head

Then I scream calling out your name

I want you back in my bed
my bed.

You have been single for a long time
And I don't wanna cramp your style
Still you insist you want to settle down
But I know better, you can't change years over night
And asking that, I would never do
So here's the solution that comes to mind

As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you, just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you, just the way you like it

Friends tell me I am crazy
And I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
It's not the way I see it
‘Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

People always talkin' ‘bout
Your reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

Friends are always tellin' me
You're a user
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

You may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine

You never do them to me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

You have been single for a long time
And I don't wanna cramp your style
Still you insist you want to settle down
But I know better, you can't change years over night
And asking that, I would never do
So here's the solution that comes to mind

As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you, just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you, just the way you like it

Anything to please my man

But I know better, you can't change years over night
And asking that, I would never do
So here's the solution that comes to mind

As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you, just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you, just the way you like it

No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody
No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody

The kind of love you'll never get enough of
That's what I have for you
So when you need good lovin' you can call on me
And I'll be there to fill your every need

No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody
No one's gonna love you the way I do
Nobody

And up till now you never really never felt love
At least not like mine, woo, boy
Nobody else could ever love you better
Keep you satisfied, give my love a try

No one's gonna love you the way I do

As life goes on
You learn to hold on
You learn to appreciate the finer things in life
The finest

If I had a choice
I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real

My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My love's understanding
Understanding how to hold on to you

After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know (Finest I ever)

If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobody else, uh

Time flies when you're with me
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Make up my mind and I'm positive {A better love}
A better love will never come my way

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love.

It's three-o-one in the morning
another sleepless night

I feel your presence with me and it doesn't feel right.
And then it starts flowing through me
from my feet right to my head

Then I scream calling out your name

I want you back in my bed
my bed.

Soothe you with my caress
Relax, baby, lay your head down on my chest
Im not a doctor, but
Ill cure all your troubles
Even when you sleep
Youll know that I am there
To hug and keep you warm
And soothe you while youre dreaming
A twinkle in your mind
Shimmering thoughts of joy
Sweet dreams, my love
Until youre awake again
Anything to please my man
I like to do the best I can do
My all, Ill give to you
Cause you are my love and you are my life

Felt like it was heaven sent from above
