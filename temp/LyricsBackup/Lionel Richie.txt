I've been alone with you inside my head
And in my dreams
I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

Hello
Is it me you're looking for
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile

You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do

Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
(We were running, running with the night)

You were looking so good girl, heads were turning
You and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were burning

There was a lonely man
A man with no direction, with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for, for me

You made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl

Got a busy day, everyday but not today

So you can just chill and clear your head
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it
Prepare your meal and make your bed
Willing to switch places with you

Drop everything and just go go go

And still have to ask the same question
Why?

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
When you and me would kiss at night
Remember what we tripped like
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
Now it's so hard to find two words to say

Funny me, funny you
Don't have nothing lft in common
You wanted me to have your heart
Now you want it back
What about the promise you made to me
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason
And suddenly we're flying high
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast
You're trying to get lost
I'm trying to pull up
And damn I can't say
You said you didn't need me
I really didn't think that you would leave me

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
When you and me would kiss at night
Remember what we tripped like
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night

I'm leaving in an hour and you won't be up in time to say goodbye
And whoa, I'm putting this on tape

Baby, you're wonderful, I really mean it, babe
More than you will ever know
Wish that I could stay but I gotta go
I'll be back but in the meantime keep in mind

That you are something too big for words
And it's my pleasure to love you for better or worse
'Cause what you are, a beautiful mother to your kids
Sometimes this slips my mind so in case I forget

Girl, you are, you are better than anything I ever had
You are the perfect love, never give you up

Wanna keep me up all night
She told me,? Don't be so uptight?
She wanna keep me up all night
Damn, she might kill me

I found me a pretty little thing
Wanna keep me up all night
She says, she gonna make things all right
She wanna keep me up all night
Damn, she might kill me

I'm in Brazil, where the scene is so fire
Where the girls and trees can get hotter
Everything that I see, it talks to me
Can't believe how the girls be walking

I've been here about an hour they keep saying,? Come talk to me?
I keep thinking there's one and they say us three
Standing there getting out of the shower
Turning around showing me the thing got power

Started to converse and I sense a problem
And I'm thinking girl, I can always solve them
But she didn't want to hear it
She says, she is all mine and I can make him feel it

All along I was thinking it was gonna be her plus two
Now they're looking like Lionel the joke's on you
Next thing I'm feeling is her up and down
While the girls are watching

So I found me a little thing
Wanna keep me up all night

But when you're young
All you know how to do is wrong
Life can play tricks sometimes, you know
You think you got everything
When you got nothing at all
The only way you know where you're going
You gotta take a fall, you've got to lose it all

(I'm coming home)
I've been through some pain i know
(I'm coming home)
Changes in my life

Now I know what's meaningful

I'm trying to figure out the world around me
It seems we make the same mistakes over again
An I can't understand why
Tell me about it

Why do we walk in the footsteps of our ancestors
In a monotonous fashion
Recreating the same failures and crimes of passion
Help me understand our fascination with bloodshed and violence
What happened to the notion of the evil days being behind us
Are we too lost to find salvation or could it be
We don't want salvation to find us
Are we content with the changes that bind us

(Chorus)
We go on and on
To the rhythm
On and on
To the rhythm
We go on and on
To the rhythm
On and on

There's something else on my mind

Ain't it strange when we make change
We end up with dollars and no sense
Progress is a false pretense
From and Cain & Abel to any ghetto
Tiannemen Square to Soweto, apartheid to Jim Crowe
Are these problems incurable
We can charge stars invisible to the eye

Are you sad
Or just a little lonely
I can see something
Deep in your eyes
Do you walk away
Or do you come closer
Are you looking for romance
Or just a surprise

(Stay for the night)
For the night
(Baby won't you play with me)
Won't you play with me

Don't wanna play no games
Don't wanna put you through changes
All I wanna know is girl

You are that gentle breeze on a summer's day

I can see peace inside your fire

Oh, now I can't even think what my life would be
To be without you even one day

Chorus:
You're the closest thing to heaven in my world
Never take this heaven from my arms
Don't take your love from me or you'll take everything
You're the closest thing to heaven that I've ever seen
You are, you are the closest thing to heaven

Tryin' to play me like a fool

How could you look at my face

Ah you know I've been through so many changes in my life girl
Aw I've been up real high where I thought I didn't need anybody
Aw and then again I've been down real low where
There was no one in my life who needed me
Aw and I found that material things I, I thought had so much value
Aw girl didn't really have any value at all

That I was a lonely man
A man with no direction, with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for, for me
Aw girl then you, then you came into my life
You made my jagged edges smooth
You made my, you made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl

You see you're my heart, you're soul
You're my stone inspiration, baby
Oh that's why I'm standin' here singin'
And opening my arms to you
I want to say child why don't ya

Show me a river that's so deep
Show me a mountain so high
I'll show you love that'll last forever
Flyin' high, so high

Show me a place where dreams are for dreamers
And all the things you wish come true, yeah
I'd wish the world had all happy people
Then there'd be no more wishing to do

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet, sweet love

Sun shines over the rainbow
High on a hill
Take a ride on a magic carpet
And you know it's for real

The world is filled with all the lonely people
Tryin' to find their way
All they need is a hand to guide them
To a brighter day

Временами я думаю о нас,
Утыкаю себя временами.
Мое сердце бьется раз в час.
Я очень болен другими словами.

Она на полупальцах в тишину.
Я за ней, но менее резво.
Я удивляюсь тому, что дышу
Одним воздухом с ней и остаюсь трезвым.

Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можно знать.
Ты знаешь обо мне все, что можешь знать только ты.
Ты знаешь, я смогу все заново начать только с тобой.

Just remember love will find a way

I see the tears you cry
I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care
But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way
Are you trying to find a beginning?
Something just to hold on to
Always know that love will find a way
Is it hard this life you're living
Does the world seem so unkind
Don't you worry love will find a way
Some say we've lost our way
Some say the world has gone astray
But if you know where you're going
There's nothing you can't do
'Cause problems will come and they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul

Tell me are you going through changes
Time seems like it's passing by
Just believe that love will find a way
I see the tears you cry
I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care
But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way
Are you trying to find a beginning?
Something just to hold on to
Always know that love will find a way
Is it hard this life you're living
Does the world seem so unkind
Don't you worry love will find a way
Some say we've lost our way
Some say the world has gone astray
But if you know where you're going
There's nothing you can't do
'Cause problems will come and they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul
...

Let me tell you now all that's on my mind
For a love like yours is oh so very hard to find
Looked inside myself now I'm very sure
There can only be you for me
I need you more and more...

You turned me inside out
And you showed me what life was about
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away
I wanna do all I can just to show you
Make you understand
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away

When you're in my arms
When I'm close to you
There's a magic in your touch that just comes shining through
Want you everyday

Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
'Til the morning light

Oh

You were looking so good girl
Heads were turning
You and me on the town
Ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us

You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much

When my whole life was lonely

Angel in disguise

just hypnotize
I just love the magic of your spell
How much joy we have together
Only time will tell!

And in my dreams
I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much

I can feel my resistance falling so low
Don't you know baby you got it
This hold on me
But I love just what you're doing
Oh you're all I need

When I'm dancing with you girl
With the lights down low
The power you possess
You know I can't let go
Oh listen to me
Don't stop moving, baby
Tonight's the night
Don't stop moving baby
It'll be alright

I guess I need to say I'm sorry
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you
I only wanted just to love you
But now that were through I can't get over you.

I didn't mean to write a love song
I didn't mean to share these feeling I have in my heart
I told myself I could forget you
Now I know that's not true, I can't get over you.

And as I walk down through the halls
I see your pictures hanging on the walls, those memories
For all the thing that we've been through
...

Your love was just a game

Do I love you?
Let me tell ya,
My mona lisa with a smile,
Knowing all that we've been through,

We've lasted for a while.

But life can be that way,
You made all the mountains,
Seem so small.
'cause when there's love,
True love,
Nothing else matters,
At all.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
How will I know if someone loves me
How will I know if there is no one else
Dying to have someone who loves me
But I want them to love me for myself
Looked for love in all the wrong places
I searched the moon and stars
Found myself lost in a world full of faces
The place I didn't look was my heart

I've been all around the world try to find something new,
Lord knows that something was you
'Cause I found in myself the one thing that is true
All I want is an ordinary girl
All I need is an ordinary girl

Chorus: Ordinary (2x)

All I want is someone I can talk to
Someone I can lean on now and then
And I don't wanna lie, pretend I am someone else
I am just looking for a friend
My heart was going through so many changes,
I didn't know which way to turn
...

Say I do I do I do

That your love was all I needed to complete my life
Will you make this sacrifice
It's hard to believe
But your love has turned my around
I can make a commitment now

(Chorus)
Say I do I do I do
If you really love me
Say I do I do I do

Let me tell you this
Your love I can't resist
I just start to fantasize

I want to laugh and talk
And say the words you long to hear

The real world will just disappear

Chorus: let me take you to a place I call paradise
Hold you in my arms every day and night
Tell you all the things that I really feel
Show you that my love is for real
Let me take you to paradise

You know it's taken me a long time, baby, to realize
How much you mean to me, I don't wanna lose you

Times are hard, my spirits are weak, oh yeah
Everything seems to be going wrong, outlook's bleak
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real

No, I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight

I'm gonna hold on to the love we have together
Hold on, don't you say goodbye
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl, I don't wanna lose you

Girl, I've got to have your sweet loving
'Cause without it, girl, I'll just lose my mind

Love can have its mysteries
Some strange, enchanted notion
You can't explain just how it begins
A feel, a smile, a potion
But something goes off in your head
You can't believe the words you just said
It's not so hard to see the light
Lovers at first sight

When the right one comes along
There is no hesitation
You wonder how you lost all control
It's just a revelation
And that's the way I felt with you
One glance was all it took and I knew
...

Climbing to the top
I'll tell you anything you want
We're on this planetary journey to a place beyond
The independent minds will tell you
The colors you should wear
But know the game of life
Is just a game of solitaire

Climbing to the top
The ones you love will come and go
When you lose you sacrifice
Chasing the rainbow
And if you should climb this magic ladder
The story will unfold
Just remember when you reach the top
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
You held my hand and then you slipped away
And I may never see your face again
So tell me how to fill this emptiness inside
Without love, what is life?

And anyone who knew us both can see
We always were the better part of me
Never wanted to be this free
And all this pain, when does it go away?

Then every time I turn around
And you're nowhere to be found, I know

I got a long long way to go
Before I can say goodbye to you
Oh, I gotta long long way I know
...

I still believe
In you and me, oh
Still believe the sun
Will shine on me

I still believe there's a reason
There's a meaning to why we're here
There is a place where we can go to
Where we don't have to live in fear

They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean
And I'm just dreaming my life away, oh

But I still believe
In you and me
Still believe the sun
Will shine on me
I still believe
True love is the answer and
Don't turn away
'Cos I'm believe in love, that's the only way

I'm believe in every moment
Every heartbeat that we're here
And we're a part of each other

Golden days, life was play
Pain was all a world away
We went to school, we learned the rules
We trusted all they had to say
Then life took a turn
We all had to learn
And we can't go back again

And my heart is breaking
Just for you, just for you
And my arms are open
Just for you, just for you
Just for you

God was god and dreams were dreams
Life was all cake and ice cream
Truth was true and lies were lies
We thought love would never die

It's been this many years
It's been that many years
And still have to ask the same question
Why?

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
When you and me would kiss at night
Remember what we tripped like
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
Now it's so hard to find two words to say

Funny me, funny you
Don't have nothing lft in common
You wanted me to have your heart
Now you want it back
What about the promise you made to me
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason
And suddenly we're flying high
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast
You're trying to get lost
I'm trying to pull up
And damn I can't say
You said you didn't need me
I really didn't think that you would leave me

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
When you and me would kiss at night
Remember what we tripped like
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
Now it's so hard to find two words to say

Ballerina Girl
You are so lovely
With you standing there
I'm so aware
Of how much I care for you

You are more than now
You are for always
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away

You make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you

Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
And ever and ever and ever and ever, forever girl

Don't know why we had an argument
All I know is that my baby left
Now I'm looking at a photograph
Thinking all about the time we spent

And I can't even begin to start
You're not here, it tears me apart
But you gotta know that I need you
Girl I'm lost and don't know where to go to
I need you baby

Girl I'm missing you, need you in my life
'Cause I thought we'd be in love for a long time
Even if you're gone you'll be on my mind
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
And ever and ever and ever and ever, forever girl

It’d be so nice (nice nice)
If you didn’t have to feel so lonely
It’d be so nice (nice nice)
If I could sneak you for a moment

I know you like to get away, go away, far away
To a place where there’s just us two
Got a busy day, everyday but not today
Cause I’m here to take that stress from you

So you can just chill and clear your head
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it
Prepare your meal and make your bed
Willing to switch places with you
cause you are so worth it

I just want us to go go go
Drop everything and just go go go
I just want us to go go go
Drop everything and just go go go

So I'm here in this place by myself, all you had to do was try

If you could see it through my eyes
It would explain the tears I've cried
Why did you walk out of my life?
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me?

You'd know the reason why I tried
So hard to never let love die

All she wanna be is part of my plan
Safe to say that I'm in a better way, a better way, hey

Here we stand all God's children together, we're trying to see where we belong.
With hills and valleys to conquer, it's time we whether the storm.
Everybody's looking for something, something they can hold onto.

But she drives me crazy
I don't know what she does
But she drives me wild
If only she could let me be
The man I wanna be
Well she can leave me
Helpless as a child

I don't know how it is
But she has the power
She can make me laugh
When I wanna cry, oh yeah
She tells me that I'm in control
But I know it's just a lie
And I don't mind, oh

Will she love you tomorrow?

Oh well ah baby aw

Aw and then again I've been down real low where
There was no one in my life who needed me
Aw and I found that material things I thought had so much value
Aw girl didn't really have any value at all

There was a lonely man
A man with no direction, with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for, for me
Aw girl then you, then you came into my life
You made my jagged edges smooth
You made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl

You see you're my heart, you're soul

You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely

Angel in disguise
with your power of love
just hypnotize
I just love the magic of your spell
How much joy we have together
Only time will tell!

Stuck on you
Got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way

Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you til' the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Are you feeling down and lonely?
Feeling like you can't go on
Just remember love will find a way
Tell me are you going through changes
Time seems like it's passing by
Just believe that love will find a way
I see the tears you cry
I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care
But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way
Are you trying to find a beginning?
Something just to hold on to
Always know that love will find a way
Is it hard this life you're living
Does the world seem so unkind
Don't you worry love will find a way
Some say we've lost our way
Some say the world has gone astray
But if you know where you're going
There's nothing you can't do
'Cause problems will come and they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul
...

Let me tell you now all that's on my mind
For a love like yours is oh so very hard to find
Looked inside myself now I'm very sure
There can only be you for me
I need you more and more...

You turned me inside out
And you showed me what life was about
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away
I wanna do all I can just to show you
Make you understand
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away

When you're in my arms
When I'm close to you
There's a magic in your touch that just comes shining through
Want you everyday

Are you feeling down and lonely?
Feeling like you can't go on
Just remember love will find a way
Tell me are you going through changes
Time seems like it's passing by
Just believe that love will find a way
I see the tears you cry
I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care
But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way
Are you trying to find a beginning?
Something just to hold on to
Always know that love will find a way
Is it hard this life you're living
Does the world seem so unkind
Don't you worry love will find a way
Some say we've lost our way
Some say the world has gone astray
But if you know where you're going
There's nothing you can't do
'Cause problems will come and they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul

Sometimes we learn 'bout being a fool

The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
'Til the morning light
(we were running)
Oh

You were looking so good girl
Heads were turning
You and me on the town
Ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us

Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball

There was no one in my life who needed me
Aw and I found that material things I thought had so much value
Aw girl didn't really have any value at all

There was a lonely man
A man with no direction, with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for, for me
Aw girl then you, then you came into my life
You made my jagged edges smooth
You made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl

You see you're my heart, you're soul

Thanks for the time that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you

You came in
That's what my little heart was looking for
laughter in the rain
feeling like a fool in love again
Oh, the laughter came
when the tears stopped falling
now all I do is just call your name
you walked in and my heart discovered
that my life would never be the same

I know
you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely

Angel in disguise
with your power of love
just hypnotize
I just love the magic of your spell
How much joy we have together
Only time will tell!

Oh, the laughter came
when the tears stopped falling
Now all I do is just call your name
(I just call your name)
You walked in and my heart discovered
That my life would never be the same!

I know, you are my destiny

All my love with you
No one else will do...

And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts,
Two hearts that beat as one

You know it's taken me a long time, baby, to realize
How much you mean to me, I don't wanna lose you

Times are hard, my spirits are weak, oh yeah
Everything seems to be going wrong, outlook's bleak
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real

No, I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight

I'm gonna hold on to the love we have together
Hold on, don't you say goodbye
Tell me now before we lose forever

Golden days, life was play
Pain was all a world away
We went to school, we learned the rules
We trusted all they had to say
Then life took a turn
We all had to learn
And we can't go back again

And my heart is breaking
Just for you, just for you
And my arms are open

We thought love would never die

They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean
And I'm just dreaming my life away, oh

But I still believe
In you and me
Still believe the sun
Will shine on me
I still believe
True love is the answer and
Don't turn away
'Cos I'm believe in love, that's the only way

Every heartbeat that we're here
And we're a part of each other

Where angels go
And we found a place inside us
That only we could know

So I still walk on
Through the night and through the rain
I would give it all

Do ya know she's tryin' to fool ya
I know what she's doin' to ya, She loves me more than you

It's been this many years
It's been that many years
And still have to ask the same question
Why?

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
When you and me would kiss at night
Remember what we tripped like
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
Now it's so hard to find two words to say

Funny me, funny you
Don't have nothing lft in common
You wanted me to have your heart
Now you want it back
What about the promise you made to me
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason
And suddenly we're flying high
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast
You're trying to get lost
I'm trying to pull up
And damn I can't say
You said you didn't need me
I really didn't think that you would leave me

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
When you and me would kiss at night
Remember what we tripped like
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
Now it's so hard to find two words to say

Just remember love will find a way
Tell me are you going through changes

I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care
But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way
Are you trying to find a beginning?
Something just to hold on to
Always know that love will find a way
Is it hard this life you're living
Does the world seem so unkind
Don't you worry love will find a way
Some say we've lost our way
Some say the world has gone astray
But if you know where you're going
There's nothing you can't do
'Cause problems will come and they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul

You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely

Angel in disguise
with your power of love
just hypnotize
I just love the magic of your spell
How much joy we have together
Only time will tell!

Something fresh, something wild, take it up like a shooting star
Cause I never found anyone like you
And you are the beat in my heart

Don't stop the music

Take a trip to the stars, make a wish, rocket to the moon
There you are between Venus and Mars, now you're in the groove

To a new world that is now so near,

From the bottom to the top,
To the leaders of the land,
We all have one heart,
Everyone of us must lend a hand,

And let there be joy in the world,
Let there be,
And let there be no sorrow,
Let there be,
And let there be peace on earth,
Let there be,
For all the world we've got to see the love,
Oh love, what a blessed thing,

maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
with my tender heart.

My love.
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright
My first love.

You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I, aaa.

I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

They tell me how much you care
Oh yes... you will always be

Golden days, life was play, pain was all a world away
We went to school, we learned the rules
We trusted all they all had to say
Then life took a turn, we all had to learn
And we can't go back again

And my heart is breaking just for you, just for you
And my arms are open just for you, just for you, just for you

God was God, dreams were dreams
Life was all cake and ice cream
Truth was true, and lies were lies
...

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
...

Know it sounds funny
But I just can't stand the pain
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl
You know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole
And I borrowed
Ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning
Why in the world

I just want to tell you, all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me

You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight

Everybody's talking loud
Tryin' to get me to join the crowd
But I can't hear what they're talking about
Cause they ain't sayin' nothin'
They say come follow me
What I'm telling you will set you free
All you gotta do is act like me
But I can't feel nothin'

I just want somebody
To laugh out loud
I just want somebody
To make me smile

Whoah I'm
I'm trying to finda reason to believe [x2]

(Dont Tell Me I have to start all over again)
I Never thought this day would come
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)
I realize that you're the one
(and you're telling me it's time to say goodbye)
What's inside of my heart It ain't gonna change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
(You feel it I feel it Let's not pretend let's not pretend)

Maybe I Don't Know What Love Is
Maybe I'm A Fool
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You

Something's going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the lights
We're gonna have a party

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people startin' a climb the walls
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling

I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times

You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say, and you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much, I love you

With the lights down low

Tonight's the night
Don't stop moving baby
