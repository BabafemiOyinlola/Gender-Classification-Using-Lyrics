She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

I feel so lost, don't know why this has happened to me
My closest friend, I never would have thought it could be
You were someone, someone I really thought I could trust
But my man you laid and I'm betrayed

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

My baby took me to a special place
Said he had a surprise for me
He told me to close my eyes
So that I could not see
And when I opened them up
He was on one knee reachin' for my hand
(That's when)

He proposed to me
He proposed with a diamond ring
I started crying
He placed it on my finger
And I said, "Yes"
He proposed to me
My baby proposed with a diamond ring
I couldn't believe it
I looked in his eyes
And I said, "Yes"

I'll never forget that night
It was 8: 43pm to be precise

I had a problem and I went the wrong way
I came to the altar and I asked you to pray
Instead you talked about me, said I wouldn't be blessed
I couldn't believe it, mmm, thought in church I'd find rest

So heed my warning 'cause the Bible it surely says
You can't judge me for God's judgment will come your way
You may not believe in me but my God has the final say
See God will take care of me but He's going to take care of you
Be careful of what you say and what you do

My marriage was messed up, I was broken inside
I had to keep smiling 'cause You were watching my eyes
I talked to the Lord, said I love You but I'm through
But He wouldn't let me go, no, no, no, said I got work to do
Please heed

Heed my warning
(Tell them what the Bible says)
'Cause the bible it surely says

Can i share my story
About my journey
Ups and downs i've had plenty
Looking for love in al the wrong places
But i found nothing to fill my empty spaces

I looked for mother she wasn't there
No father around to care
Sisters and brothers were not around
And my friends no where to be found

But when i called jesus
He was right there
To hear my cry
And answer my prayer
The lord is so faithful
He's been better to me
Then i been to myself

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

I feel so lost, don't know why this has happened to me
My closest friend, I never would have thought it could be
You were someone, someone I really thought I could trust
But my man you laid and I'm betrayed

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

Hit it and run, real affection
Whatever it is I won't let you waste my time
So how will I know

Baby with just a kiss, boy when you touch my lips
Honey, I'll know for sure, boy when my eyes meet yours
And if your love is true, I'll give to you my very best
Just pass the test

This song is dedicated to all the brothers out there
Who've ever loved a woman whether it was your mother
Whether it was a lover or whether it was your daughter
In every woman lies a soul and in the soul of every woman
Lies the secrets of love and sometimes you don't do right by her
But the way back to her heart lives in that same soul
You just have to find it

So pure, there through thick and thin
No shame in showing, she is your best friend
So strong and though you've let her down
You won't see her frown but make it right and look inside

You will find, she was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless she cries but you never cherished her
You took for granted love

You sigh, remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside, she was the only one
Who'd love you forever more

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
You are my destiny

It's been a long time since we started
And all of the hurting we've been through
I find that I'm still in love with you
Searchin' and searchin', looking for better
Greener pastures never grew
'Cause everything I needed I already had with you

Been around and tried to find someone
To replace the love that made us one
No one else could ever make me whole
You for me and only me for you
Come to me and we can start things new
Heaven knows the way that I miss you
Baby please don't take your love from me
Only you can make my life complete

I've learned a lesson
Never to let the one you love slip away
Oh baby, it took this tragedy
For me to see that you are the only one
Baby you complete me
...

Baby, I've been watching from a distance
And everything it rings familiarly, mmm
But I can't imagine what you must be thinkin'
'Cuz she can never be what I can be

Oh, loneliness has really got you twisted
And there's so much your eyes don't even see, yeah
And then I laid my eyes upon your woman
And to my surprise I saw me lookin' at me
But how could you be with her?

Her
You don't really love her, no
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I won't stand by and watch you pretend
So baby how could you?

Her
You don't really love her, no

We parted so that we could make it better

But when you smile, they say, girl, just keep it
Desperate for change
But things never change

So I'd rather stand in the rain
Though it's pouring down on me
It's washing all my pain away

Oh, I'd rather stand in the rain

But it's washing all my pain
Washing all my pain away

At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to me
If you love me, you would've done those things

You won't miss me till I'm gone
Impossible to drink from a well that's gone dry, yeah
And every night you come in singing the same old song
How could you do me wrong?
When you know it ain't right

For this miracle performed
That through me would come a baby
Who would one day be my Lord

But right now He's just a baby
And the world is not so sure
'Cause while some bow down to worship
There are some who laugh and scorn

But there's a will and there's a purpose
That I know He must fulfill
And the reason why you chose me
Very soon will be revealed

But for now can I just hold Him
And keep Him in my arms
And for now can I just hold Him
And keep Him safe from harm
And I'll give Him back to you, oh yes I will
