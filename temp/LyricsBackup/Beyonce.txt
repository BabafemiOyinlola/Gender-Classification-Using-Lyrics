Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
All of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
And you find the perfect match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self

I'm good on any MLK Boulevard

See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X

But you still cant find happiness
Cuz when you feel like you're forsaken life can be so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home
So your life can be planned

Hey yo, B
This a good look right here, yeah
Bad Boy, baby, uh
Hey yo, B

I've been wanting to explain to you what it is that you do to me
Got me open, I am so in love with loving you
Touching places, no one else has ever made me feel incredible
When you touch me, I feel sexy, no one else like you

Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me

Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me

Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever! in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever! in the morning
Fever all through the night

On A star

And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes.
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done

Do you think you could fall for a woman like me?
'Cause I find it hard to trust, I need too much,
And I really don't believe in love, no, no...

Do you think that I could be the girl of your dreams?
Sometimes I don't let things go, get emotional,
And sometimes, I'm just out of control...

You need to stop for a minute,
Before you get too deep up in it... (Too deep...)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems;
It's hard lovin' a woman, a woman like me... (Woman like me...)
You need to think about it,
Before you get hooked on the venom, and can't live without it... (No, no, no!)
Can't believe everything you see;
It's hard lovin' a woman, a woman like me...

I remember when you use to take me on a
Bike ride everyday on the Bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
(I was so excited)
I was so happy to see you (so happy to see you)

Because you loved me I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy

This is just another day that I would spend
Waitin' for the right one.

To feel the warm sun.
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake
I'm in Heaven, for heaven sakes
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now

You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever-complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you

Smash into you

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feeling lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships

The shoes on my feet
I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I've bought it
The rock I'm rocking'
'Cause I depend on me
If I wanted the watch you're wearing'
I'll buy it
The house I live in

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)

Somebody pinch me

With just my family by my side

And they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American

And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind

And it's my name that's on that Jag
So go move your bags
Let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me to say:

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

So go ahead and get gone

Tutte le donne single Ora, Put your hands up
Fino nel club, abbiamo appena rotto
Io sto facendo la mia piccola cosa
Ha deciso di tuffo, ma ora si desidera viaggio
Cuz un altro fratello √® accorto di me
Sono su di lui, sei su di me

Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me

I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh

She don't gotta give it up, she professional

She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy (oh no)
She already made enough but she'll never leave

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business

Oh, my daddy said shoot

And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?

Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

Singin', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!

Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

You was on the remix like...
In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love up in you
One time if you ain't scared say wassup
In this club
In this club
They can keep watching I ain't stopping
Baby I don't give up

Ladies can I put this love up in you
One time if you ain't scared say wassup

It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
...

If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you

I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize

The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strain
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch with it to
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addiction, I caint lie

Kiss me one more time before I die

You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive

Cause he‚Äôs taken you for granted

Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly

And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I looove you
And that's why I looooooove (hmm)

Good morning, Angels
Good Morning, Charlie
Question...
Lucy Liu... with my girl, Drew... Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, Come on

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships

The shoes on my feet (I've bought it)
The clothes I'm wearing (I've bought it)
The rock I'm rockin'
'Cause I depend on me
If I wanted the watch you're wearin' (I'll buy it)
The house I live in (I've bought it)
The car I'm driving (I've bought it)
I depend on me (I depend on me)

All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

But it was game you had me fooled
Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already had my mailbox full

Where you been baby
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key

As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

Going outta my head I think Im loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
Youve got me!

And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?

cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do

En su trampa una vez mas

Ay, no nos pelearemos
Ay, no nos va a enga√±ar
Ay, no terminaremos
Por un bello embustero

No, nos va dividir?
No, no nos va a exitar
No, vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

He kissed me, he's a one and only beautiful liar

Ha deciso di tuffo, ma ora si desidera viaggio
Cuz un altro fratello √® accorto di me
Sono su di lui, sei su di me
Non pagare gli eventuali attenzione
pianto le mie lacrime, a tre anni buoni
Ya non pu√≤ essere arrabbiato con me

Cuz se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso
Se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso
Non essere pazzo, una volta si vede che lui vuole
Se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso

Hello baby, how you doing?
You know Ima cut right to the chase huh
Some women, were made
But me, myself?!
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know, hm
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on, baby let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gon', need it,
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets,
You didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big, (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong, (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much, (much)
It's too tough (tough)

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo

If I were a boy
even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the earth

And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you

Ears closed
What I hear no one else has to know
Cause' I know

Turn the lights on!

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air, cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl

I'm in this fight and I'm swinging and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can't barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I try to be patient but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wondering why...
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I...
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love... that could be us..."

Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold

I be on the hotline, like err'day
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound

The only one that papa allowed to hang out in my room with the door closed
We'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom--'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out on my window another moonlight
And he, be keepin' me close so I never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

So press record, I'll let you film me

Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

I love how you approach me
Fresh white with your pants hangin' grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore

Swag up, it's bright, one blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby you doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here

You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone

I got a big, (eheheh), Ego
She love my big, (eheheh), Ego

I like to joke around a little bit but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world
Of gold-plated Earl, cause
Everything I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl
She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me,"
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
That's good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe

If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you

I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize

Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
But who's gonna be mine?

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?

Would it change the sky tonight
Would it give me some light

Are you drifting by?

I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you

You're nearly here
And then you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear

Io sto facendo la mia piccola cosa
Ha deciso di tuffo, ma ora si desidera viaggio
Cuz un altro fratello √® accorto di me
Sono su di lui, sei su di me
Non pagare gli eventuali attenzione

Ya non pu√≤ essere arrabbiato con me

Now put your hands up

Up in the club, we just broke up
I¬¥m doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me

I¬¥m up on him, he up on me
Don¬¥t pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
You can¬¥t be mad at me
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Don¬¥t be mad once you see that he want it

Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you, yes
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true, yes
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feeling good, yes
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood, yes

Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe, yes
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart, yes
Wanna show you show you show you till you through with me
I wanna keep it how it is but you can never say how it used to be!

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
Swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Baby let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down!

You'll never need two cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
Cause I can recognize that you know that

So press record, I'll let you film me

Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone
I love how you approach me
Fresh white with your pants hangin' grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swag up, it's bright, one blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby you doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here
You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone

You're bad for me I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strain
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch with it to
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addiction, I caint lie

Kiss me one more time before I die

You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive

You are my raindrop

With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
Cause years before I became who I am
Baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful
To have you by my side

My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes

Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine
Oh, mine, oh, mine, oh, mine
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since then, baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh

'Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far
With me being where ever I'm at
Worrying about where ever you are
We're taking this a little too far

On my mind, I pass my bed time
No rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this
And let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now you know where I stay

I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard you're mine, you're mine

MTV, welcome to my world

Pretty hurts
What's your aspiration in life?
To be happy

It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

t's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

You want me?
I want it done my way
You like it?
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

Ride around, ride around in that action
Those candles in your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

Baby, put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

'Cause you're no angel either, baby

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no, no, no"

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you keep me your promise, I'm keeping mine, hey

Must be good to you

(Keep me coming, keep me going)
Keep me coming, keep me going
(Keep me humming, keep me moaning)
Keep me humming, keep me moaning

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So go move your bags
Let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me to say:
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone

And the way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along

Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart

If I were a boy
even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

I'm in this fight and I'm swinging and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can't barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I try to be patient but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe

I wish I could believe you
Then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied

And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I can't go on and pretend like

I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me

I don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing no
Everything you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you

And though you break my heart
You're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't want to play that part

I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

They like the way I'm walkin'

Tutte le donne single Ora, Put your hands up
Fino nel club, abbiamo appena rotto
Io sto facendo la mia piccola cosa
Ha deciso di tuffo, ma ora si desidera viaggio
Cuz un altro fratello √® accorto di me
Sono su di lui, sei su di me
Non pagare gli eventuali attenzione
pianto le mie lacrime, a tre anni buoni
Ya non pu√≤ essere arrabbiato con me

Cuz se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso
Se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso
Non essere pazzo, una volta si vede che lui vuole
Se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso

Uh ohohohohohohoh

Se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso

Se ti √® piaciuto, allora si dovrebbe avere messo un anello su di esso

Ho messo gloss sulle labbra, un uomo sui fianchi

Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me

I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it

Solo por una vez
Yo me vestir√≠a como quiero, con lo que vea primero
Y me voy

Saldr√≠a a buscar chicas por mont√≥n
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompa√±arme hasta el fin
Cada noche a vivir

Si yo fuera un chico
S√© que podr√≠a saber
Comprender mucho mejor lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabr√≠a escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber qu√© pas√≥

Told you give the drummer some, now the drummer cummin'

Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' stripper to a super C.E.O
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do
I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary
I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl, ooooh
That's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl, we just messed up a brand new couch, girl
You ain't on site then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo

So tell me how is that

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna to take breath without you babe
I don't wanna to play that part

I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart

With hopes that maybe I‚Äôll get a chance to see you

Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You‚Äôre the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don‚Äôt want to wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain‚Äôt going no where
Baby long as you‚Äôre here
I‚Äôll be floating on air cause you‚Äôre my

Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear

And I‚Äôm rich I could buy you
Kill bitches leave your body in a bayou
More brain than an IQ
More head than a drug, buy yours
And my bank account ain‚Äôt hardly empty
That‚Äôs why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mama Cita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry

Just raised the gas prices

Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
That's good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe

May God bless and keep you always,
May your wishes all come true,
May you always do for others
And let others do for you.
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.
May you grow up to be righteous,
May you grow up to be true,
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you.
May you always be courageous,
Stand upright and be strong,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.
May your hands always be busy,
May your feet always be swift,
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful,
May your song always be sung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me

Oh, if I were a boy

When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

You acting so ungratefully

The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)

You was on the wall, I was with my crew
You was watching me, baby, I was watching you
Slowly you walked over, I maintained my cool
You said hello to me, I said hello to you

You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me, I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you

I said yes to your number

In December every sign has it‚Äôs own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine

I was in love with a Sagittarius he blew my mind
He also had a flip side too much like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus the way he handled me yeah
Flirtatious like and Aries
Which sign is best for me?

Capricorn Aquarius Pisces Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer oh!
Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius
I love all y‚Äôall
Capricorn Aquarius Pisces Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer oh!
Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius
I love all y‚Äôall

I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, cause I‚Äôve been hurt by a Pisces
Rewind

You've got me
You've got me
You've got me
You've got me speechless

Where you been baby
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

Only time we don't speak is durin' "Sex and the City"

She's right back to being my souljah
Cuz mami's a rida, and I'm a rolla

When I'm off track mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

Steady wasting time with Hill and
I need to live my life
Because my time is unforgiving

Blue skies are turning grey
And that's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards
You might start
Returning to your vision

I be on the hotline, like err'day
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound

The only one that papa allowed to hang out in my room with the door closed
We'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom--'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out on my window another moonlight
And he, be keepin' me close so I never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

Hello baby, how you doing?
You know Ima cut right to the chase huh
Some women, were made
But me, myself?!
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know, hm
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on, baby let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gon', need it,
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets,
You didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big, (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong, (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much, (much)
It's too tough (tough)

Oh!

I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stops
Cause they know you know just what to say
And the way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

You had me at hello
Hello

You had me at hello
Hello

Baby when you

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time? And
It's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone

Turn the lights on!

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air, cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Better say my name
Remember the other day
I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh huh", "Yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there
First of all, let me say

I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me
I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?
I know you say that I am assuming things
Somethings going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
Nobody's holding you back from me

Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're saying everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell me the truth
If somebody's there, then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say baby I love you

If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name

A melody I start but can't complete

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't

And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind

"Oh, my aspiration in life would be... to be happy"

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl"
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts

Man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge,
I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit

And I'm crashing into you
Baby kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out

I remember being young and so brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run news

‚ÄòCause I put it
(Down like that, put down like that)
And I'm making
(All these racks, all these racks)
And I'm moving
(Round like that, moving round like that)
When I do it
(I don't look back, don't look back)

I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

They love the way I walk
‚ÄòCause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am

Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill

Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around

Just tell me how it's looking babe

High like treble, pumping on the mids

And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue?

If I were a boy
even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

There a time I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own

And how can I pretend that I don t know what s going on?
When every second and every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up and here me sing
Stand up for love

Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air, cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes

Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

Shawty, what your name is?
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me
So press record, I'll let you film me

On your video phone, make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

I love how you approach me
Fresh white with your pants hangin' grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore

Swag up, it's bright, one blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby you doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here

You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone

I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I'm wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call, they better see me on your video screen

You're bad for me I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strain
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch with it to
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addiction, I caint lie

Kiss me one more time before I die

You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive

Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me

Don¬¥t pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years

If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

"I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me,"
Flow is just the nicest

I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
That's good for my ego

And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league

Yeah B, talk ur shit, partner let me upgrade u
How u gon' upgrade me? What's higher than number one?
U know I used to beat that block and now I be's the block
Partner let me upgrade u

I hear u be the block but I'm the life that keeps the streets on
Notice u the type that like to keep them on a leash tho'
I'm known to walk alone but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me

Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, u need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip, or a ego
But what u think they all mad at me fo'?

U need a real woman in ur life
(That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly
(That's a good look)
And I'ma help u build up ur account

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever-complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you

And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls

And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

Cause he's taken you for granted

With you and God, who's my sunlight I'll bloom and grow so beautifly
Baby I'm so proud, so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go on away from this cold and mixed-up world

Dangerously in love with you

Just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin me

We in trouble but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted

Did you forget where your heart lives?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm not nobody

You gon' make me call somebody

Somehow somewhere I'll be naughty
You know I hate sleeping alone

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't

I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Turn the lights on!

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air, cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio

Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo

The only one that papa allowed to hang out in my room with the door closed
We'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom--'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out on my window another moonlight
And he, be keepin' me close so I never let him go

She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?

When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused

And though you break my heart

And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe

I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it.
Cause they'd stick up for me.

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man.
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone

Disrespect us, no, they won't

Boy, this beat is crazy

Houston, Texas, baby

This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves
And get more money later

I think I need a barber
None of these can fire me
I'm so good with this
I remind you I'm so hood with this

And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe

I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl

And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you doin' somethin' right

You say you love my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me

You're bad for me I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strain
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch with it to
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addiction, I caint lie

Kiss me one more time before I die

You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive

Your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air, cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cuz I know I don't understand
Just how your love your doing no one else can.
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

Into your own all 'cause you won't

I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge,
I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit

These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma

Want me to come around and give you good karma
But no, we escalating, up in this bitch, like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn!

Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine

You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless

Woo! You will never need another lover
Woo! Cause you a milf and I'm a motherfucker
Told you give the drummer some, now the drummer cummin'
I'm pa rum pa pum pumin' all on your stomach
Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' stripper to a super C.E.O
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do
I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary
I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl, ooooh
That's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl, we just messed up a brand new couch, girl
You ain't on site then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl

Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect twice

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

Of gold-plated Earl, cause
Everything I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl
She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me,"
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
That's good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! They scream, stop breathin'
Queen Bey on the scene, they fleein'
You can talk all ya want, keep feedin'
Main course, you the season'
I been rollin' in high places livin' larger than life
I kept it real from the beginning, why he made me his wife
You see it's dignity and privacy that sets us apart
Stay hatin' on my happiness, it's to my happiness

Sold out shows
Records broke
Millions sold
I been grindin' hard since I was six years old
Now I'm on the throne
Say what you want
You ain't never seen it done like this before

Moment of silence, we put the haters to sleep
They tryin' to stop us from shinin', we throwin' S-H-A-D-E
But I'm so done with the kindness cause they must think that I'm weak
Listen, this will be the first and the last time I speak

See I be hitting em' with the silent treatment
(Y'all killing my, I'm gon' kill em' all)
Hitting them with the silent treatment
(Dun, dun killing my)
Killin' em' with the silent treatment
(Y'all killing, I'm gon' kill em' all)
Hitting em' with the silent treatment

Shawty, what your name is?

Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me
So press record, I'll let you film me

On your video phone, make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

I love how you approach me
Fresh white with your pants hangin' grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore

Swag up, it's bright, one blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby you doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here

You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone

I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I'm wantin'

Oooh Oooooh (Adlibs)
Oooh Oooh
On A star

And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes.
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

Don't try to tell me this ain't real (I know I'm young)
It's in the way he makes me feel (I know I'm young)
I think my baby is the one (I know I'm young)
It's in the way he holds it down (I know I'm young)

I know you think that this is real (You're too young)
I know exactly how you feel (You're too young)
Too young to know if he's the one (You're too young)
Girl, you got time so slow it down

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

It's too complicated to explain my relationship
My friends are hatin' 'cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'

A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
Don't just stand there on the wall
Everybody just move your body
Move your body, move your body
Move your body, move your body

Can you get me bodied? I wanna be myself tonight

For some strange reason (huh)
You done pleasin me like it's ok (Oh oh ooooh)
Like a perm that's been left too long
It's like a burn

Now it's all coming so clear to me now

Misinterpreted all of my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you
Than I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)

Hey!

He said I'm worth it
his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
his one and only
this beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

Let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it

Bass (Uh)
Hi hat (Uh)

Jay? (Uh-huh.)
Ready? (Uh-huh.)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh. C'mon.)

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's D√©j√† Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
