Young Bino in the house like an B&E
Why I'm looking so fly
I'm just being me
Moved up, weed
In my girl clutch
White girls so
The twelve ain't never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god
Need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down
Then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique
There's alot of us
Talk shit

Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably

I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me

We can get along sometimes
We ain't gotta be sincere
You ain't gotta laugh so small
Breathing all down my back
They ain't never had what we had
They ain't never felt like that
Cause them summer days
Never fade away

And them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, no no

It's those summer days
Never fade away

One time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well
It looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night you were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was, yours
It was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me on this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends

Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like it's so cold

Get another bullet and I spray bullet (bullet)

Now I’m dirty martini, ‘cause this boy met world like Feeny

Nigga you know how we do

I'll eat a fancy ass sandwich on some fancy ass bread

No homo for you niggas homophobic.

Yes, I back bend these girls aerobic.
And these hoes got a Spiderman like Toby.
Keep these girls wet, call them Lakers like Kobe.
Got money trees, asking me, "Do you row me?" [?]

I, miss you more than puffy missed b.i.g
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
In my life, you need to be my wife
I made this song, i hold my pillow tight
And wishin' it was you, what can a nigga do
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When i was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When i was blue, you were blue, you're my smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet

Girl, i need you like i need air
And fuck those other honeys, i will be there
I never ever, ever thought that i would be scared
Of living in a world when you're not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck

Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whatever you like, make it feel good

Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good

Now that we have found this love, baby
These haters can't say shit, oh

Uh uh
Yeah we gon' get it
Yeah

Oh no no no

We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try

Young Bino in the house like an B&E
Why I'm looking so fly
I'm just being me
Moved up, weed
In my girl clutch
White girls so
The twelve ain't never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god
Need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down
Then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique
There's alot of us
Talk shit
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Oh no no, yeah
I know the secret we share
Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably

I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
(I'm just playing tho)

Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen

I think there's something for us

I just wanna roll with a cutie one
I ain't tryna catch no feels
We can get along sometimes
We ain't gotta be sincere
You ain't gotta laugh so small
Breathing all down my back
They ain't never had what we had
They ain't never felt like that
Cause them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, my mind
And them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, no no

It's those summer days
Never fade away
It just stays the same

One time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well
It looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night you were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was, yours
It was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me on this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends

Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like it's so cold

Alright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass Appeal, orange rind
Smoke your green, I'm spending mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware this shit is potent
E.E. cumming on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss move something
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, the swag two button
Yeah, these girls be acting crazy when they're dancing, Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
This beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so its time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with yo girl when we last seen each other
Yeah, you fucking with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
My dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper, man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me

Chyeah

Childish Gambino, lame niggas never heard of it
Sickboy is the crew, fuck these niggas with a dirty dick
When these motherfuckers gonna understand I’m serious?
I’m hard in the paint like I fuck her on a period
James Dean swag, leather jacket, white t-shirt
Rolled-up sleeves, nigga lookin’ like a greaser
Word is born, baby, my dictionary’s in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum
Man, why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?
Won’t be on the Freshmen list, guess I’ll just keep spittin’ shit
Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day
I was hopin’ they would see me just for me, dope rhymer

It seems like they all want me to fail
But I'm not goin' back
Not goin' back, baby
Please tell me you don't want me to fail
‘Cause I'm not goin' back
Not goin' back
I coulda been a tragedy
That's why these fake niggas who call me "pussy" are mad at me
‘Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart
Ain't you read the fuckin' book, Things Fall Apart?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kickin' ass and takin' names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Callin' me the new Will Smith, that's Jaden
Callin' me a faggot when I'm rappin', that's hatin'
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y'all sayin'?
Step inside the party, y'all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis
I'm the boss, Michael Scott, y'all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y'all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back
Don't you know that I'm a rapist, ask a track
Whiskey-sippin', wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fuckin' hate me, that's what I'm used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
God damn, man, there's gotta be a better way
Than pill-poppin' all these drugs so I can stay awake

Who's in love with you now?

Who's in love with you now?
I swear to god... I swear to god, I am.
Nobody really wants ya.

First off, let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine.
So, I probably used the b word a couple times.
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine.
but what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign.
When we were making out, you kinda act like it was nothin'.
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or somethin'.
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends.
You fucked me in that different way. I guess it all depends.
Texting on my day off. "Hey babe, what's going on?
Sorry I can't make it out." Sad face, emoticon.
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on.
I told you, I'm a soldier, need a girl scout to tag along.
Face down, ass up. That's the way you left me.

Hair smell like that OG, write verse on no sleep
Can't breathe, it's so deep, can't breathe, it's so deep
Nosebleeds are your seats
Courtside, with a girl with an ass like a horse ride
And she bad for my heart like a pork rind, heart attack
Tell that nigga I was poor and I ain't goin' back
But now I'm richer, all I need's a fuckin' almanac
Somebody check the time, been gone for a minute
Somebody check the dick, I've been long for a minute
Sean Paul for a minute, man gimme the light

Hot on my own, check your tone, check your stance homie
You don't even like me, you just trynna get my fans homie
So nerdy but the flow wordy
Brain-freezin' with the flow slurpie
Ice cold but you know I burn cash like I had herpes
Not true, but I'm that dirty

I was in a coma but I stayed with you
I'll be right by your side, radio play me that new 3005
Bino won't die, illest rapper alive
See what's up with Fredo when I'm out in the Chi
Murder everything I touch, but I don't know why
And he can get the business, your girlfriend love me
Turn it up, who is this? Shots at your fitted
Gra-ta-ta, are we not that fly?
Are we not young God, is this not black excellence?
I could lie to you people but my soul too sensitive
Gam-b, y'all ain't got shit on me, man I'm so fly, like XYZ
Threat to the throne, man, I'ma murder this
You are such a poser, you ain't ever heard of this
Shots at you fake boys walkin' 'round in turtlenecks
And a du-rag? Wanna be me so bad
And the hair so homeless, record labels want us
Bino well read, like Octobers
Hit me on my Snapchat, hit me on my Nextel Chirp
Run up on them boys, get murked
Nigga sit down, he can't stand me
Curly black hair, bright pink panties
Blush on the vanity, tanner with her ass out
We don't have to love each other, she just wanna cash out
Stone Mountain bitch, run it off a mixtape
This is for my niggas up in Onyx getting shitfaced
He just dropped a mixtape, she got so excited
Took her to a Clippers game and niggas ain't invited
Drugs on the rider, need to clean my act up

Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future

[Verse 1]
What the fuck do y’all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
And niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not
I’m not trying to come hard, I’m trying to come me
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free
What’s the point of rap if you can’t be yourself, huh?
That’s why I come first like my cell phone
I’m a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it’s dumb, that’s the fucking reason I’m doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
‘Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that’s not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That’s not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
’Cause I ain’t Mumford, I ain’t tryin’ to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton

I just wanna roll with a cutie one
I ain't tryna catch no feels
We can get along sometimes
We ain't gotta be sincere
You ain't gotta laugh so small
Breathing all down my back
They ain't never had what we had
They ain't never felt like that
Cause them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, my mind
And them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, no no

It's those summer days
Never fade away
It just stays the same

One time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well
It looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night you were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was, yours
It was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me on this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends

Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like it's so cold

But I'd have a sex change just so I could have your baby

Mapquest where the place is
Gats in they faces
Then we fold them up and put them back in they cases
Assassins replace expressions on faces
And hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces
Hands full of aces, pockets on swole
Glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll
Leave JFK's head just a big smoky hole
To console Jackie O she could smoke my pole
It's called Camelot 'cause she came a lot
And a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot
And the game is still out there if you play or not
And I'm the King of Queens, Kevin James is not
I quit my temp job 'cause I can't let a day go
Tomorrow's moguls are delivering your bagels
I hope your trophy wife been practicing her kegels
Cause when we take the game we won't leave you any Legos
There go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on
Dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on Bleecker on
Give your girl head, call you with the speaker on
Horse head in your bed, now you know who you sleeping on
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
This booth is a crime scene
Chalk off the mic, the kill screen is my screen
No need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses
They only testified they know what hot shit this is
True assassins

And if you don’t do that you can Skype me

I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
Hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
Used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights
Putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"

There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside

And every black "you're not black enough"
Is a white "you're all the same"

Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
Cuz its oreos, twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said I want a full house
They said, "You got it dude!"
All these haters

I had a dream I ran Atlanta, and I was on every radio station. And 107.9 was 97.5 again. And they played me at Golden Glad on Friday.
And they played me real loud on the street, we drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel.
I reopen 112, and Jazzy T's. I'd bring back Turner Field. I fire at all the cops in Cobb county.
Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays. I bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik. [?], Lou. I got J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls girls with big booties. I reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's day off, and I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape

Hey this is Steve Smith from American Dad, and this is Royalty

I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em
Nigga I was stunin', keep that shit a hunnid
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about

After selling out the Georgia Dome 3 nights in a row, after selling 10 million copies of his newest album, Roscoe's Wetsuit, in one week. After successfully petitioning to recarve his own face into Stone Mountain, Stone Mountain. He's still givin' you niggas a free mixtape. Why Gambino, why young guy? Why so generous?

I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em
Nigga I was stunin', keep that shit a hunnid
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about progress, ain't about success
Why this nigga suspect?
You ain't sees sus yet
I'mma fuck the game so hard like [?]
Niggas takin' shots, I'm like "nigga don't tempt me"
I seen what you make, yeah them shows sold out
But you doing clubs and I'm doing like all out, things
Why the hell he rapping if all out sync

I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young got answer
Ghost on my wrist, got me so Casper
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one

But when you see us y'all never say shit

Pussy niggas, y'all say shit and don't do shit
Flew your girl to Saint Lucia
Oh, these niggas are not from Atlanta, these niggas are not from Atlanta
Cause I'm from Atlanta and we would just handle it
Struggle rap, Canibus
Amethyst, my weed purple
Rap game, I'm Steve Urkel, Urquelle
She want some pics, I'm like "oh well, you better Google search"
Money rule my universe
Nigga we made it
We had the beat and then we heard the verse and said "nigga we hate it"

I walk up in the party, we took all the bitches
They love how I move, we might need a minute
God damn, Summer looking like son of Sam, I'm killin' niggas
Hang with models and a couple strippers
She love my music so I nutted in her
Damn I'm decent, Liam Neeson

Smile on her face best believe she wearing nothing else
Watch the sun set that's a feeling that she never felt
We were born free, that's my god given
How a god living? Fantastic, fans spazz when they see ya man passing
I'm in the Aston Martin, unforgivable blackness beg your pardon
All my Jack Johnson nigga, all my shows sell tix like Boston nigga
Put this on at the cook out, let me see you shmoney
Old school on the XM got your Auntie singing "Hola Hola Ayy"

Niggas is different, you chicken, we ain't fucking with poultry
Bunch of crab ass bloggers got me allergic to shellfish

Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs

I'm ready to go

Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, no
I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland

Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
'Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?!"
I'm chillin', real nigga feeling
Rich kid, asshole
Paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow
DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts
pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so
Hip deep in that Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo, you faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though?
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so e-m-o?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano

Yo' girl, she jocking these

Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do

I had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over islands
There were so many pretty people

I talked to some birds

And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going and going
And even when you laughed, when you cried
And even when you were sad you were really happy
Because you were here
And I got to meet every star, every planet
Everything that made me
And we all kissed
And became the same
We became the same

Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized,
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes.

And I rap about my life, and niggas think it's a joke, nah

Yes, I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga
Step away from the heat, they Shaquille-in' on a nigga

Watch the swagga get swiped like a card, bought 'em

You got it wrong like saying OJ; IJ
Stop the rumors
Asian girls don't got sideways
I gotta fuck every shade of latte
I gotta flow like my mouth to Kanye's

Where did you go?
I've been running around the world
Gotta let you know

I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part
Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star
I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon
When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing
And we do the I like you like like you like like thing
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes
I would swear ya'll converted to rap for the jokes
I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope
They make anti-me PSA's cuz I'm dope
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod
You just hear 'nope'
Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin'

Girl, i messed up real bad
I'm looking back on the days that we both had
I go to bed and i dream so hard
Of little mixed kids running in the front yard
I need you close, i need your kiss
I never ever, ever, ever knew a love like this
I, miss you more than puffy missed b.i.g
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
In my life, you need to be my wife
I made this song, i hold my pillow tight
And wishin' it was you, what can a nigga do
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When i was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When i was blue, you were blue, you're my smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet

Girl, i need you like i need air
And fuck those other honeys, i will be there
I never ever, ever thought that i would be scared
Of living in a world when you're not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck
When you play this song on your macbook

I got skinny jeans on, so i got my swagger
I got new kicks and embarrass my?
A skinny tattoo with a paintball space
So a nigga got bounce like a pinball game
I got housewives like my name was bravo
The dude is bueller, the world chicago
I'm hard to follow, ya boy's sick
I'm adam sandler so fuck ya clique
I hang with dogs like michael vick
And ya girls get wet like a glass of quick
Cause your boy stay fresh like a bunch of mints
And i fight this flow like a pacifist
A barrel of monkeys, a house of chimps
I'm way more fun than your boyfriend is
He need new jeans like a accident
Cause your boy right here where the action is, ah!

(hook)
Don't talk about it
You can live without it
You don't even need to go down?

Baby I'm living the dream
With you by my side we work as a team
I know I'm a mac, it's not what it seems
I'm covered in pink, from swimming in green
When I'm eating you like Edy and me
Mama the stars could not intervene
You are a star, I'm keeping it clean
You are the prettiest girl I have seen
What does that mean? It means you're the one
And most of these dudes are just fucking for fun
Girl you know that I would never do that to you
All of the girls that I do must be beautiful
Inside and out, meaning your mouth
Girl I'm just playin', this is what I'm sayin'
If you like real, then give me a go
If you never try, then you'll never know

Ooh it's alright, ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
And if the sun don't come out
Ooh it's okayExplain

in the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith
sixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice
but they don't like me
because I'm too nice
and I'm kinda fat
and not the dope type

But I grew out of that
And it's a miracle
not every girl sees me as marrying material
It's a buyers market
I'm Alicia's target
And every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet

I love these hipster girls
and they feel the same
now they don't have to choose when someone asks them Drake or Wayne
and niggas waiting on me
we didn't have a voice
we used to have to act street but now you've got a choice

my momma's brownie mix
i keep the goodies moist
of every girl i'm tappin
this wasn't supposed to happen
hard to keep my thoughts straight
on every date
especially when my penis talking
SWAT team, cover me
i'm going in.

Sing. Uh.

Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

I do not talk.

I do not talk. I am just a rapper.

Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming cheeto
I'm tighter than baby speedos
I'm shifting another kilo
And that's because my shits dope
Walking past the red rope
The bouncer is my kin folk
So I don't need credentials

Sick boy is my clique
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I do not, I do not, I am just, I am just a rapper
Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried bout my wallet being empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain
And this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
...

Niggas wanna have some, all I want's to have it all
They wanted something different, nigga problem solved
Drunk off the high life, death is when I'll sleep it off
Life's a hangover and this rappin' shit's my tylenol
I could call any girl in my phone right now
Have a pillow in her mouth watch her bite down
She like me cause I'm flier than a kite now
It's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes
Always do me like I love self portraits
Now these fake niggas say "Hey" like horse shit
People treat me different but I'm still the same person
I don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original
Wallet stay healthy: vitamins, minerals
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now my shit has got them dancing like I channel Oakenfold

Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck

My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
...

I do not talk, I am just a rapper
I am just a rapper
Gambino keep it jumping
These niggas don't know nothing
I keep a girl shaky like her pussy lips is krumping
It's that dude that don't say shit
Leave the ad-libs at the door
Because I am just a rapper like the condoms on my floor
Nigga look at me
Man, yeah I'm all geeked out
Got the tortoise shell frames, Tom Ford pea coat
I'm a lot more dope, I'm a lot more fly
And my wallet stay fat, but I starve my tie

You feel like summertime
You took this heart of mine
You'll be my valentine in the summer, in the summer
You are my only one

She feel like summer
This feel like summer

Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, faster and not a chance to slow down
Slow down

They're just tryna tell the children please slow down
Slow down

Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for a boy like that to go wrong
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, oooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)

Jump so high

Tie me down, try to hold me up
But the wall ain't high enough
They play so hard
In a game so rough
But I still can't
Give it up

I'm out here on my own
Work but I got to get some
Run right into the sun
Ohhh (jump so high)
(so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right (so high, high, high)
I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right

Find your light
