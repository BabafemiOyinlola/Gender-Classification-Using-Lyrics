If you live for something, youre not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, and toast to life

Luda!

They say what dont kill me, can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tip toe through life, to arrive safely at death
Im on a journey, yeah, Im on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes, just to open my soul
And tonight is the night, I gotta feeling that Im about act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher are about to break some rules

Going nowhere fast
We've reached our climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now?
When I need you around
I'm on my knees, but it seems we're

Going nowhere fast

Girl you can keep that, trying to make me jealous

I know why you did that
You're frustrated cause I don't react
Maybe you want some feedback
Cause normally my feelings don't show
But baby I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
And I wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get is what you see
The truth is girl underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you

Intro:
How's life
Great
Everybodies going through something
You gotta get over it
You can't go around
Let's just enjoy the time
Verse 1:
The night... is young... you know
We've just just begun
Let's have... some fun
Until the moon turns to the sun... yeah
Look out the dj's got this party jumpin'
It's easy to let loose when you're sippin' something
Relax
Its what you deserve
There's no need... to be reserved... no
Chorus:
Show me what you're made of
Will be goin' goin'
All night can you stay up... stay up
Show me what you're made of
Will be goin' goin'

Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home
Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know if you're ready

She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off, and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...

You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me?
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

I'll be anticipating
What you would do to me

Let me put my shades on

You got it twisted
Now tell me why you wanna do me that way

You introduced it, you know I don't play

You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted it, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I suffer from delusion, I should put myself way

All the time and money I've spent
Can't believe what I'm in, it ain't right
If I comeback, you promise it's gon be you and me
And that's it?
"Whatever..."
No?

You got it twisted
Now tell me why you wanna do me that way

I know you think i'm afraid
To take a chance,
Go into the deep end
Usher baby
Turn the lights on

These waters... can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trecking through the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me baby
Shedding all your innocence
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until i'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed

When you give it all, you get it all
What happened to you, yeah

From the beginning
Knew I was getting
But I was with it, and i'll admit that
She was clear there was some kind of pain
It woulnd't be easy for me to let it go
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time
I got ahead some got left behind
The world is yours, just sign that dotted line
And in no time, I had,

Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I didn't have a ball
You could say I made it
But i'm faded

Cause I miss you, can we go back
But the issue this we can get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
Cause I miss you, can we go back
What happened to you
Youuuu ooh ohh
Doo doo doo doo
I'm happy for you
Youuuu ooh ohh
Ohh ohh
What happened to you

Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys
I stayed on their mind, mine was on the money
Had whatever, whenever

Walking with my head down
Counting every step
Hoping that the next one
Brings me closer to the man I was
Cause I was way better
Maybe its because
We were together

I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow I ran right into

Youuuu
(looking for myself)
Youuuu
(I, I I, I I I)
Youuuu
(looking for myself)

And somehow I ran right into you

Escaping on the tightrope
Trying not to fall
If I don't keep my balance

They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Live it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill,
Only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real,
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

Some things never change here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care any more
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

I can feel you now

Turn the light on!
How could someone hurt you
But still make you feel so good?
How the screaming...
You stand there and let them good
Just cause he gives you pain,
That don't mean he ain't the one!
Fuck you at your brain, you'll be smiling when he's done

So my advice would be
No, don't leave, don't go so easy!
Let the argue... turn you on!
It's worthy!

And these are the lessons learned by love
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye

Please forgive me!
What now, I think this woman’s waiting for a…
What now, why I let her go and put that sex on me
What now, I pop this shit I watch that girl undress for me
Uh standing her perfume in the air
Got it feeling different in here, yeah
Yeah, she took my breath away
On to some fancy shit into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

Chorus:
Oh, it’s the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who’s a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money,

You should let me pay the trade you everything
You got me being unexcited
Baby step into my room I might grow
Don't need a wedding ring

How 'bout we can braise the danger

We gonna do whole lot of.

I had a dream when I was just a little boy
To find a girl like you
We would meet at the park at school
And talk till the day was through
.take a pair of tones
And I would comb your hair
And you would dream of all the cities
And places we could go

Oh, oh, oh
Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart out close to my ear
We would live to know the time
We could stay till the days turns in night.

I can still remember dreams as a little boy

Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes

Long as you coming home, girl, I don't mind

The ballers in here tonight, they gon' buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon' make it colossal in here
Cause shawty you thinkin' them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?

I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Shawty, I don't mind If you dance on a pole
That don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind when you work until three

Uh, uh huh
Gangster

(Verse 1)
I though it was love
Didn't wanna admit that
When I looked back
It was lust
Too bad I had to learn a lesson
They were against me
You were with me
But you never let your old thang go
I don't care to know why
Girl I guess some things
Can't be explained

(Chorus)
It is what it is (what it is)
I don't know what to call it
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)

It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (uh huh)
When it's really something else

(Verse 2)
Know that is okay
Felt something going on
For every time that I fought it (uh)
Girl I bet that's what it was
Called myself being down for you (ice cold)
Just know that
Even if I already knew you
I already knew how you get down (uh)
But if that's your thang, babe
I ain't mad at you
It's cool
Just know I did it too

Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone

It’s like whatever I do
Just can’t get through to you
I’m never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can’t be found
I lost my way, she said she’d stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back
I know sorries, just wouldn’t do it
Her heart is obliterated, I’m trying to travel through
But it’s like moving mountains
It’s like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It’s like moving mountains
It’s like moving mountains

Why you just leave me, just leave me be

Yo, after tonight

[Intro] (2x)
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell 

[Verse 1]
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

(Verse 1)
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

(Chorus)
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over

She caught me by surprise

Got me feelin' it

Youre gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours

Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

I'm always on the top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me

Hey, hey
Hey what's happenin' e'erybody
I hope they get my good side
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
You know I know the camera's following
I know they taking pictures, right Drama
Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that
This goin' make a hell of a movie huh!

My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
Will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now

Sorry for the prolong

And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin'
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed... come on... yeah)

Usher
Yeah, man

So we back in the club
With our bodies rocking from side to side, side-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life, back-back to life

Hands up
And suddenly, we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance
Like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Keep downing drinks like there's
No tomorrow, there's just right now, now, now, na-na-now, now

Baby your wish will be my command


Cause I'll touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body

My guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire
Caught in a love affair with feminine iconic style
So fine; you got good taste
But I hate to see your pretty body going to waste
Prefer to see you in the bare necessities
Like Coco de Mer or La Perla baby
Getting me aroused in that intimate attire;
Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like
Vicky got a secret, everybody knows;
Lady in the street, in-bed hoes baby
Wearing Cosabella, with nothing but a trench coat;

Nothing's better
Girl you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it;
If you add a little spice you can have alot of fun
(You know what I'm talking 'bout)
Cuz I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong; the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder, Do
G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on; is it on, girl?
Girl you're a goddess, when you slip that Eres on
Don't stop, your sexy silhouette

When you be putting your heels on
I swear your body's so perfect baby
How you work it baby yea
I love the way that you be poking it out
Girl give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby

Oh for you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violins it's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for you
For you I'd be
Running a thousand miles
Just to get where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby listen

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else I promise girl I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody I-I need somebody

I need somebody I-I need somebody to love

Everyday I'll bring the sun around
I'll sweep away the clouds
Smile for me
I will take every second every single time
Spend it like my last dime

Said you'll neva give away your heart again
I'll be knockin' till you let me in
I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
That's why I no longer wanna be a stranger

Sorry you put your trust in others
And they let you down
And all the the secrets and the unknown evidence
Now in the open that you found

Cried yourself to sleep so many nights
Said you'd never again
I'm not the one you hold it against
Baby, it's not my plan

[Bridge]
Yeah, you independent as hell
And doin' it by yourself
But what you gon' do
When the nighttime gets cold?

I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me

Right now, it's about that time
Touch’n you, touch’n you, touch’n you
Look how you turn me on baby

Singing is beleving, USHER, baby
Turn the lights on

She kissing on me, biting on my bottom lip
In the gallery all I get is buy me this
Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn
Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan
Mean hustle got me chasing all this fast money
Viliaci all the sneakers, now she touching cash money
So sexy in them all black and sepy heels
50 stacks in her bag so she know it’s real
Top of the Ferrari now we thugged out
Smoking on that callie bumping 2Pac
It’s me against the world now what’s your phone number
Jumping in that range rover and I’m coming over!

Touch’n you, touch’n you
Been thinking bout you all day
Touch’n you, touch’n you
Still can’t get my mind off your body

We need to leave it alone
Move on

Hold up
Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility will you accept the charges?
Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

Sittin' in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
That night, I would've got murdered

He perdido el balance por tu amor
En tus manos yo caí, tienes control sobre mi
Tu cuerpo es la cárcel y yo un prisionero
Y jamás quiero salir, condenado y soy feliz

Try to keep my balance but I still fall
But how I fall so hard
Right into your arms, I swear girl
Wrapped inside you, baby, and it's so warm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love without a cause
Leaves me trapped inside my own bars

Quiero ser tuyo enterito pero tengo miedo
Prometeme que no me vas a dejar sin tu amor
(Talk to her Usher)

I'll give you my heart, girl, but you got to promise
Prométeme mami
Promise you'll hold me (hold me)
Touch me (touch me)
Love me
Way past forever

Hasta siempre

It's like whatever I do
Just can't get through to you
I'm never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back
I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains

It's like moving mountains

Why you just leave me, just leave me be

You'll be stuck in my head like a melody

You must be crazy

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence it was meant to be
Don't be shy, gon' let ya boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends you was on the remix like

One time if you ain't scared, say wussup

jimmy's just a bum 
who wants to hold on to the past 
he tries to be a tough guy 
but dumb kids come in last 
he says he'll win her heart 
his love life is a mess 
he calls his Dream Girl destiny 
and she calls him obsessed

he says he'll take my girl away 
but i don't really care 
and i don't worry 
i know that he wants her 
but it's plain to see

There's a long and windy road that we have traveled
And the price that waits for all who will prevail
There's a place for those who stand up tall and battle
Up against our lives determine not to fail
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready
To push yourself beyond where you have gone before (never before)
So write your name beside the very best in history
and take a bow Before the crowd and hear them roar
Anything you can do this is from me to you

Just keep dreamin
Keep on dreamin (gotta believe)
And if you really believe in time you will make your dreams come true
(uh just keep dreamin)
Keep dreamin don't stop dreamin
Cause no one else can live a dream but you

So you rise above each hurdle you encounter

See it's a shame that when you're working on doing well
People hate you, yeah
Buying nothing that's not the best for yourself
Then they really hate you, yeah

You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let 'em make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

If you work hard then play hard
Dig that
And do what you wanna do

Don't let what people say bother you

But can you dig that?

Nobody wants to be alone

Hang up and you call right back

And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you

But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming

But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn
Let it burn...

Gotta let it burn

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

Usher, Usher, yeah man, true story
Real G? s with me on this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Wifey home, wedding band, I? m a lucky man
You? d think I? d be satisfied and truthfully, yes I am
But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets

My Mac is in my backpack, I? m surfing on the sites
I? m chatting, this ain? t cheating, just telling myself a lie
And it? s almost like I? m caught up and living another life
Man, I? m hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

Tempted I must confess
But I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best
Put my B.S. under arrest

? Cause I love my lady
Fellas if ya love your girl
Fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

Could? ve picked up the phone
Could? ve ended up doing wrong
Man I, I was on
But I ate my dinner at home

? Cause I love my lady
Fellas if ya love your girl
Fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

I? m not trying to be late, rush through security gates
With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed
No rooms left in the Mender Inn, I gotta figure out a play
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way
...

Ohhh ohhhh
Ohhhhh ohhh
Ohhhhh yeaa

Listen
I'd be a liar if I told you
That I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said
Hey I didn't want it to be something
You deserve much better
For the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it
But girl I swear
That I got love for you
Big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that
You will always be my baby
My baby

But take the truth
Baby take the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't pretise cause they both look right
Someone tell me what's a man to do
When he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie
But he can't tell the truth

...

I can't let nothing come in between the two of us? Cause it's like you? re all I need since we've been together
And whenever I'm in need of a little love
It's okay for me to open up
But I just can't give my heart to anyone? cause
Some only come in your life for a season

And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it? s forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me are you willing to take a chance? Baby, if so
Here we go, here we go

Let me put you in my hands
Come on, come on
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right
So that you be with me a lifetime? Cause you know and I know
Don't think that I'm talking crazy

Your mama and my mama want some grand babies
Tonight would you be with me a lifetime?

Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it?

Is it because he treated you badly
I always stand accused?
Protecting yourself from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl

And it's killing me girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win, no

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay paying for his mistakes

When you be putting your heels on
I swear your body's so perfect baby
How you work it baby yea
I love the way that you be poking it out
Girl give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby

You can't control, no
But gravity compels you to ignite and explode, oh

'Til our time and space combine
You'll fantasize the unknown, oh

Girl, it's taking off the ground
You know how I put it down
Have you seen your stars, baby?

This is big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control?
Mars vs Venus, yeah, when the worlds collide

This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can take desire?

Seduce and analyze, yeah
Objective is to conquer deep inside
Make paradise

Shot and split you, fuck splitting the profits with you

Clicks with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks

Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doin he're?
Get me outta here

We don't play those games

As I walk thru the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's much left
'Cause I've been brassin' and laughin' so long that
Even my Mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You'd better watch how you talkin', and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be like a chap
I really hate to check but I gotta look
As they croak I see myself in the pistals smoke ... fool
I'm the kind of cheater little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise

They got the situation, they got me facin'

Watch me as I dance under the spotlight-
listen to the people screaming out more, and more
Cos I create the feeling that keep em coming back,
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep em coming back,
So captivating when I get it on the floor.

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it,
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that Monster in the mirror,
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner.
Best when under pressure with seconds left I show up.

If you really want more, scream it out louder,
if you on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more.

Won't commit so we choose to run away

Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back
I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains

I mean Usher is this what it come to, man?
This how we gon’ do it? I mean even grass grow baby
You know seeds become plants, boys become men
What we gon’ do? Let’s lead the way

Wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What’s my demeanor?
The grass is always greener on the other side
Then think about, can’t give a ring up
I couldn’t give a ***, how could I give a finger

Let alone half bath and closets
So claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
Now it’s sort of like two car garages
It’s like two broads menagin’
You’re the best mama

Is there any chance that you remember me
Being any more than just a horrible man?
And would you consider pullin’ this trigger
And taking a second shot at romance?

Oh baby I want the days when you were my girl
And I was your man
Know I took you for granted but it wasn't 'til now
I see how much I miss you

Girl, I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once here goes the truth

It's only you for you, girl

Remember, remember, remember, remember
 (You changed my life in so many ways)
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember?
 (I just look back to how I used to be)

Would you remember, remember, remember, remember?
 (And how you dealt with me)
Would you remember, remember, remember?
 (Just want to thank you for)

Just in case I never see your face again
Just in case the worst was meant to happen
Just in case tomorrow never come
There is something you should know, oh

I've given you every bit of the man I am
I know at times it wasn? t pretty but it was all I had
I never held back, not one lil? bit and the world can attest to this
That, baby, you flipped my program upside down
 (Listen to me, now)

I was a hustler and player, girl, before I met you
I'd drink a lil? something, hit a lil? something before I met you
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing
You got my life together and I thank you forever

I really used to throw a lot before I met you
But I? d do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it?

Is it because he treated you badly
I always stand accused?
Protecting yourself from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl

And it's killing me girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win, no

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay paying for his mistakes

You? d think I? d be satisfied and truthfully, yes I am
But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets

My Mac is in my backpack, I? m surfing on the sites
I? m chatting, this ain? t cheating, just telling myself a lie
And it? s almost like I? m caught up and living another life
Man, I? m hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

Tempted I must confess
But I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best
Put my B.S. under arrest

? Cause I love my lady
Fellas if ya love your girl
Fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

Could? ve picked up the phone
Could? ve ended up doing wrong
Man I, I was on
But I ate my dinner at home

? Cause I love my lady
Fellas if ya love your girl
Fight that appetite for the ladies

With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed
No rooms left in the Mender Inn, I gotta figure out a play
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way

Big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that
You will always be my baby

But take the truth
Baby take the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't pretise cause they both look right
Someone tell me what's a man to do
When he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie
But he can't tell the truth

Some only come in your life for a season

And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it? s forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me are you willing to take a chance? Baby, if so
Here we go, here we go

Come on, come on

And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry

My way, My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
What I say goes, and I'm in control.

(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
It's 7: 00
On the dot
I'm in my drop top
Cruisin' the streets, Oh yeah
I gotta real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me
I pull up
Anticipating, good love
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I've never seen, girl you know what I mean.

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet

Oh, no, no, no, no...

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone

It’s like whatever I do
Just can’t get through to you
I’m never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can’t be found
I lost my way, she said she’d stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back
I know sorries, just wouldn’t do it
Her heart is obliterated, I’m trying to travel through
But it’s like moving mountains
It’s like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It’s like moving mountains
It’s like moving mountains

Why you just leave me, just leave me be
...

Yo, after tonight

[Intro] (2x)
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell 

[Verse 1]
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

(Verse 1)
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

(Chorus)
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over

I'm the kinda brotha
Who been doin' it my way, gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life I hid love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out why I'm so

Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold on me, yeah

My Momma told me
"Be careful who you do, 'cause karma comes back around"

But I was so sure that it wouldn't happen to me
'Cause I know how to put it down

You gonna come over and pick me up in your ride
You gonna knock, then you gonna wait
Ooh, you gonna take me on a date
Youre gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours

Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

I'm always on the top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
Were trading places

And the price that waits for all who will prevail
There's a place for those who stand up tall and battle
Up against our lives determine not to fail
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready
To push yourself beyond where you have gone before (never before)
So write your name beside the very best in history
and take a bow Before the crowd and hear them roar
Anything you can do this is from me to you

Just keep dreamin
Keep on dreamin (gotta believe)
And if you really believe in time you will make your dreams come true
(uh just keep dreamin)
Keep dreamin don't stop dreamin
Cause no one else can live a dream but you

So you rise above each hurdle you encounter

And the party don't stop

[Usher x5]
Tell me what you gone do
What you gone do what you gone do

[Daz Dillinger]
I met her back in high school, used to dig out her homies
She never snitched on me cuz baby was in love
I was all she would dream of all she would think of
She worked nine to five, I rolled up smokin bud
Independent baby loved to live life exqist
From Atlanta G.A. and plus she new how to kick it
She wan't an erotic stripper
Dancin that's where I first met
Sayin' to myself "I gots to go get her"
Waved a hundred doller bill in the air
Said come here baby pulled up a chair

As I walk thru the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's much left
'Cause I've been brassin' and laughin' so long that
Even my Mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You'd better watch how you talkin', and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be like a chap
I really hate to check but I gotta look
As they croak I see myself in the pistals smoke ... fool
I'm the kind of cheater little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise

They got the situation, they got me facin'
I can't live with no more right, I was raised by the street

Baby... Baby I love you... Baby... Baby I love you.

I got this jones forming in my bones (from a man)
who indeed took over my soul, (understand)
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (he would leave),
get on my knees till they bloody red, (baby please)
see I don't know if you get it yet, (just don't know)
He's like the lighter to my cigarette,
(watch me smoke), I never knew another human life
(didn't know) can have the power to take over mine,
So baby baby.

Uh
This is what I sound like after 5 years
(You back kid)
Why do I feel I still got the floor
(You back kid, Bad Boy for real, Let's go)

Before '99 I was born again
5 years later and I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Me broke, that's a oxy moron
Forget a bus, I bought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry

When I think about your lovin', the Sunday evenings
The fun we use to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over only set aside

Oh it's you Sweet Baby
I will never be free from your embrace, Sweet Baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you Sweet Baby
Ever lost and captured by your smile, Sweet Baby

jimmy's just a bum 
who wants to hold on to the past 
he tries to be a tough guy 
but dumb kids come in last 
he says he'll win her heart 
his love life is a mess 
he calls his Dream Girl destiny 
and she calls him obsessed

he says he'll take my girl away 
but i don't really care 
and i don't worry 
i know that he wants her 
but it's plain to see

Would you mind if I still loved you?
Would you mind if things don't last?
Would you mind if I hold onto
You so that I won't crash?

Morning light, I'm at your door
One last time, and no one's there
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, no...)
Drove all night, just to beat you home
Would you mind if I waited?
Would you mind if I wait right here?

And I really, really, wanna love you
And I'm really only yours
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know
We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go
I'm just being honest, I'm still in the moment

Wait 'til you're announced

Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Dancin' around the lies we tell

They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon

With our bodies rockin' from side to side (side to side)
Thank God the week is done

Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance, like it's the last, last night of your life, life

(Jermaine Dupri Talking:)
Yo See, it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all ya'll other... out there doin' what I'm doin'
Or tryin' to do what I'm doin' but you can't
Cause I do what I do my way.
What about you?
Huh? huh?
Come On.

(Usher:)
I Do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say oh oh.
Why is he so fly-y-y?
She beeps me, whenever she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to
Say whatever you want but she still gon' get it up
Cause she likes it...

Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Usher
My way, My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
What I say goes, and I'm in control.

Cruisin' the streets - Oh yeah
I gotta real pretty, pretty little thang that's waiting for me
I pull up
Anticipating - good love
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I've never seen, girl you know what I mean

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Oh, no, no, no, no...

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone

It’s like whatever I do
Just can’t get through to you
I’m never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can’t be found
I lost my way, she said she’d stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back
I know sorries, just wouldn’t do it
Her heart is obliterated, I’m trying to travel through
But it’s like moving mountains
It’s like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It’s like moving mountains
It’s like moving mountains

Why you just leave me, just leave me be

Yo, after tonight

[Intro] (2x)
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell 

[Verse 1]
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

(Verse 1)
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

(Chorus)
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over

In and out my life I hid love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out why I'm so

Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control

You're gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours
Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

I'm always on the top, tonight I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
We're trading places

That Usher song
Please
Just one more time
You remind me
Like R. Kelly
Of my favorite R&B

I'm in the mood for
Something hot
Something sexy
With the groove on
Go through the records
I'll tell you
What you needa play
I wanna relax my mind
It's been a long day

I'm the kind of brother
Who been doin' it my way, gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)

This girl's got a hold on me

Let me go, baby
Now listen

Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around

And light it up, take it up higher,
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide
**That millions die from three lethal letters
He does shit to make it better
**And I'm thinking of you

[Chorus]
Everyone wants to touch the sky
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants heaven
If you don't want to sacrifice

In awhile I'll do the and it's almost unfair to me
What you want, say baby, you're ready to see

It's so clear to me is it every word I hear you speak is
Whatever I wanna do it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want I can do to you
Whatever I want I can do to you
Whatever you say it's just giving me
Whatever I want baby, I can do, whatever I want

You can't get enough conversation I feel your touch
You're losing point trying to play the role
Let's keep it cool not sexual

But you don't want it for real

And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

both alone in this
it's just me and you
against the world

And there's me
and there's you
It's just me and youÂ
against the world

(Oh girl)

And, what am I supposed to do
the alarms are going off in my head
and It's dangerous
yes It's complicated

No more war, no more war
What are we fighting for
El dolor que trae el fracaso
De la duda y la traición
Veo una vida hecha pedazos
Y ahí es donde nace un campeón

I'll fight for my country
You fight for your country
We see the victory
They'll get the victory
Man a man, heart to heart
Face to face worlds apart
You and I, we're champions
Champions, champions
You fight for my country
I'll fight for your country
We see the victory
They'll get that victory
Man a man, heart to heart
Face to face worlds apart
You and I we're champions
Champions, champions

De amarguras y esperanzas
De las penas y el dolor
De una fé que todo alcanza

She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing

So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven

Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals
(You gotta give me that)

Heartbroken when you left my world

To come out of my mouth to tell you that I'm cheating on you
With this brother that I met and now I'm creepin wit (creepin with)
Got me three months pregnant and now I'm keepin it
First thing that came to mind was you

Second thing that I just don't wanna believe that this is true

And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming

But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn
Let it burn...

Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over

Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)

Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around

So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven

Make every day our love season

And the price that waits for all who will prevail
There's a place for those who stand up tall and battle
Up against our lives determine not to fail
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready
To push yourself beyond where you have gone before (never before)
So write your name beside the very best in history
and take a bow Before the crowd and hear them roar
Anything you can do this is from me to you

Just keep dreamin
Keep on dreamin (gotta believe)
And if you really believe in time you will make your dreams come true
(uh just keep dreamin)
Keep dreamin don't stop dreamin
Cause no one else can live a dream but you

So you rise above each hurdle you encounter

And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it

You make me 
You make me 

Before anything came between us 
You were like my bestfriend 
The one I used to run to when me and my 
Girl was having problems (thats right) 
You used to say it would be okay 
Suggest little nice things I should do 
And when I come home at night and lay my head down 
Sll I seem to think about is you 
And how you make me wanna 

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do

This goes out to my nigga B.I.G.
Listen to me playboy, check dis out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
PD call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

Cause U know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now we can all forget it

After all the wrong you've done to me

'Cause my heart loves you, I'm so confused

Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while

Nobody wants to be alone

Yo, it's time to U-Turn
Ya heard me?
You're either with us or against us, yo

It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball

Remember, the snake and how the floor used to clear
And everybody would break
What's crunk now, used to be called getting to it
We're bringing it all back, this is how we do it, just

Put your hands up
Bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle
Get down with me

Oh, come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn

Put your hands up
Bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle
Get down with me

Oh, come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn

In the 80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the 90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok

I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown, the dance was the running man

I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming

But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn
Let it burn...

Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over

Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it

Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did

How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that

Oh yeah

You got no need to be nervous
Because you are safe in my hands
I'm sure you'll be needin' my service
Baby your wish will be my command


Cause I'll touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

Watch me as I dance under the spotlight

Cos I create the feeling that keep em coming back,
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep em coming back,
So captivating when I get it on the floor
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it,
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that Monster in the mirror,
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder,
if you on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

If you really want more, scream it out louder,
if you on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

She's a greedy girl to never get enough

She don't want love

Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now?
When I need you around
I'm on my knees, but it seems we're

Going nowhere fast

We're together, now we're undone

You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire

So confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

It ain't what you do, its what you do tonight
And there ain't no shortcut to doing something right

Just look around the club 'cause you're here to have a good time

Used to jump up in the Maybach an roll out
Used to care

The love that she's used to give me can't be found
I lost my prey, she's said she'll stay
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold

That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said taht,
Maybe the world has a promise to get us back
And no sorries, you just wouldn't do it

It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep lovin' anyway
We laugh and we cry and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
I'm willing to wait for it
Then, I'm willing to wait for it

But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

If you can think it you can have it that's why I believe

One day you'll be mine, mine

Before anything came between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run to when me and my
Girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I come home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you and how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do

Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute,

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you.
You remind of a girl, that I once knew

Check this out, yeah, yeah
All my niggas take a walk with me
You ain't gotta holla - you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be
And how I stack figures
Learn why I'm real - still that nigga
I get money I ain't gotta do a crime
Shit I hit dimes - what I need with a nine
Before y'all judge me - be clear
We got nothing but heat here, beware WE HERE
What's my name, got chicks twisted like
What's my game?
Pimp things still the same
I smash it, I don't harass it
Ma' I'm a baller I score and pass it
Feel me, still be filthy
If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty
And this is what we came do
Party, Diddy, Usher - game is through, come on

It's right around eleven o'clock
One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all
Niggas will be s- y'all doin' it heavy
She; s telling you she might change
But you tell her not to
She know that she looks stunning
It'll be fine
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got'chu
Me - I think you're running
Cause I'm the one

I don't know what you came to do girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh

Layin' in the cut, kissin' and rubbin' and makin' sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out

And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby

When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend

See it's a shame that when you're working on doing well
People hate you, yeah
Buying nothing that's not the best for yourself
Then they really hate you, yeah

You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let 'em make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

Just pop ya collar
Don't let what people say bother you

And you know good and damn well that

If I wanted I could take you from ya man

With my eyes closed
I could have you eatin' out the palm of my hand

And all your little girlfriends too
(No, you can't get with me and I want you)
Yes, I can and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

Ain't nobody trying clown you
But you too damn old to play high school games with me

Yes, you do, 'cause even when I'm not around you

I just wanna sex you up
I wanna give you everything you need, thing you want, just lay down
Let me love ya all night long

I don't want to leave you, I just wanna keep you
When they saw me they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl that's how I felt
Every time I thought it was right, it went left

We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
(What happened to all the good times)
I tell myself I don't want you no more but
I can't let you go

So much love and hurt and hate

That I thought, would make you happy

'Cause I tried to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind

But never took time to see

Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
(Ah ah ah ah)
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave?
(Please don't go away)
Baby help me
Without you my whole world is fallin' apart, and I'm goin' crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone
(Oh girl, I love you) I need you to come back home
(You know I need you) I don't want to be alone uhh

Girl I put your love up on the shelf
And I guess I just left it to die

now we're not together, 'cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted, we used it to make sweet love

How Do I Say

How do I say?

A foreign beauty, so exotic
When she smiled at me
She took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say...

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful
When I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you
My baby, how do I say, how do I say?

How do I say?

The room was filled with her sweet aroma
When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so hypnotic
In the language that I never will forget

I hear her calling
Spinning around in the crowd 'til she found me
Then she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that I want her, I want her
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
All my life I've never felt quite like this
I've never had a loss for words
One kiss from her has got me speechless

I told my man I'm having a barbecue
So grab some folks and won't you slide right through
He brought this shorty that I used to know
It brought me back to when I was in school
She said Usher where have you been?
We used to kick it every now and then
Remember when I used to call your phone
Tell you come on cause my mother's gone
How about them times I had to throw
A rock at your window
To let you know to come downstairs
And open the door
And after that baby it was on fa'sure

Honey got my head spinnin' around for real
Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel
And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this, huh
But I must admit I'm tempted and startin' to reminisce, cause

Yo, it's time to U-Turn
Ya heard me?
You're either with us or against us, yo

It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball

Remember, the snake and how the floor used to clear
And everybody would break
What's crunk now, used to be called getting to it
We're bringing it all back, this is how we do it, just

Put your hands up
Bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle
Get down with me

Oh, come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn

Put your hands up
Bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle
Get down with me

Oh, come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn

In the 80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the 90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok

I can't forget about my high school days

Why do people stay in situations thatll never work
Thinkin' bout you wanna leave and
You can't wait to get even
When deep inside it really hurts
I never should have gotten in the mix
You never understand till you go through it
All the rights things you say
Wrong things to do
While you're out tryna pick and choose

You should be lookin' for a TTP
Now that I know the difference
That's all I'm tryna be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better
Since I found my total package

You should be lookin' for a TTP

'Cuz we could never act out our parts
If love is the Bible, then we are lost in sin
'Cuz it's not in our hearts
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cuz we're better off, separated
If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark
Love never felt so cold
If love was the light, then we're lost in the dark
Left with no one to hold
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team
You and I are destined to lose
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream

I swear to tell the truth
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
I said
Right hand high, tell a lie
Your honor
Didn't know that I hurt her
Didn't know she was crying
I didn't know it was killing this love
And your honor she can't say I ain't love her
Can't say I ain't tried
But I guess my love wasn't good enough

I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the clubI guess I'm guilty cause girls
always want to show me love
I guess I'm guilty for leaving and having a little fun
Girl I'm guilty for that girl Im guilty
Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
Ohhh
Don't take me to jail
I did nothing to her, gave everything to her
For that
Don't take me to jail
Ohhh
Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
I ain't gonna cry while you make me do the time

And light it up, take it up higher,
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Uh, uh huh
Gangster

(Verse 1)
I though it was love
Didn't wanna admit that
When I looked back
It was lust
Too bad I had to learn a lesson
They were against me
You were with me
But you never let your old thang go
I don't care to know why
Girl I guess some things
Can't be explained

(Chorus)
It is what it is (what it is)
I don't know what to call it
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)

It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (uh huh)
When it's really something else

(Verse 2)
Know that is okay
Felt something going on
For every time that I fought it (uh)
Girl I bet that's what it was
Called myself being down for you (ice cold)
Just know that
Even if I already knew you
I already knew how you get down (uh)
But if that's your thang, babe
I ain't mad at you
It's cool
Just know I did it too

I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that

And with those many ways there comes
A time
For me to say I'll put no girls
Before you
So pretty lady make up your mind

Girl you look surprised
I've got conversation
Cause you ain't checkin'
For the kids swing with no
Girl can't we please
Get past impressions

I'm the kind of brother
Who been doin' it my way, gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold on me

Let me go, baby
Now listen

My momma told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around

Yo after tonight... Don't leave your girl around me
True playa for real ask my nigga Pharrell

Situations will arise, in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I... I loved U, you were my girl
U see I, I, I, I, I... Thought the world of U
but your so steady still leavin baby

U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Aw girl your face is, sayin why

Can't believe the words to her I just said
But who the hell argue 'n' fight
Like dogs at 6 in the morning? (in the mornin)
I know it's gonna be some more shit tonight
Our pastor's callin', tellin' me
I done went too far in
I'm seen around town
And my friends can't recognize me
'Cuz I took a chance on love (love)
It's like (like)

For you I gave my heart

And turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama
I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man
That I never thought I'd be.
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers

I done took all I can take
But you leave me no options girl
I can't deny how much I love you
I done gave up errthing I had to
As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say

Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
listen to the people screaming out more, and more
Cos I create the feeling that keep em coming back,
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep em coming back,
So captivating when I get it on the floor
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it,
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that Monster in the mirror,
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder,
if you on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

If you really want more, scream it out louder,
if you on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,

Yeah, ay, yo
2000, it's us
Yo, it's time to U-Turn
Ya heard me?
You're either with us or against us, yo

It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball

Remember, the snake and how the floor used to clear
And everybody would break
What's crunk now, used to be called getting to it
We're bringing it all back, this is how we do it, just

Put your hands up
Bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle
Get down with me

Oh, come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn

Put your hands up
Bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle
Get down with me

Oh, come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn

In the 80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the 90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok

I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown, the dance was the running man

When I think about your lovin', the Sunday evenings
The fun we use to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over only set aside

Oh it's you Sweet Baby
I will never be free from your embrace, Sweet Baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you Sweet Baby
Ever lost and captured by your smile, Sweet Baby

Usher (yeah, man)

So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from side to side
Si-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life
Back-back to life
Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance, like it's the last
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Keep downing drinks like this
Hope tomorrow that's just right now, now, now
Now, n-now, now
Gonna set the roof on fire

Yeah
Usher, baby
This is for the A

Shawty, I don't mind If you dance on a pole
That don't make you a hoe
Shawty, I don't mind when you work until three
If you're leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes

Long as you coming home, girl, I don't mind

The ballers in here tonight, they gon' buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon' make it colossal in here
Cause shawty you thinkin' them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?

I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Shawty, I don't mind If you dance on a pole
That don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind when you work until three

You make sure that Im alright

No matter what I cant believe you deal with me

Even when I put you down, how can you keep giving?
When I disappoint you
You dont deserve it but why do you take it?
Cause you say Im worth it

You're doin' the most
(Show me, baby)
I wanna learn

To understand

How to love and please you
(Yeah)
Like you do every time I need you

Uh, uh huh
Gangster

(Verse 1)
I though it was love
Didn't wanna admit that
When I looked back
It was lust
Too bad I had to learn a lesson
They were against me
You were with me
But you never let your old thang go
I don't care to know why
Girl I guess some things
Can't be explained

(Chorus)
It is what it is (what it is)
I don't know what to call it
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)

It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (uh huh)
When it's really something else

(Verse 2)
Know that is okay
Felt something going on
For every time that I fought it (uh)
Girl I bet that's what it was
Called myself being down for you (ice cold)
Just know that
Even if I already knew you
I already knew how you get down (uh)
But if that's your thang, babe
I ain't mad at you
It's cool
Just know I did it too

You know what we do
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let's get it {ha!}
Let's get it
Let's get it {ha}

(Verse 1)
I pull up at the light and see you looking my way {ho!}
I lay back in my seat and think of some pimp shit to say
It's been a while since one look
Made me feel this way
And I don't intend to let you go, no {come on, come on}

(Bridge)
And baby I can't wait (I can't wait)
To show you all around the world {say what, say what huh huh}
Oh girl oh girl {so put it in the water!}
I got what what you need (oh)

(Chorus)
Baby I can give you everything you need (every-thing that you need) {huh huh huh yeah}
Just trust your man and let me do me (let me do me baby)
I wanna take you places you only see on TV (oh oh oh girl)

Make every minute worth it, baby
This for Usher, baby (watch this)

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin' that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

It's 5 in the mornin'
Kush is rollin' while she's makin' steak and eggs
At 5 in the mornin'
We can only be about to do one thing (what?)

See, I told her
The devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

I think that she's a winner
She could be a keeper

'Cause she's such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
She's such a good kisser
I'ma rain on this parade
Oh baby
