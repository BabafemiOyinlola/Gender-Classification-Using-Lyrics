Let's work it out, let's try to make it happen
Don't do the things that other guys did to hurt me
They make me cry, break my heart, oh why?

I know you're a busy man
But you don't understand, how it feels to be alone
When times get hard and I wanna feel
Your sweet and tender touch
That's all I'm askin' baby
'Cause I never asked for much, oh

Sometimes it's hard for us to get along
But I miss him when he's not home

But I'm a make the best with what I have
Reminiscing on when we touch

This is another one of those heartbreak hotel joints for the ladies

Why won't you grow up and be a man someday?
I can't believe that you're still playin' silly games
Now why do I put up with all this child's play?
Now if your word is all you have then you ain't worth a damn thing

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me, I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

You're the worst, I can't even depend on you
You say a lot of good things but somethin' else you always do
Be a man of your word, try to love something other than you
But now you can be on your way 'cause I don't want you to stay

Promises, promises 'bout our house, 'bout the kids

Life has a way of making you live it.
Sometimes it takes you to giving it.
Do you fold or do you play on?
The next move always depends on you.
If your work is good then it's trouble at home.
If your moves is right.
Then your dough is tight.
It's like running a engine on no fuel.
How do you play in a game with no rules?

[B-Sect:]
(It's always a fight).
A constant battle in my mind. (No place to run, no were to hide).
I gotta keep moving on, I gotta at least try...
(Dealing with the pressures of everyday life).
Gotta go the extra mile just can't throw in the towel.
You would be so amazed by the things that I can tell...

Making it threw but tryin' to figure it out.
Tryin' to stay right when the world is so wrong.

You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want,
Is for you to fall apart.
Your future will get clearer,
I want you to remember.

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
And each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams

Lovers and friends? til the end, what it? s got us in
Never would? ve thought it was you that would choose me
Now I'm on a flight, ain? t afraid of heights
I can breathe right, exhale,? cause you did something to me

When you made me feel loved, really made me give up
When I didn't see much, when I felt your touch
What a man say once in the first 12 months
I ain? t heard in my life from the closest one

There's so much I knew, too good to be true
When it came so fast, what's a girl to do?
Never will I say when a man won't change
? Cause you changed my life and I'm so damn happy baby

Know, when You Know, You Know, you kn-know

From the very first time back when I met you at school
I looked in your eyes saw something special in you
We inspire the we
We'll be american dream
Escape this reality come start a new one with me
We could be neighbourhood royalty
Or much more than that u'll see
We're makin history
We'll go to the mass
Fly to heaven and back
The highest heights imagine
Yes we can do all of that baby

Lalalalalalalalalalalaaa we could be king and queen someday
Lalalalalalalalalalalaaa we'll never throw our dreams away

So tired, tired of this drama
You go your way, I go my way
No more, no more
I wanna be free
I'm so tired, so tired

Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
'Cause I can guarantee
That I'll be fine

(No more pain), no more pain
(No more pain), no more pain
(No drama), no more drama in my life
No one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress

We are lovers through and through and though
We made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on

I've been searchin' for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

Ooh, when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one

So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations

I must confess the best
Love that I've ever had
And I just gotta let you know this

Don't let 'em tell you nothing different

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go

We didn't build nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real sh (yes)

See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)

Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it

Yo, what up, this Wyclef with Mary J.
I serenade the girls with my accoustic guitar
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, fellas havin' problems with the chicks?
I want you right now to turn the lights down low
Pull your girl up next to you
I want you to sing this to her

If death comes for me tonight, girl
I want you to know that I love you
And no matter how tough I wouldn't dare
Only to you I would reveal my tears
So tell the police I ain't home tonight
Messin' around with you is gonna get me life
But when I look into your eyes
You're worth that sacrafice
If this is the kind of love that my mom used to warn me about
Man, I'm in trouble
I'm in real big trouble
If this is the kind of love that the old folks used to warn me about
Man, I'm in trouble

I need y'all to do me a favor

While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass long time ago

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time

'Cause you're not worth my tears
Can't do it
I said I can't do it
You were never worth my tears
Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week

Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side

How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know?
When it's time, time to let go
Sing

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I ask for a sign from the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you and you for me

Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
If I give you one more try to these rules, will you abide?
And if I mean anything to you, would it make everything all right?

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Mhm

'91 I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?" things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life
And my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you

And told you what I been through

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere, but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stops

Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere, but you already know me

Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the "Mary" album
And people were saying that
It's just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love

So now my love to you baby I surrender

And there is nothing in this world to come between me and you

And now that I'm here no one can ever erase
The joy that I feel way down deep beside
The love that I have for me will never, never die

I can see in color the first sign of spring
The rose buds are blooming
I got a new song, new song to sing

Life looks so amazing

And for the very, very first time I can see in color

Everything looks beautiful, sky so baby blue

Fantastic all my fears

Fantastic come to me
Fantastic now i am
Fantastic someone watching over me fantastic

I dreamt that i could paint you with words
But there were no colors bright enough
Black or white enough
Blue or green enough, it didn't mean enough
You are the star that touched the earth
Shine bright for all eyes to see
Radiate and touched me
Now i'm shining like you do
It was dim before i knew you

Bright light for weeping eyes to get used to
Trust who, that's some shit to adjust to
Soon as you relax, they ease back and cold bust you
Love murdered in brooklyn, sound the alarm
But you still remain calm, my passion is unarmed
I tried to practice my whole life tactics
But in your clutch and your touch, my armor just collapses
Sun's bliss breeds obliviousness
So recollect sweet breath still wet on my lips
My prayer's this: go protect my beloved and keep her covered
>from the valley to the summer like the land undiscovered
(like the stars)

Beautiful, now you're near in my life all my fear

It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh

I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my sweet. How have you been?
Your so nice but tonight we're gonna be more than just friends
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Dont you feel the magic, the mystery's in the air
Lets go down to lover's lane with the love we shared

We are lovers through and through and though
We made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on

I've been searchin' for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

Ooh, when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one

So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations

Knowing you would play with my heart
But that was so long ago that I thought
We could make a new start

You left me broken hearted
From the day your love departed
Now that love you found
With someone new is gone
And so you wanna come back

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?

Yeah
Lets take em back
Uh huh
'91 I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?"
Things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame
Comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music still sincere
Let's get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
In '94 was "My Life"
And my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you

And told you what I been through
Hate or love it
The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

Hate or love it

The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin' to find my way
Then I dropped the "Mary" album
And people would say that
It's just not gonna work

And my feelings they did hurt

But my fans showed me so much love

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real sh** (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)

Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

There come a time in your life when
You love something, you have to let it go
And even though you might feel there's still something there
You have to wake up, stop livin' in a dream
'Cause it's over now, you got to think about you

I have always wondered, why?
Why I can't live without you babe and I'm longing to be your lady
I understand that you are leaving
Please don't leave here without me baby
'Cause I think I might go insane

'Cause everybody needs someone to love
And I know that it's true, and I know that it's you
I don't understand, why you can't be my man
So I better wake up, stop living in a dream
Yes, I better wake up 'cause I can't lose the love I never had
So I better wake up, as painful as it seems
Yes I better wake up, I can not lose the love I never had

Every time I close my eyes I see visions of you and I
Sharing love of a special kind, oh
I got to laugh to keep from crying, yeah

I don't ask for too many things
Only one thing I really need
That is you, baby, next to me
With that I'm satisfied

Don't need diamonds, I don't need gold
I just need someone here to hold
To keep me warm when the nights are cold
That would do just fine, just fine

You don't have to promise me the stars
Just promise me love inside your heart
And that's enough
Baby, that's enough

(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all of you
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need

(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all the love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time
(All your heart)
All your soul, baby, that's enough
Nothing else that I need

Give me you, give me you
That's enough for me, baby

I'm surprised to see your suitcase at the door
Remember the good times, don't you want some more
It's not a perfect love, but I'll defend it
Cause I believe that's what God intended

{1} - We got love too good to throw away

{2} - It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free

{3} - What has been joined by God, by God
Let no man put asunder
Oh no don't throw it away
Don't throw it away

I can hear those words spoken, understood
Making bonds through love, the times are better good
I'm convinced that what is meant to be will be
Even the stars declare that you belong to me

I've been searching for someone
But never looked before my eyes
There you were to my surprise
It was so obvious looking into your face
After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place
I never thought that I
Would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed
I knew it had to be you
I never thought that we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do

Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away
Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back
I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
But Sunday we made love
Now what are we gonna do

To be with you

In my dreams I take you by the hand
In our house on the beach
Making love on jet black sand

Baby finally the time

So come on, talk to me

Ain't no telling lies, ain't no holding back
Ain't no tip toeing, we too grown for that
I'm gonna say some things and I'm very clear
That you may say some things I may not wanna hear

But I'm gon' listen to them and we gon' work it out

Babe, every since we've been together it's been great.
And I can really see myself with you forever.
I said hey, I'm pretty much ok.
But I still must say if we gone stay solid then...
Hey, there's a few little things that I've
been meaning to bring to your attention partner.

If you love me like you say you do...
(Hold me, show me, act like I'm really the one)
Aw, babe if you love me like you say you do...
(Kiss me, fix me up like I'm all that you got)
Yeah, you like to...
(Tell me)
(If you're nervous, that's alright)
(I'd rather see)
In your actions cause...
(They don't lie)
So if you love me like you say you do...
(Then you really hear me)
Ohhh...
(Feel me)

Now for the past 3 weeks you've been dipping, slipping, running round.
Through the city.
Through the town.

Maybe it'll rain today
And I won't have to leave my room
Givin' me the time
I need to get rid of your things
Enough procrastinating
For reasons that only I know
But I'm afraid to ask the mirror
The answers may sting


And the smoke
In my eyes makes it hard not to cry
Why you gone?
The reason is suppose to make sense
But it don't


Give me something
To spark the flame
Take away the paint
Take it away
I can feel the heat
From my face


Ooh
Holding on isn't healthy
But it's killin' me

This is how these things go
I was broke
And you were scared
But you stayed by my side, yea

I was yours
You were mine
It seemed we'd last forever, oh yea
I'd be the one you need
You would be the one I marry
And I'm just trying to invite my way back in your heart
And I'm telling you to...

Come to me
I'll restore freedom
I'll carve away the waters in your heart

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day

As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past but that I mustn't fear

So I better wake up, as painful as it seems

I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my sweet. How have you been?
Your so nice but tonight we're gonna be more than just friends
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Dont you feel the magic, the mystery's in the air
Lets go down to lover's lane with the love we shared

(Chorus)
Let's make the time tonight while the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had
Let's make the time tonight while the feelings right

I will love you anyway
Even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you want to be

I just want to satisfy you
'Cause you're not mine and I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talkin', baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

Whoa, sweet thing
Don't ya know you're my everything
Whoa, sweet thing
Don't ya know you're my everything, yes, you are

I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
Love you child my whole life long
It's been right or been wrong

I'm only what ya make me, baby
Don't walk away, don't be so shady
Don't want your mind, don't want your money
These words I say they may sound funny, but

Whoa, sweet thing

Baby, not tonight
I don't wanna fuss and fight
I just wanna make it right
There's work to do
I wanna get real close to you
I wanna get you in the mood

All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you every day
And I know that you love me, baby admit it

Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top
(All night long)
Come into my bedroom honey
What I got will make you spend money
(All night long)

You know that I know that you love me

Baby, there's no need to tell ya, as far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you so you don't have to worry at all
I'll sacrifice my time, I'll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I'll bring, I wanna give you all of my love

Said I'm loving you, loving you every day

Don't you look no more, love without a limit
(Love without a limit)
Said I'm loving you, loving you every day
(I'm loving you, boy)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know

Ooh baby, I'm in need of your love and you got that touch
That I need so much and I am about to explode
Freely, completely, everything you want I'll be
Good love down to the last drop and I'm not gonna stop
No, no, no, no, no

Said I'm loving you, loving you every day
Don't you look no more, love without a limit

'Cause I'll always be your friend

I gave my heart to you
What more can I do to show you how much I care
About you and all the little things you do
But see, all I ask is that you make me feel like I'm somebody
All day, all day, everyday, give your lovin' away, whoa

Baby, can't you see if we should part

While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass long time ago

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time

'Cause you're not worth my tears
Can't do it
I said I can't do it
You were never worth my tears
Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week

Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side

Nodding my head just moving
My girlfriend dragged me to this place
Staring in the crowd like we do
I saw this guy through the people
And that's when I saw you face
But you came over to me
As sweet can be
And left my left hand
Started stepping
What else did I need to know
I said yes if you wanted to go
Cause you are heaven
But you left me here

So I gotta see that boy again
Cause I wanna feel that joy again
I remember leaning on his shoulder
Something cooler
What are you ordering
That's why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again

Making truth is all I desire
Seen enough to know I've seen too much

Words can't save us
Sometimes you got to kiss and make up
We argue
But it won't break us
Put some make-up, babies
Just so you can kiss and make up
It's safe for everybody
It's safe for everybody, everybody
I wanna kiss and make up
Go on, kiss and make up

Put some make-up, babies
Just so you can kiss and make up

to think something differnt's coming 'cross that track

sometimes i feel so lost
but they say love is blind
sometimes i need you here to
to help me face my fears
standing in this fire
seduced by the flames
why can't you be my joy
and also be my pain

Some nights i wish i didn't love ya
some days i wish i didn't care
sometimes i just hold on
can't stand the idea
of sleeping by myself

Would I brought me a brand new heart

I might have to plead insanity
‘Cause everything in me is telling me to go

Cause I can't keep on crying when I see ya
Messing up my make up
Thinking you gon' change
But everything's the same
Starting keeping secrets
Got my heart in pieces
I'mma ‘bout to pick myself up, and go

You gon' wake up in the morn
And find out that I'm already gone
Got a one way ticket, here's your goodbye song
And while you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
While you're trying to explain

So if you're looking for the ratchetness
Don't look my way

Baby imma love you
But you ain't gotta love me Back
I'll do everything i say i do for you
to show my love just can't be matched

So when your out late night blowing other bills
The most you do that bs the more i keep it real
Go ahead and lose yourself ima stay attached
It's one thing in respect is when we dont react
thats that power back

He used to stay gone now he's coming home
Thats that power back
And when i stop calling he's on my phone
That's that power back

let me tell you about a love that you don't have
yeah.
Love will tell us that it's good when it's all bad.

And Love will tell us we are cool, when we not cool.
And love can call you a fool but that be rude.

Love like that,
love likes that sometimes.
Don't you stress, don't even you strain your mind.
Love likes that,
Love likes that sometimes.
It's seems so bad, when you got a good love that's hard to find

Would it be better to creep in pounds of gold.
Would it seems better if roses can't grow
Would it feels better if it's never cold.
Loves like the california sun, when it's ready to rain we just ain't know.

Would we be better if we shop at the dollar store.
Would it be better to take less when we can have more.

Better is what the world deserves
Why's humanity just another world?
Hey, you need me, I need you
To give me a hand, it's never too soon
We say we wanna change, we say we wanna grow
But all we do is destroy, leavin' no room for love
We spend all day talkin'
We spend all night layin' the dream out
But we never wake up to this vision of peace
Between you and between me
We're just sleep walkin', we're just sleep walkin'

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

When I found out that you were leaving me
I couldn't sleep thinking about
All the things that we've been through
Now all that I want to do is tell you that I miss you so much

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

All those pretty memories

Common Feat. Mary J Blige - "Come Close"

(verse 1) {Common}
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know you're sick and tired of arguing,
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we gotta swallow it.
Your heart and mind, Baby, follow it
Smile, happiness, you can model it
and when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm 'a do the best I can do
'Cuz I'm the best when I'm with you

(Chorus) {Mary J. Blige}
Come close to me, Baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world gets crazy
What's it without you? (nothing nothing)

[Prodigy]
First of all we the one and only
Infamous and Mary Blige
Coming straight, ghetto poetry
And ain't nothing changed but the size of the money
I'm still that same 'g'
Can you say the same thing?
[Havoc]
Must be blind to the fact Mary Queen on the wax
We the kings on the streets
Ain't know where your heart at, look inside
And you'll find a entertainer, one of a kind
That's way ahead of her time
Take a look
[Mary]
Oh I need to know
If you can get into my mind
Stimulate it
Give me good love all the time
Or are you just another man
Who's after me for all my paper
Looking for a ride that's free
[1 - Mary]
Deep inside I wish you'd see
That I'm just plain old Mary

Back before
The record deal
And the cars
And the cribs
And the way

Took off

At Lucy's
On 1-25th
Just tryin'
My best
To get on
Back when
Me and Puff
And B.I.G.
Was kids
And I knew
Jodeci
I was young
And tough
And fresh in love
And it was
All a dream
Signing a contract
No guiding light
Just hopin' I
I can get out
The projects
And get my
Family right
'Cause they
Were my life
In Red Zones
In Bentley's
You can
Catch me

Never would? ve thought it was you that would choose me
Now I'm on a flight, ain? t afraid of heights
I can breathe right, exhale,? cause you did something to me

When you made me feel loved, really made me give up
When I didn't see much, when I felt your touch
What a man say once in the first 12 months
I ain? t heard in my life from the closest one

There's so much I knew, too good to be true

Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me

That I'll be fine

Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time

Pull your girl up next to you, I want you to sing this to her

If death comes for me tonight, girl
I want you to know that I love you
And no matter how tough I wouldn't dare
Only to you I would reveal my tears
So tell the police I ain't home tonight
Messin' around with you is gonna get me life
But when I look into your eyes, you're worth that sacrifice

If this is the kind of love that my mom used to warn me about
Man, I'm in trouble, I'm in real big trouble

All I really want

You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you and you for me

That I'll be lovin' you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day

As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past but that I mustn't fear

Yeah
Lets take em back
Uh huh
'91 I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?"
Things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame
Comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music still sincere
Let's get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
In '94 was "My Life"
And my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you

And told you what I been through
Hate or love it
The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

Hate or love it

The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin' to find my way
Then I dropped the "Mary" album
And people would say that
It's just not gonna work

And my feelings they did hurt

But my fans showed me so much love

And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say 'we'?
I never would've made it, baby
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could've given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't think so!
I would've bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you've beat me at my own game

I know I do some things
That make you so confused
One minute, I'm so in love
And the next, I can't stand you

But if you may ask
It's just the things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess
That I've been through

I got this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someones done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

Heartache and pain
I just can't do it again
So I look for the worst
And brace myself for the hurt

But nobody has ever
Treated me this way
Please be patient with me
'Coz I want you to stay

Time on my hands
Since you've been away boy
I ain't got no plans (no, no, no, no)
and the sound of the rain against my window pane
Is slowly, is slowly driving me insane, boy

Chorus:

I'm goin' down
I'm goin down
Cause you ain't around baby
My whole world's upside down

Sleep don't come easy
Boy please believe me

Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here

I wanna make you happy

I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...

I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing

To give him all of me
If I'm twisted, if I'm sober
Oh yeah
Because his kisses
Seem to start

A chain reaction

You gotta see it
To believe it
You gotta feel
And when you feel it
You know it's real
It's something different
Something crazy happens

You excite a nigger till you got me feeling niced up
Everything about it feels amazing, spiced up
Hot and steamy like my mother cooked a little white soup
See that 20 karats, please get a priced up
I'm past that girlfriend shit, baby, wifed up
Elevated feeling like we going couple flights up
Next level, with a hope you ain't afraid of height, what
Skyscrapers take it higher, even got a helicopter on the roof
Waiting for a small fire and then flee to the spot
And let us ride up to heavens to the next level
Let me do my part
It feels like your hands were designed to be on my body
You best believe that and I agree with you too
Like I was made to be your girl, yeah
And you already know
That's why I won't give my time to just anybody
You know I'm with your baby
'Cause my time's your time, my world's your world
So if it's cool with you
I'ma tell my girls go out tonight, without me
Nothing's to do with you, let's bring the party to the house tonight
'Cause tonight I'm ready, yeah
I'd rather be with my, baby

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom

On the east or the west coast
Every area code, all over the globe
Ain't no way on the planet you can go that I won't

From sun up to sun down

Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

Cause I got days and days of love, for you boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
Cause I got so much love for you boy

Don't it seem like, like I'm always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time, a terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working made me an addict
Theres way more people that want it than people that have it
I dont get it, I would hate to think I tricked 'em
They fall victim to my system, guess I sure know how to pick 'em
And I'm always her regret, yeah, I'm always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever's coming next
It goes up and down, it's just up and down
She's crying now but she'll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
In expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she's not the type to hold grudges
I'm wrong.
Bad boys aint no good
Good boys aint no fun

We both said that things will change
But it's still the same shade of gray
I get mad you walk away
When it all just start to fade
I know you're fed up so am I
But we just can't say goodbye
Boy, you know I love
But I just can't go on no more

But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
And you need to know

A woman
She needs more than material things

Needs so much more than what I make her say

A woman
Needs you to make love to her, she needs more than sex
Oh, a real woman needs a real man
They don't talk about it, be about it
Put that work, and still shows his woman real romance

While I was begging God for you to love me

But instead, you put a pillow over your head

Brings you closer to your dreams

Life looks so amazing
I never knew that it could open my eyes
And for the very, very first time I can see in color

Everything looks beautiful, sky so baby blue

Woohoohoo, whooohooohoo,
Whoohoo, whoohohohohoo

There something that I want to say
But I feel I don't know how
And so I just can't hold it one more day
So I think I'll let it out
You're on my mind more than I may show
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
You're future will get clearer
I want you to remember
With each tear, there's a lesson
(There's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before(wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know(stronger)
With each tear, brings you closer to your dream
No mistake, no heart break

Seems like we were right
But you always have a problem with everything
Appreciate your advise but sometimes I have trouble managing
Now that I'm paying attention I see how beautiful you are
But when you spend so much time together now everything can get so dark

Oh when you're gone
I'd miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home

When you're gone
I'd miss you like you took a piece of me with you
Didn't think I'd care that much, did ya?
Just tell me when you're coming home

Now if your word is all you have, then you ain't worth a damn thing

You told me everyday (that you made)
You never ever came (not for me)
I really want to believe (but not today)
Not today, not today, not today

You're the worst, I can't even depend on you
You say a lot of good things, but somethin' else you always do

But now you can be on your way, because I don't want you today

Bought a house, bought the kids

And she's buying
A stairway to heaven
When she gets there, she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get
What she came for
And she's buying
A stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know, sometimes
Words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts
Are misgivings
Ooh, and it makes me wonder
Ooh, and it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying
For leaving

If your moves is right.
Then your dough is tight.
It's like running a engine on no fuel.
How do you play in a game with no rules?

A constant battle in my mind. (No place to run, no were to hide).

Gotta go the extra mile just can't throw in the towel.

Boy, than I am, than I am

When you're out at night and you're in the streets
And you have time to yourself
Think of all the love that you get from me
That you can't find nowhere else

When you're far away and I'm not around
And temptation fills your heart
Think of all the ways that I'm faithful, babe
And to replace me would be hard, 'cause there's nobody

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better

Why would I spend the rest of my days unhappy
Why would I spend the rest of this year alone
When I can go therapy

When I can go therapy two times a day
Why would I spend the rest of this week so bitter
And all that listening is making you bitter too
When I can go therapy

Most nights I lie awake between you and Fall

But you always have a problem with everything
Appreciate your advise but sometimes I have trouble managing
Now that I'm paying attention I see how beautiful you are
But when you spend so much time together now everything can get so dark

Oh when you're gone
I'd miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home

Didn't think I'd care that much, did ya?

I can be the girl you like, the one in your dreams
I'll be the one you desire

I'm not saying you go crazy, chasing everybody down
I'm just playing 'cause I know that I'm the best loving around
I'm in heaven every time you lay your body next to me
You're in heaven, you keep coming back 'cause now you're in too deep

Nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing as good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving

Nothing brings the fire

Well, well
You're my true fantasy
My daily covenant
I swear I would never bring you harm

Just because you think we're lost don't make it true
I know ain't no rules to this game
I'm not gonna give up what we do
Every time you go searching for pain
Take a long hard look

Grass is never greener on the other side
Every revolution turns a page
Take a long hard look
It ain't ever greener on the other side
Every resolution makes a change
Take a long hard look at yourself
Look at yourself

Baby look at us now

But I really can't let you inside
Bad, how deep the pain is
Or you just couldn't believe
And yes I'm good on the surface
But I'm a mess, I'm a mess underneath
See winter took most of my heart
And Spring punched right in the stomach
Summer came looking for blood
And by autumn, I was left with nothing

It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been about five years
Gon' take a long long year for me to trust somebody

Into your arms to a place
Where I know that I'm gonna stay, gonna stay

That you left me with on that day, on that day

And the kids on the streets
Said you're getting it from me
You think you can kick the sand in my eyes,
but you should walk a little softer
I hear you coming from a mile away
and you don't have enough to offer!

Or you'll regret it

You won't forget it

You just follow, follow, follow

And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day

As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past but that I mustn't fear

But since the day we kissed
I knew it had to be you
I never thought that we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do

Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away
Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back
I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
But Sunday we made love
Now what are we gonna do

(Listen, Listen)

And it's on and it's on
And it's on and it's on
And it's on tonight
It's about time that we met
And it's about time a love I won't forget

And it's on and it's on
And it's on and it's on
And it's on tonight
It's about time that we met
And it's about time a love I won't forget

For so long I've waited for the chance
To be with you
And to lie with you baby
In my dreams I take you by the hand
In our house on the beach
Making love on jet black sand

Baby finally the time
Has come for us to share
The joy that we will need
And nothing can compare

And it's on and it's on
And it's on and it's on
And it's on tonight
It's about time that we met

While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass long time ago

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time

'Cause you're not worth my tears
Can't do it
I said I can't do it
You were never worth my tears
Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week

Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side

I wanna make you happy

I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib

You excite a nigger till you got me feeling niced up
Everything about it feels amazing, spiced up
Hot and steamy like my mother cooked a little white soup
See that 20 karats, please get a priced up
I'm past that girlfriend shit, baby, wifed up
Elevated feeling like we going couple flights up
Next level, with a hope you ain't afraid of height, what
Skyscrapers take it higher, even got a helicopter on the roof
Waiting for a small fire and then flee to the spot
And let us ride up to heavens to the next level
Let me do my part
It feels like your hands were designed to be on my body
You best believe that and I agree with you too
Like I was made to be your girl, yeah
And you already know
That's why I won't give my time to just anybody
You know I'm with your baby
'Cause my time's your time, my world's your world

Nothing's to do with you, let's bring the party to the house tonight

But missing most of the other time, a terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working made me an addict
Theres way more people that want it than people that have it
I dont get it, I would hate to think I tricked 'em
They fall victim to my system, guess I sure know how to pick 'em
And I'm always her regret, yeah, I'm always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever's coming next
It goes up and down, it's just up and down
She's crying now but she'll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
In expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she's not the type to hold grudges
I'm wrong.

Good boys aint no fun

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real sh** (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

It's funny right? They say things done change
No more messages in the music, record sales down, gas prices up
No more love in your love, no more love for your love
Change is long overdue, Mary, something's gotta give, Big Boi

You can trot around the planet or watch it on the news
Sombody's getting shot, the weather man's looking confused
He's reporting to a nation full of zombies strung out on starbucks
And stitched up and bitching Abercrombie

Uh, don't get it mixed up me too
I have insomnia at times but don't be walkin' 'round here blind
Nigga feelin' all around, trying to find a righteous path
It's appealin' when I rhyme

So everytime I hit the masses, you know the common folk
Blue collared day to day workers
That squeeze a dollar so they baby can swallow
A little not a lota just enough to fill that bottle

But it's a million dollars a gallon for some gas to get to work
Tomorrow that's if you gotta get it, you can't swim in carpool
You Rob Peter to pay Paul to make due
Make you wanna write a note and take a pistol to that bank too
And pass it to the teller but you know better

They trying to tell us to stay strong
But every day we losing jobs
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Somethin's gonna have to give

Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
Somethin's gonna have to give

The great debators debate about who's the greatest MC
Subject matter don't matter because the verse is empty
No food for thought nothing for the brain to digest
So I guess it'd be about who can bullshit the best

But I give them light on like the traffic I direct
Inspiring their life like they was actors on my set

So my baby ain't no way that I'ma let go
From the north to the south pole
On the east or the west coast
Every area code, all over the globe
Ain't no way on the planet you can go that I won't

From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around,
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

Cause I got days and days of love, for you boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
Cause I got so much love for you boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8, 25/8

To throw back at you when it benefits him
So he can go and play with all his chickens

From my life others shall learn a lesson
Want a leader with the world on my shoulder

Living up to everyone's expectations
Condemned me to a world of damnation
I gotta clear these voices from my head
All these opinionated noises

Listen to the voice of my creator
Opens doors to a path much greater

I go my way
(No more, no more, no more)
I need to be free
Ohhh...
So tired, tired, tired of all this drama

Broken heart again
Another lesson learned
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee
That I'll be fine
(I'll be fine)

No more pain
(no more pain)
No more pain
(no more pain)
No drama
No more drama in my life
(no more in my life)
No one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

No more pain
(no more pain, no more pain)
No more games
(no more games messin with my mind)
No drama
No more drama in my life
(No more in my life)
No one's gonna make me hurt again
No more
(no more tears)

My everything, everything, everything
You are my everything, you are my everything
You, my everything

It's all because of you
I'm never sad and blue
You brighten up my day
In your own special way
Whenever you're around
I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend
On you I can depend

You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And then on a cloudy day, you brought sunshine into my life
It never occurred to me, the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced
You are my (you are) everything (you are my everything)
Love so good (love so good, so good, so good, so good) only you can bring
You are my (you are my) everything
You are everything, and everything is you

My darling, only you can make my dreams come true

Remember the good times, don't you want some more
It's not a perfect love, but I'll defend it
Cause I believe that's what God intended

It's not over, don't want to be free

Let no man put asunder
Oh no don't throw it away

Making bonds through love, the times are better good

Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Oh, yes, it did, yeah
Before love like this, you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save yah
Oh, please hold on, it'll save yah, save yah

Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm paying for it, I'm changin' for it
Oh, oh, and it hurts
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
I'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose

Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds are movin' past you

Oh, you gotta love yourself
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day

As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past but that I mustn't fear

My everything, everything, everything
You are my everything, you are my everything

In your own special way
Whenever you're around

On you I can depend

You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when on a cloudy days, you brought sunshine in my life

and will always be together. (Our Love)

While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass long time ago

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time

'Cause you're not worth my tears
Can't do it
I said I can't do it
You were never worth my tears
Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week

Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side

Boy you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
And you need to know

I try my best to keep you here
But it's hard to hold a shadow
You said goodbye but I couldn't hear
Too busy praying for a miracle

And you left me on my knees
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency to intervene
While I was begging God for you to love me

I prayed about us every night, mhmm
Boy I know you had to hear me
You could have stopped me then and told the truth
But instead, you put a pillow over your head

There's no way to change it
No way to make it make sense
And it's lonely there

Well, honey, don't I understand

You need someone to love you
You need someone to hold you
Tonight
Someone to love you
Someone to love you

It's gonna be a long, long journey
It's gonna be an uphill climb
It's gonna be a tough fight
It's gonna be some lonely nights
But I'm ready to carry on

I'm so glad the worst is over
('Cause it almost took me down)
I can start living now
I feel like I can do anything, yeah
And finally I'm not afraid to breathe

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can't deny the truth
'Cause I'm the living proof

So many don't survive
They just don't make it through
But look at me
I'm the living proof, oh yes, I am

In my life
I've seen
It all
Now it's time
For me
To pass
On this
Knowledge to you
All my sisters
My troubled sisters
This is my
Gift to you

[1st Verse:]
Been many days
Couldn't take
The pain
Felt like
I should take
My life away
See it everyday
In every other
Young sisters face
(Young sister, sister)
See'em cryin' out
Life full of doubt
Runnin' in the streets
No self esteem
Thinkin' that
Use to be me
What a shame

[B-Sect:]
And life
Is a mutha
It's hard
To sit back
And see
The same thing
Happen to me
Happen to you
This ain't love
But here's
The love
I wanna give to you

[Chorus:]
It dosen't
Matter what
They say or do
Don't let'em
Get to you
Don't be afraid

She's been down and out
She's been wrote about
She's been talked about constantly
She's been up and down
She's been pushed around
But they held her down, NYC
She has no regrets
She accepts the past
All these things they
Helped make to make she
She's been lost and found
And she's still around
There's a reason for everything

You know I've been holdin' on
Try to make me weak
But I still stay strong
Put my life all up in these songs
Just so you can feel me
So you can get the real me

So take me as I am (take me as I am)
Or have nothing at all (nothing at all)
Just take me as I am
Or have nothing at all (at all)

One minute, I'm so in love
And the next, I can't stand you

But if you may ask
It's just the things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess
That I've been through

I got this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someones done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

Heartache and pain

So I look for the worst
And brace myself for the hurt

But nobody has ever
Treated me this way

Yeah
Lets take em back
Uh huh
'91 I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?"
Things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame
Comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music still sincere
Let's get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
In '94 was "My Life"
And my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you

And told you what I been through
Hate or love it
The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

Hate or love it

The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin' to find my way
Then I dropped the "Mary" album
And people would say that
It's just not gonna work

And my feelings they did hurt

But my fans showed me so much love

to turn my gray skies blue,

(It's not all about the money)
It's not all about the money
('Cause I love what I'm doin' for the people)
I really love doin' my job, I really do
 (Don't know were I would be if this didn't happened)
You know
(But I finally made it)

A lot of us don't graduate from high school
A lot us don't get a shot at being a superstar
A lot us don't get a chance to fulfill our dreams
But I'm thinking like, "God, if I wasn't doing this
What would I be doing?"

Probably like braiding hair

In the middle of the night, you hold me tight
Said, "It's alright, I'm yours forever"
I'll do what you want, if you don't hurt me
I'll cook and clean, I'll make you happy
And

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
And ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you

Got a chills in my bones, and it's all for you babe
Can't leave you alone, I'm so addicted
I can't sanctify, it's the sweetest pain
So who's your girl?
You better say my name

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything

This is simple, I know you understand
Another man can't quite love you girl like I can
Your fantasies and your dreams, believe in me, I will fufill
Now you know how I feel
Now baby, tell me how do you feel?

Boy I feel like this just can't be real
And if I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up
So what's the deal? Should I save my love for you?
'Cause no one way makes me feel the way that you do

You make me wanna see your face everyday
(Mm, mm)
Deep down inside I know that your my soul mate
(You are my soul mate)
If you should be my man, patiently
(Oh I know me)
'Cause boy I know that your the one for me

Let me be the one to give you everything

Let me be the one that's always in your dreams

[1st Verse:]
Life has a way of making you live it.
Sometimes it takes you to giving it.
Do you fold or do you play on?
The next move always depends on you.
If your work is good then it's trouble at home.
If your moves is right.
Then your dough is tight.
It's like running a engine on no fuel.
How do you play in a game with no rules?

[B-Sect:]
(It's always a fight).
A constant battle in my mind. (No place to run, no were to hide).
I gotta keep moving on, I gotta at least try...
(Dealing with the pressures of everyday life).
Gotta go the extra mile just can't throw in the towel.
You would be so amazed by the things that I can tell...

[Hook:]
I got troubles with in, troubles with out.
Making it threw but tryin' to figure it out.
Tryin' to stay right when the world is so wrong.

To all the women, all over the world
That have to still deal with this issue
You know I've been there too I had to deal with it with you
But come on now ladies how many times he got to say
Her name? Listen

You came home late last night
You smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself this man has no respect for me
I knew it all along 'coz you were talking in your sleep

It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that?
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby

It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here?
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you

I said, baby girl, lighting up the room like the light's up
You excite a nigger till you got me feeling niced up
Everything about it feels amazing, spiced up
Hot and steamy like my mother cooked a little white soup
See that 20 karats, please get a priced up
I'm past that girlfriend shit, baby, wifed up
Elevated feeling like we going couple flights up
Next level, with a hope you ain't afraid of height, what
Skyscrapers take it higher, even got a helicopter on the roof
Waiting for a small fire and then flee to the spot
And let us ride up to heavens to the next level
Let me do my part
It feels like your hands were designed to be on my body
You best believe that and I agree with you too
Like I was made to be your girl, yeah
And you already know
That's why I won't give my time to just anybody
You know I'm with your baby
'Cause my time's your time, my world's your world
So if it's cool with you
I'ma tell my girls go out tonight, without me
Nothing's to do with you, let's bring the party to the house tonight
'Cause tonight I'm ready, yeah
I'd rather be with my, baby
I think it's time that me and him go to the next level
ooh, I'm gonna love em' like crazy
I hope he's ready cause we gonna go to the next level
Baby, ain't nothing left to do but rock on

Ain't nobody

Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you 
holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

I can love you with my eyes closed
I see your heart through a blind fold
I ain't never ever met another better
So my baby ain't no way that I'ma let go
From the north to the south pole
On the east or the west coast
Every area code, all over the globe
Ain't no way on the planet you can go that I won't

From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around,
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

Cause I got days and days of love, for you boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
Cause I got so much love for you boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8, 25/8

You ain't gotta worry about me, no

You were wrong
So was I
So what are we gonna do?
So tonight

Whatever you wanna do

It's up to you

And that's why I
Don't mind

and i don't have any more time or energy to waste
So I'm waving my white flag
sad it has to be like that

Don't it seem like, like I'm always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time, a terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working made me an addict
Theres way more people that want it than people that have it
I dont get it, I would hate to think I tricked 'em
They fall victim to my system, guess I sure know how to pick 'em
And I'm always her regret, yeah, I'm always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever's coming next
It goes up and down, it's just up and down
She's crying now but she'll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
In expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she's not the type to hold grudges
I'm wrong.
Bad boys aint no good
Good boys aint no fun

I've been logging in my bed, crying til my eyes are red
We both said that things will change
But it's still the same shade of gray
I get mad you walk away
When it all just start to fade
I know you're fed up so am I
But we just can't say goodbye
Boy, you know I love
But I just can't go on no more
Feelin this way

[Chorus]
You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right?
Just can't get it right
Don't know why, why, why?

Boy you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
And you need to know

A woman
She needs more than material things
A woman
Needs so much more than what I make her say

A woman
Needs you to make love to her, she needs more than sex
Oh, a real woman needs a real man
They don't talk about it, be about it
Put that work, and still shows his woman real romance

Boy you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
And you need to know

Look how the tables turn
You had a loss for words

It's been too long for us to let it burn
I know you're mad right now
But we're gonna talk this out
Better or worse that's what we said
So there's no walkin' out

I can be wrong
You can be right
Let's call it a night

But it's hard to hold a shadow
You said goodbye but I couldn't hear
Too busy praying for a miracle

And you left me on my knees
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency to intervene
While I was begging God for you to love me

I prayed about us every night, mhmm
Boy I know you had to hear me
You could have stopped me then and told the truth
But instead, you put a pillow over your head

Happy to be in your life, just wait until tonight

But I feel I don't know how.
And still I just can't hold it one more day,
So I think I'll let it out.

You're on my mind more than I may show
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want,
Is for you to fall apart.
Your future will get clearer,
I want you to remember.

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
And each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be...

We can't change the things,
That we done, that's in the past.
But fighting won't get us anywhere,
So if you want, here's my hand...

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oooo (oh, oh, oh, oh) oooo

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real sh** (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

It's Mary J., she's back

Show love, show love
Show love, show love

All those people talkin'
Trippin', asking about what you wearing

The chick in the corner hatin'
Starin', you know she's always schemin'

Just keep on movin', provin', this is what you doin'

For every person that doubts you
Clowns you bringing that negative energy around you

You gotta just keep breathin'
Be happy that your heart is beatin'

Stop fightin', just be easy
'Cuz it could all be gone

Keep doing what you doin'
'Cuz it could all be gone

Don't worry, show some love

We've been through the storm
We've been through it all
We had some close calls
But never would fall

We climbed all the mountains
Walked through all the valleys
And you never left me behind

I found my way through the clouds
No more running scared and closing my eyes
I will be true, this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

Oh I will survive
As long as it's you by my side
I will survive

As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger

You think I procrastinate baby
But I think I'm taking my time
You think you need to leave

I'll let it go girl, it's over
But before we say good bye
Let's give it a try

If you leave then baby I'll leave

But I have no doubt
We can work it out

You just don't know when to let up baby

Looking for someone to love me
I’m-m-m looking for someone to love me
yeh-yeh-yeh-yeah
I’m no angel
there so much I can take
calm down, patience
don’t lose your temper hold on wait
I’ve got issues just like you
sometimes I get so confused
I’m strong but I can break
I’ll be praying so hard
to get through the day
bad thoughts in my mind I can’t shake
having nightmares in the day can you relate?

Please somebody kindly wake me
I can’t let this cold world take me
I’m looking

It’s my life, my life, word to Mary
n-ggas can’t f-ck with me, Virgin Mary
go ahead make my day, dirty Harry
Weezy, f-ck the World pop ya cherry
everybody pushing but I don’t fall back

Whenever I say your name, whenever I call to mind your face
Whatever bread's in my mouth, whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Whenever your memory feeds my soul, whatever got broken becomes whole
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together

Wherever I lay me down, wherever I put my head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name

Whenever those dark clouds hide the moon
Whenever this world has gotten so strange
I know that something's gonna change
Something's gonna change

Whenever I say your name, Whenever I say your name, I'm already praying, I'm already praying
I'm already filled with a joy that I can't explain
Wherever I lay me down, wherever I rest my weary head to sleep

Baby, can I talk to you for a minute?
Ohhh
Ohh
Listen

Boy, you had me fooled
I can't believe you
Cuz' you never done anything that I asked of you
Always talkin' like I just can't do right
Blamin' me for everything and that just ain't right

Cuz' I can't do this alone (I don't know what to do)
Alone (I'm tryna stay with you)
It's not all about you (Ohhh)
Boy, I can't do this alone (You're makin' this harder)
Alone (Boy, I'm 'bout to leave ya)
Cuz' I can't do this alone
(Alone, alone, alone)

And I gave you everything I had, yeah
And I never said nothin'
Did everything for you
What did you do? Nothing
Then you got the nerve to wanna run your mouth
Like I ain't never held you down
Baby, what did I do to deserve this?
Cuz' I put you on a shelf
Girl, I need help
Cuz' I can't do this alone, baby

Cuz' I can't do this alone (I don't know what to do)

Uh-huh, eh-heh
Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)

You only a customer
When you walkin in the presence of hust-lers
Uhh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls
You can taste it, my instict's basic
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es
All different colors of the spectrum
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em
Believe me I'm a conniseur when I inspect 'em
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers
These young rookies, fail to understand
Every summer I return like the ice cream man
Drop what you doin, get-it get-it while you can
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's
You know what I do, drive your tastebuds crazy

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (LL)]
Like lemondrops with chocolate kisses

Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame?

You say one love, one life
(One life)
It's one need in the night
One love
(One love)
Get to share it
Leaves you darling
If you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Time on my hands since you been away boy
I ain't got no plans, no no no no
And the sound of the rain against my windowpane
Is slowly, is slowly drivin' me insane, boy

I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

Sleep don't come easy, boy please believe me
Since you been gone everything's goin' wrong
Why'd you have to say, "Goodbye", look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from fallin' from my eyes, baby

Life can be only what you make it
When you're feelin' down
You should never fake it
Say what's on your mind
And you'll find in time
That all the negative energy
It would all cease

And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
Except for the man up above

Anything you say to me
