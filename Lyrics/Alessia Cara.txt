Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are

Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh

My daddy says that life comes at you fast
We are like blades of grass
We come to prime and in time we just wither away
And it all changes
My view with a looking glass won't catch the past
Only photographs remind us of the passing of days
Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
See, I recall being afraid of the dark
And holding on to teddy bears
I'd wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
That was then and now I'm here

And the night is mine

So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn't wait til I could be seventeen
I thought he lied when he said take my time to dream
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I'm Seventeen

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here

Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
with this boy who's hollerin' and I can hardly hear
over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you

So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, "What am I doin' here?"

You'll never face a judge without me
You'll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then I'll be still here, proudly waiting to kill more time

Nobody asked you to get me attached to you

But, boy, you pushed me
So all that I'm asking
Is that you handle me with caution
Cause I don't give myself often
But I guess I'll try today

‘Cause I've had my heart broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore

Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See, I knew I was destined for bigger and better, but never said a thing

For my dreams in my dreams, so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me, but made me so crazy in love with it

Read between these lines
Unspoken weight of words
But time comes to rest when you are by my side, it blurs

When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

See, I need you and, baby, I need to
Let down my guard and give you my scars
Open up my heart

Rap on my window, come home
It's been a while, so stick around, why don't you?
'Til the end of time
Say that you'll be mine

She just wants to be, beautiful
She goes, unnoticed she knows, no limits
She craves, attention she praises, an image
She prays to be, sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see, the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain, and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry, after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,

Yes, I'll set fire to my whole room (Ah, ah, ah)

Or that pigment or religion really matters

At least the bubble that we've
Created could make for some good TV

Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs

I made the mistake, of writing your name on my heart
'Cause you colours showed
But it was too late, you left me stained, caught it off

Do you crave control?
I've been your doll, that you poke for fun too long
So you should go
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My word is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You hit up a sway I'm on the ropes
I found my footing my own
When you came, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone
Alone, alone, no no

There ain't no love 'round here

There's yelling in the hallway
I found refuge on a twin bed
Of this three-star hotel
I hear the laughter from the TV
Static, Rachel talks to Phoebe
About the cat that smells
And I know this place is haunted, oh
I swear I hear somebody knocking
But I can't really tell

And this outlet's busted
Phone died, and I can't charge it
What a life, man, what a life this is, mmm

Just me, myself, and nothing
But I taught me how to love it
Home is wherever I live

Ah, ah, ah ah

And Oz was just a lonely man

Strange world, strange world

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
We try to help it, but we won't
All we know is that we don't
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
The chips will fall, and so it goes
And it's all out of our control
All we know is that we don't

What it would be like to love you
Now I've seen every hole in your heart
I'm used to loving slowly
But this time, you already know me
I hope you like all the broken parts

Oh, we can't run away from the comfortable

Baby, baby, baby, this love ain't a game

Sleeve of my t-shirt

So if I should die tomorrow

Making the campfire out of broken flashlights
Jealous of your high tops
'Cause someone stole mine
Wish somebody would've told
Me that would be alright

My kind of time's meant to
Carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are
The one's that don't end

Rain down on your petty parade

Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart
Just to shut 'em up

Every path I make, every road leads back

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits,
She craves attention, she praises an image,
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain, and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen beforeyou used to call me on my cell phone

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

In my room, staying up late
And I'm planning my escape
Cause I know I can't stay
In my veins I got the feeling
Like there must be something more
I've never been so sure

All night and day
I dream of a place

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowded city lights
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

These streets aren't easy
And I need your handle
...

I won't tell you I'm lonely
'Cause it might be selfish
I won't ask you to hold me
'Cause that won't mend what's helpless

There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing
For your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

Oh
When did you fall out of love?
Out of love?

I've been standing at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Though I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
It's time I let you go
I made the mistake, of writing your name on my heart
'Cause you colours showed
But it was too late, you left me stained, caught it off

Do you crave control?
I've been your doll, that you poke for fun too long
So you should go
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My word is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You hit up a sway I'm on the ropes
I found my footing my own
When you came, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone
Alone, alone, no no

There ain't no love 'round here
...

Someday I won't be afraid of my head
Someday I will not be chained to my bed
Someday I'll forget the day he left
But surely not today
One day I won't need a PhD
To sit me down and tell me what it all means
Maybe one day it'll be a breeze, ah
But surely not today, but surely not today

Oh, you don't know what sadness means
'Til you're too sad to fall asleep
One day I'll be snoozing peacefully
But surely not today

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was OD like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no mo-o-o-ore
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I (I)
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
