One thing I discovered
Is that every single day and night I think about you
Don't wanna be with no one else if I can help
I'd rather be by myself

Cause nobody in this world that makes me feel like you do!
Whenever you're around I can't come down
I swear you got me caught up
I get butterflies deep down inside
That's why I know it's our love
I feel if that if ho looking down

See I will just have to respect your wishes boy
Cus if I stay ain't no tellin' what may happen boy
Although you look so good to me, it's best that I leave

But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me

Tatted on his chest (uh huh)

And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)

He said
Hi, my name is so and so
Baby, can you tell me yours?
You look like you came to do
One thing (Set it off)
I started on the left
And I had to take him to the right
He was out of breath
But he kept on dancin' all night

You tryin, admit it
But you just can't fight the feelin' inside
You know it
And I can see it in your eyes
You want me
You smooth as a mother
You're so undercover
By the way that you was watchin' me

Ooh, uh
The way you look at me
I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it
Tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh
When you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you
Move, ring the alarm
The club is jumpin' now
So get up

I said: Ciara's on you radio
Everybody, turn it up
Spicy just like hot sauce
Careful, you might burn it up
You can do the pop lock
Ragtime, don't stop
That's the way you gotta get
Get it, make ya body rock

Nothing I'm afraid of

Wonder if I ever cross your mind
Keeping you up in your bed at night

Lovin' you is somethin' strange (So strange)
Don't get me wrong I ain't complainin' (No)

From the first day that I met you, it was special
There was something different 'bout you
Had to pray 'fore, 'fore I jumped into it head first
Ain't an expert but I know I never, ever felt like this

Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

August 4th, we were chilling at the house
Said I'm done, I told you to get out
Didn't mean a word that I said
Cause I was hoping you would come back

(Bridge)
Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
And I tried to fight and I cried to God
"Oh please let it just work"
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed baby

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
(Baby I'm sorry)
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this, (baby I want this)

And I will be here all the way, baby

Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me I handle my business
Any city any town, touch down I do my thing
I'ma hustler baby I provide by any means

I'ma great conversationalist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley it's on
Out the headache and stress you done been through before

It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on comin' back
My girlfriends tellin' me I don't know how to act
But I'm tellin' them baby bye fall back

He's so good and he knows how to love me
But so hood and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you betta get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me, they say

That he does it with the best, runs a lil' less
Tatted on his chest, I like it, so what, I like it
And they say that he's gonna hurt me, just wait and see
But they don't know me 'cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you

Girl, you wanna act like he did (what I'm talkin' bout')
Security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring (joint Account)
Joint account and another one he don't know about (hey)

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?
'Cause I'm out, four in the morning on the corner, rolling, doing my own thing
Oh!

What if I, had a thing on the side
Made you cry?
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad what, you mad?

Go run the streets (just like 'em)

Someone who can hold me
Is that you?

Looking for the only one who I can give my all to
Tell me if it's you, you, you

You can give me extra credit baby

Verse 1
It's serious.	
I don't care if you're in your car.	
I don't care if you're on the dance floor.		
And it don't matter who you are.
It takes you over.

Hook
It's crazy what could you be doin(what you doin)?
Tell how come you're not move(why aren't you movin)?
Energy let the music get you high.
It moves you when you see the flashing lights.

Chorus
It feels so good I can't control my waist.
I can't control my hips.
It makes me want to break.
And therefore, I proceed to break it down.
And therefore, I proceed to break it down
And therefore, I proceed to break it down.
And therefore, I proceed to break it down.

Verse 2
I bet you're curious.
How I pop so hard and make my back break.
It's in the beat, why aren't you hearing this?
Hit me so hard you feel the big bass.

Yes one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me I handle mah business
Any City any town, touch down I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a bring conversation, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley Azure
Out the headache an stress you done been through before
It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back

My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say
That he does it with the best,
runs it in the west

Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants

I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turing me on

But this feelin', I think he's so cute
And I wanna tell him so bad, but I can't

Yeah, I got one really bad
This is how he makes me feel

He puts the beat in my heart
Every time I see him thoughts are getting deeper
And I knew from the start, yeah
From a 'Hi" and 'Nice to meet ya', I was blinded by his features

Girl said, "You're gone"
But I say, "La la la la la, la la la la la"
She said, "C you're in love"
But I said, "Nuh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh"

C is for your confidence but I love the cool in you

If I react, you tell me to relax
Too late to take it back
Cause boy you put me through it

This circular motion is all we do
I'm so sick of going back and forth with you
You should have been happy to have me
You said you wanted to have some kids build a family
Now I
Wish it wasn't true
It's killing me to do

What I gotta do
The problem here is you
Ain't nobody new not even my crew
Could take the place of you
The problem here is you

Cause if you only knew, what I felt for you
You would have held on tighter
Fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see
You'll reach out for me
Boy you had a keeper

but im hoping you can change

I trusted him with everything 
never held back anything
thought we'd be 2gether for the rest of our lives
but suddenly he took his love away
and made it hard to trust again (oooo)

I know i been holding back
but he really hurt me bad
i dont wanna take my past
and put it all on u
im not tryna hold you back
really hope you understand
i dont know what im gonna do

Just for staying in my lane
Life's full of adversities
You're real when u can stay the same

Never thought in a million years (noooo) I would blow up
And be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
And I'm the CEO call me the owner 
And I can do anything that I wanna 
And I never thought that I'd rather be flying high
And I'd be gone
You can call me Hollywood
And tip my heart and see my home

Verse 1:
21, and I've realized,
Everything you want's not meant to be.
21 then you qualify,
To stand up to reponsibilities.
So I tried to prioritize
By deciding what I know is best for me.

And Then there's always, love that tries to trip you up.
You try to catch yourself before you hit the ground.
But nothings promised.
Friends are there to cheer you up,
To give you strength and build you up when you are down.
So I set sail in motion

Chorus:
I say 
So long, farewell,
My lifes moving forward.
My ship has sailed,
And I'm so glad it's over.
My heart mends well,
After all that I've been through

You know me, if he's a buster then you won't see me with him
Yeah, I know you want it but what do you got on it?

'Cause I'm high price
Better have on a hot pair of Nikes
Better buy me anything I like
'Cause I'm already holdin', holdin'

High price
Better have on a hot pair of Nikes
Better buy me anything I like
'Cause I'm already holdin', holdin'

Ahh, ahh, ahh, already

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, already

Already holdin'

See me in the drop head, fresh up out the hair salon
Booty look softer than a McDonalds hamburger bun
I got the edible dessert on my wrist
Please believe I'm a ten, yeah, shawty, I'm the shit

Tryna talk to me
Always tryna buy me things
Drinks to diamond rings

Fast cars, first class
To the Philippines
That's a daily thing
It don't interest me

Just then it came as a surprise
When I looked into your eyes
Never walked up to a guy
But here I go

I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is

And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is

What did I say to him last night?
I can't feel my face,
Try to focus but my mind ain't right.
I remember the party,
The DJ, my homies, my man and me.
But the rest of it's blurry,
Something I did made my baby go away.
Got the same clothes on today,
That I had on yesterday.
What did I do, what did I say?
But I don't remember,
Guess I had too much to drink,
'cause I don't remember.

Oh, my car ain't outside,
How the hell did I get home?
Damn, did he drive me,
Drop me off, got his stuff and got gone?

I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

So I'm supposed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you but I won't be a fool for you
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean I'mma stay if you could tell the truth

But you can't, no matter how much time I ask

Is that your bitch over there, giving' me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair

You ain't gon' respect me no no no till I'm not there
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared

Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me

And I ain't comin' back

So you can put a car right there

An' you can ask anybody 'cuz they seen me do it

Throw all the dirt you want it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back pickin' out baskets of fruit
Yeah, freaky Petey love you too ha ha, you know how I do

You may look at me and think that I'm

Take me to a place

Ladies & gentlemen, I think it's time to switch roles

C I A R A

Pull up your pants 
Just Like It
Take out the trash 
Just Like It
Gettin' your cash like em' 
Fast like em' 
Girl you oughta act like ya dig 
I'm talkin' bout'
Security codes on everything 
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring 
Have a Joint Account
And another one he don't know about 

I wish we could switch up the roles 
And I could be that... 
Tell you I love you 
But when you call I never get back 
Would you ask them questions like me?... 
Like where you be at? 
Cause I'm out 4: 00 in the morning 
On the corner rollin'
Doin' my own thing 
Ohh 

What if I
Had a thing on the side
Made you cry? 
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy 

Can't be gettin mad
What You Mad? 
Can't Handle that?
Can't be gettin mad
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?

I wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...

Go head and be... 
Just Like It
Go run the streets 
Just Like It

My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

(verse 1: Petey Pablo)
I got a sick reputation for handlin' broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And in my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there
I'm the truth
I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
Cause they seen me do it
Barracades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back, pickin' out baskets of fruit
(I love you, boo)
Yeah, Freaky Petey loves you too
Ha, ha
You know how I do

You may look at me and think that I'm
Just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for

Ladies, it's your song
So as soon as this come on
You should get out on the floor
Gon' and get your sexy on
If you know that you better
Than the new girl that he on
Go 'head and tell him now
"You gon' miss me when I'm gone"

Aye yo, Ci Ci
Let me show you how to do a singin' bitch, greasy
You was by Lennox, yeah the one on Peach Street
I was with Demetri, seen you on your lovin' hip hop men, D. C

"F**k these petty niggas" is a bitch motto
If I say I don't wax, every bitch follow
If I'm sippin' in the club, mix Moscato
I got a big fat ass, big dicks follow
Hit him with the back shots
Hit him with the ass shots
Take him to the bank then I hit him with cash shots
I do it big, I hit him with the caps lock
I'm gonna ball, I hit him with the mascot
No, I never been there, but I like to Bangkok
Big fat titties when they hangin' out my tanktop
You gon' play me
On Instagram niggas tryna shade me
But your bitch at home tryna play me
I'm Nicki and Weezy F, baby
Man, f**k you and your lady
Gon' butt you, cause you shady
Now which bitch run it?

Don't fucking forget it

Said I'm done, I told you to get out
Didn't mean a word that I said
Cause I was hoping you would come back

Cause I tried and tried

Up late at night and I hurt
And I tried to fight and I cried to god

Any City any town, touch down I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a bring conversation, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley Azure
Out the headache an stress you done been through before
It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back

My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say
That he does it with the best,
runs it in the west

Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants
his girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turing me on

Ladies & gentlemen, I think it's time to switch roles

C I A R A

Pull up your pants 
Just Like It
Take out the trash 
Just Like It
Gettin' your cash like em' 
Fast like em' 
Girl you oughta act like ya dig 
I'm talkin' bout'
Security codes on everything 
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring 
Have a Joint Account
And another one he don't know about 

I wish we could switch up the roles 
And I could be that... 
Tell you I love you 
But when you call I never get back 
Would you ask them questions like me?... 
Like where you be at? 
Cause I'm out 4: 00 in the morning 
On the corner rollin'
Doin' my own thing 
Ohh 

What if I
Had a thing on the side
Made you cry? 
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy 

Can't be gettin mad
What You Mad? 
Can't Handle that?
Can't be gettin mad
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?

I wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...

Go head and be... 
Just Like It
Go run the streets 
Just Like It

Catch me in the mall, you know I buy it out
G5 plane, yeah I fly it out
Ass on the back look like 'Lac sittin' on 28s
No you can't get her if you ain't got plenty cake
ATL, Georgia, booties look like this size
23 waist, pretty face, thick thighs

I can do it big, I can do it long
I can do it whenever or however you want
I can do it up and down, I can do circles
To him I'm a gymnast, this room is my circus

I market it so good
They can't wait to try I I I I me e e a a

Handle my business like a big girl should

Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
The way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine
Imagine if there was a million me's talking sexy to you like that
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze and I need you to push it right back

Baby, show me, show me
What's your favorite trick that you wanna use on me
And I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowing and going
'Till clothing disappears, ain't nothing but shoes on me
Oh, baby

All night, show it, just you and the crowd
Doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

'Hi, my name is so and so

And I had to take him to the right
He was out of breath
But he kept on dancin' all night

You tryin, admit it
But you just can fight the feelin inside
You know it
And I can see it in your eyes
You want me
You smooth as a mother
You're so undercover
By the way that you was watchin' me

Ooh! uh

see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors any more, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by, dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

Chorus
It feels so good I can't control my waist.
I can't control my hips.
It makes me want to break.
And therefore, I proceed to break it down.
And therefore, I proceed to break it down
And therefore, I proceed to break it down.
And therefore, I proceed to break it down.

Verse 2
I bet you're curious.
How I pop so hard and make my back break.

Hit me so hard you feel the big bass.

Any City any town, touch down I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a bring conversation, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley Azure
Out the headache an stress you done been through before
It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back

My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say
That he does it with the best,
runs it in the west

Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)

But the dope boy's turing me on

Yeah, I got one really bad
This is how he makes me feel

He puts the beat in my heart
Every time I see him thoughts are getting deeper
And I knew from the start, yeah
From a 'Hi" and 'Nice to meet ya', I was blinded by his features

Girl said, "You're gone"
But I say, "La la la la la, la la la la la"
She said, "C you're in love"
But I said, "Nuh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh"

C is for your confidence but I love the cool in you

Too late to take it back
Cause boy you put me through it

This circular motion is all we do
I'm so sick of going back and forth with you
You should have been happy to have me
You said you wanted to have some kids build a family
Now I
Wish it wasn't true
It's killing me to do

What I gotta do
The problem here is you
Ain't nobody new not even my crew
Could take the place of you
The problem here is you

Cause if you only knew, what I felt for you
You would have held on tighter
Fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see
You'll reach out for me
Boy you had a keeper

21, and I've realized,
Everything you want's not meant to be.
21 then you qualify,
To stand up to reponsibilities.
So I tried to prioritize
By deciding what I know is best for me.

And Then there's always, love that tries to trip you up.
You try to catch yourself before you hit the ground.
But nothings promised.
Friends are there to cheer you up,
To give you strength and build you up when you are down.
So I set sail in motion

Chorus:

So long, farewell,
My lifes moving forward.
My ship has sailed,
And I'm so glad it's over.

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

I don't want anybody to know
How much my body craves you
Every time I come around you

I know you got me fooled over, chilling on your sofa
I love watching you watch the game in the sofa
I hope that you're thinking the same
What to do?

I'm trying to have a private party in your room
I'm feeling kinda naughty, how about you?
Turn your bed into a dance floor
Just knock your door, put on your radio

Now turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
I don't want them to hear what we're doing
So just turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
I'll be screaming so loud, don't you dare turn it down

And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me

So I'm supposed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you but I won't be a fool for you
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean I'mma stay if you could tell the truth
But you can't, no matter how much time I ask

Is that your bitch over there, giving' me the ugly stare

Baby right before I say goodnight

Sweat dripping from my body, we both at this party,
So come and show me your moves, I got some things I can teach you too
If you wanna see, oh oh
You say you need a shot of the Henee
Then you're ready
Do what you need to do
Cause I'll be waiting for you
It's about to get hot and heavy, oh oh

It's really late
You're getting closer and the lights off
Your body is in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising wild and wild on you

Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love

Margiela, Pucci, Givenchy
All of that fly look good on me
Gorilla, Jordan, Cavalli
Wanna know what's next, just wait on me
London, Paris, Tokyo
All of these places that we can go
New York, Vegas, to overseas
Ain't nothing like rolling with a Georgia peach

You can't seem to get me off your brain
Going crazy, about to go insane
I won't stop until you scream my name
There's no limit where we're going babe

Don't you know that we're just getting started
Ain't nothing really dropping till we get in the party
Go head and take your chance, if we're lucky
Everybody gon' be right here rocking until the morning
Here it go

Cause I wanna get stuck on you tonight
Yeah I wanna get stuck on you tonight
Tell me can I get stuck on you tonight?
Cause I'm gonna get stuck on you tonight

You can't seem to get me off your brain
Going crazy, about to go insane
I won't stop until you scream my name

You know what I think?
You should just fly

If you have any fears
Let'em go, let'em go
I woke up wasting your kiss
You can go, there's the door

And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'ma let you know, now I'll let you go

You should fly
For the first time in a long time
Just fly
Let you go, let you go
Let you fly

I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

So I'm supposed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you but I won't be a fool for you
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean I'mma stay if you could tell the truth

But you can't, no matter how much time I ask

Is that your bitch over there, giving' me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair

You ain't gon' respect me no no no till I'm not there
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared

I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me

Oh I wish the whole word, they could see
I should take a picture so your love lasts longer
Cause I know that no one's gon' believe
If I told them about your love

Yeah and I know I shouldn't kiss and tell
About the way you do my body babe
Yeah and I know I shouldn't kiss and tell

Cried words I didn't know I knew

Kiss me, hold me

You make love and you not easy

Baby you and I can have a good time
Tell me what you like ooh ooh

Now listen, I've been single for a while now
And I been kinda lonely

Someone who can hold me
Is that you?

I'm looking for somebody I can call boo
Looking for the only one who I can give my all to
Tell me if it's you, you, you
What you gonna do, do, do
Make a move

You can be my teacher, I'll do homework
You can give me extra credit baby
I'll do more work
What you gonna do, do, do
Now it's me and you, you, you
Move

How it feels so right
You can be my prince, my knight
You can be my superman
Save me here I am

There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you

Throw it up, dubs on tha Cadillac

Chokin' on that home-grown

It's Crazy

It's time to make a difference
I know he's bad
Right now I'm feeling like I need him in my life
I don't wanna leave him
He's my best friend
And me without him
I can't see us breaking up
People said it wouldn't work
I'd end up getting hurt
But what do they know because he's my man
I don't care what people say
Cause this feel good to me
And I don't want him to leave

It's crazy (crazy)
Tell me how come (oohh oo)
Something I really want
And something I love is so bad for me
I can't explain it (can't explain it)
It's just like a bad habit (oohhh)
I can't shake it
So crazy, crazy, crazy
I can't believe it (oohh)
How I need him (how I need him)
He makes a difference
Yall I'm trippin'
It's crazy (crazy)
Don't know which way to go
Can't let him go
Even though, I know he ain't the one for me

Now he stay in some drama
Can't take him home to mama
Imma be honest

And right now I'ma take the time to shout out

It feels funny to hear the world say my name
I'm makin' money, I'm still the same, I won't change
And if you down with me stick around with me
'Cuz I'ma hold you down and that's no doubt and I

I want my hood to represent me

Around the world to represent me

Ladies & gentlemen, I think it's time to switch roles

C I A R A

Pull up your pants 
Just Like It
Take out the trash 
Just Like It
Gettin' your cash like em' 
Fast like em' 
Girl you oughta act like ya dig 
I'm talkin' bout'
Security codes on everything 
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring 
Have a Joint Account
And another one he don't know about 

I wish we could switch up the roles 
And I could be that... 
Tell you I love you 
But when you call I never get back 
Would you ask them questions like me?... 
Like where you be at? 
Cause I'm out 4: 00 in the morning 
On the corner rollin'
Doin' my own thing 
Ohh 

What if I
Had a thing on the side
Made you cry? 
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy 

Can't be gettin mad
What You Mad? 
Can't Handle that?
Can't be gettin mad
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?

I wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...

Go head and be...

Go run the streets

I'm saying that I'm sorry
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

August 4th, we were chilling at the house
Said I'm done, I told you to get out
Didn't mean a word that I said
Cause I was hoping you would come back

(Bridge)
Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
And I tried to fight and I cried to God
"Oh please let it just work"
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed baby

()
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
(Baby I'm sorry)
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this, (baby I want this)
Say baby I'll do what it takes
And I will be here all the way, baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
