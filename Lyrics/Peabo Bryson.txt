Here we are in a room full of strangers
And an open door
Here we are away from all dangers
But that open door is calling out again

Acting like a friend who wants to know
If you might come away
I wonder what you'll say

On wings of the night
Once again you'll take flight
And I don't hear your voice anymore

Seen a light divine, seen water turn to wine
I've seen healing hands and walking on the water
I've knelt in churches but that was all just fruitless searches
For something to believe in when I thought I'd seen it all

But I never saw a miracle 'til baby, I found you
I prayed I'd find my heaven then all my prayers came true
No, I never saw a miracle, I was blind but now I see
The miracle is the love you give to me, oh yeah

Seen a flower bloom and a man walk on the moon

A light shines in your eyes and it burns through my soul till my heart feels the fire;
Tonight is all we'll ever know;
So let's take what we can and let's find a way to forget that we're all so alone.

You'll be my shelter from the storm and I will keep you safe and warm.
We'll take this moment and make this moment last forever.
We'll never let the morning come.
We'll hide away from the light;
Hold on to this magic we've made til we're lost in the night.

Our days fly by so fast ...in the heat of our heart love can slip through my fingers;

Ooh, yeah, baby
Whoa-whoa-oh-oh-
Mmm-

Now I-m the kinda guy who don't believe
That chivalry is dead, no
'Cause I believe a woman should be treated
With the utmost respect, mmm-hmm-

Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away
I wanna get to know ya, well
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame
Just come and look me over

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, woo-hoo-

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even (Help her with her coat), well
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)

Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop

There've been too many sad goodbyes
Too many tears I've cried
Promises made and dreams that died
Have left me hurt inside
I want your love
Like none I've known before
But unless you're sure
Don't you give your heart
Unless you give it all the way
Don't give me just the part
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart
It takes so long for me to mend
Each time love comes to an end

Put some polish on your toes
And then slip into somethin' fine
It's our time, baby

Put everything aside
I'm telling you to let it ride
'Cause tonight is yours and mine
You don't have to say it

I know that you've been neglected
More than I would care to mention
But tonight that's gonna be corrected
You'll get my complete attention

And we're gonna be closer than close
Part of one another
So into each other
We're more than lovers
But closer than most

Have turned out so wrong

I need my arms around you

Everytime I'm near you
Something comes over me

Say the words and set me free
Free

Love's supposed to mean forever
But love is a road to mistake

Born in that manger
To bring the world joy

So hush up little baby

And teach them while you do
You have nothing
To fear because you know
God is with you all the way

I know we still need the quiet
time
We can celebrate this special
time
And we don't need company
вЂЁWe'll just set the mood
with conversation

If I could
I'd protect you
From the sadness
In your eyes
Give you courage
In a world
Of compromise
Yes, I would

If I could
I would teach you
All the things

And I'd help you
Cross the bridges

Yes, I would

Do You Wanna Get Serious


When I left you tonight
Well you looked so good
Baby
There was moonlight
In your hair
And God only knows
How I hated to leave you
Just standing there
I could've held you
Forever and ever
But the moment wasn't right
So I let go and took off
For another lonely night
Now I'd like

Ooh, hoo, yeah
Mmm, hmm

Tired of living life

Like a rainbow in the sky
Crying to be seen

When I open my eyes
to find inspiration
I search for the best I can see
If I settle for less
I won t be the best I can be

It's cost me a lot but there’s one thing that I've got
It’s my man, it’s my man
Cold and wet, tired, you bet
All of this I’ll soon forget with my man

He’s not much on looks, ain't no hero out of books
But I love him, yes, I, I love him
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me but I love him

I don’t know why I should
He isn't true, he makes me blue
What can I do?

I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did you last
Let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Lookin' back
Over my years
I guessed
I've shedded some tears
Told myself time
And time again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight
Things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'd better let it go
(What you think about it, girl)
Let it go, baby (Oh, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

Tried to take control
Of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts
Sense of time
And have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps
And the bruises
Of all the things
Of a two-time loser
Tryin' to hold on
Faith is gone
It's just
Another sad song

I think
I'd better let it go
(What you say about it?)

Painting pictures on the window pane
Feelings my heart cannot explain
Oh, the silence, sounds like music
Seems like I can hear a melody
Baby that's what you do to me
One thing I'm sure of, whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you, tonight
And if you want me to, baby ask me to stay
Heaven's just a whisper away

Reach for the sky

Somewhere we lost a part

It was too late when I realized

The forest for the trees

There comes a time in every life
Love will come your way
And if it should stay
You'd better hold on to it tight
And never let it go

All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop

I make my livin' on the run
My life is lonely but I was born to need no one
Always on my own, ohh

My gun is loaded
I'm a six-shot heart attack
I pull the trigger
So you better watch your back

Lookin' out for number one
So you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your ass goodbye

Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky

Somewhere we lost a part

It was too late when I realized
That I couldn't see
The forest for the trees

You'd better hold on to it tight

Oh, oh, whoa, show and tell just a game I play
When I wanna say I love you
Oh, oh, whoa, now show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby, baby

These are the hands that can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere in sight

I love you more than words can say 
Smile, say cheese pretty-please

How'd you ever get so big

And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist

How could anybody ask for much more, woo-hoo-

Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

I've knelt in churches but that was all just fruitless searches
For something to believe in when I thought I'd seen it all

But I never saw a miracle 'til baby, I found you
I prayed I'd find my heaven then all my prayers came true
No, I never saw a miracle, I was blind but now I see
The miracle is the love you give to me, oh yeah

Seen a flower bloom and a man walk on the moon

You love so dangerously
Your not trusting your heart to any one
You told me you were gonna play it smart
Through before we start
But I bealieve we've only just begun
When it this good there's no saying no
I want you so I may let you go

Throught the fire
Through land and to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I gladly risk it all
Through the fire
To what ever comes one day
For the chance to be with you
I take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know your afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
I can help if you only let me try
You have touched me and something and renewed
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready to kiss that tear goodbye
When it's this sweet there's no saying no
I want you so I may let you go

Suddenly you're in love
But it's hard for me tell
What really lies behind the smile

And I feel no shame 'cause it's the same old love

Off and on again, love

Through before we start
But I bealieve we've only just begun
When it this good there's no saying no
I want you so I may let you go

Throught the fire
Through land and to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I gladly risk it all
Through the fire
To what ever comes one day
For the chance to be with you
I take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know your afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
I can help if you only let me try
You have touched me and something and renewed
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready to kiss that tear goodbye
When it's this sweet there's no saying no
I want you so I may let you go

Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop

Seen a light divine, seen water turn to wine
I've seen healing hands and walking on the water
I've knelt in churches but that was all just fruitless searches
For something to believe in when I thought I'd seen it all

But I never saw a miracle 'til baby, I found you
I prayed I'd find my heaven then all my prayers came true
No, I never saw a miracle, I was blind but now I see
The miracle is the love you give to me, oh yeah

Seen a flower bloom and a man walk on the moon

Here we are in a room full of strangers
And an open door
Here we are away from all dangers
But that open door is calling out again

Acting like a friend who wants to know
If you might come away
I wonder what you'll say

On wings of the night
Once again you'll take flight
And I don't hear your voice anymore

Easy come love, weighing satisfaction
But that's not enough as time goes by
Some say love leads to distraction
Love is a game where the players never win

When you're close to me and we are as one
I'll let my heart believe that a new day has begun
And I feel no shame 'cause it's the same old love

Off and on again, love
(Off and on again, love)
To the moon again, love
(To the moon again, love)
Can't be wrong if it's love
It's the same old love, love

Friend or foe, it's your decision
Just let me know if it's do or die, yeah
Take it slow, love can be a prison
An eternal flame that never burns to an end

It's my destiny and you are the one
I try desperately to hold on to my heart
Here I go again, facing the same old love

You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Ever a surprise

How could you question what I'd be

When the circus comes to town

More than just a crazy game, a fantasy
Full of joy and pain, part of reality
It's calling out your name
Somebody said that you've been searchin',
I know you've been
For the love you lost
You never knew how much he hurt you, hurt you
You try to make a new start
Don't you know that time can't always heal a broken heart
When you know in your heart he still holds a part
Calling out your name

Your not trusting your heart to any one
You told me you were gonna play it smart
Through before we start
But I bealieve we've only just begun
When it this good there's no saying no
I want you so I may let you go

Throught the fire
Through land and to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I gladly risk it all
Through the fire
To what ever comes one day
For the chance to be with you
I take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know your afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
I can help if you only let me try
You have touched me and something and renewed
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready to kiss that tear goodbye
When it's this sweet there's no saying no
I want you so I may let you go

Easy come love, weighing satisfaction
But that's not enough as time goes by
Some say love leads to distraction
Love is a game where the players never win

When you're close to me and we are as one
I'll let my heart believe that a new day has begun
And I feel no shame 'cause it's the same old love

Off and on again, love
(Off and on again, love)
To the moon again, love
(To the moon again, love)
Can't be wrong if it's love
It's the same old love, love

Friend or foe, it's your decision
Just let me know if it's do or die, yeah
Take it slow, love can be a prison
An eternal flame that never burns to an end

It's my destiny and you are the one
I try desperately to hold on to my heart
Here I go again, facing the same old love

he stood staring at his father who was 85 years old
and he remembered all the balsams they played so long ago
so he put his arms around him and kissed him on the cheek
he said, dad it's time i told you what a friend you've been to me
if you love someone, let 'em know
if you're thinking of someone better tell 'em so
i can't understand what makes us think

Closer than close (Oh... whoa, you know)
(Somethin' I wanna say, baby)
Closer than close (Whoa... oh...)
(Ooh, hoo)

Powder your pretty nose
Put some polish on your toes
And then slip into somethin' fine
It's our time, baby

Put everything aside
I'm telling you to let it ride
'Cause tonight is yours and mine
You don't have to say it

I know that you've been neglected
More than I would care to mention
But tonight that's gonna be corrected
You'll get my complete attention

And we're gonna be closer than close
Part of one another
So into each other
We're more than lovers
But closer than most
Baby, even closer than close
For now and ever

You know you knocked me off my feet
Came and made this life worth livin?
You touched a special part of me
And gave me tender love I? ve been missin?

I don? t know what I said or did to make you think you want me, no
The question goes around inside my head
I lay awake sometimes at night and think about it, oh
How you made me whole again, life had made me so afraid

I just wanna shower you with love
With love, love
For the rest of my life
I just wanna shower you with love, all my love

You came and loved away my hurt

I just can't imagine (I just can't imagine)
Life without you

I can't imagine life without you
I always thought we made the perfect pair
I can't imagine walking into
The house we called a home, without you there

We had the love, we had the magic
How could we let it disappear
Now all the love has turned so tragic
And all my faith has turned to fear

I can't imagine life without you
Yet my restless feet are walkin' toward the door
I can't believe I'm really leavin'

A light shines in your eyes and it burns through my soul till my heart feels the fire;
Tonight is all we'll ever know;
So let's take what we can and let's find a way to forget that we're all so alone.

You'll be my shelter from the storm and I will keep you safe and warm.
We'll take this moment and make this moment last forever.
We'll never let the morning come.
We'll hide away from the light;
Hold on to this magic we've made til we're lost in the night.

Our days fly by so fast ...in the heat of our heart love can slip through my fingers;

Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop

There've been too many sad goodbyes
Too many tears I've cried
Promises made and dreams that died
Have left me hurt inside
I want your love
Like none I've known before
But unless you're sure
Don't you give your heart
Unless you give it all the way
Don't give me just the part
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart
It takes so long for me to mend
Each time love comes to an end

So you better watch your back

Lookin' out for number one
So you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your ass goodbye

Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky

Full of joy and pain, part of reality

Somebody said that you've been searchin',
I know you've been
For the love you lost
You never knew how much he hurt you, hurt you
You try to make a new start
Don't you know that time can't always heal a broken heart
