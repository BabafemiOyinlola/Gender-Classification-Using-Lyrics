Oh yeah, oh yeah
I gave her my heart, I gave her my all
I was always there whenever she'd fall
And now that everything is falling apart
Is it her is it me tell me how could this be
It's all so easy when love is brand new
But when it starts to fade, what do you do
Your heart says stay but your mind says go
How does the story end, which way do I turn
Cause everytime (everytime I try to walk away)
Something inside makes me want to stay yeah
We both know we can't go on this way

I've been thinkin' 'bout what you said
I hear your voice
It speaks inside my head
You know I'd rather be with you
And feel your touch
When I was lost
I knew you'd rescue me
I paid the cost
And now I finally see
And now I know that this was meant to be
It's all too much

Now I'm walkin' down the lonely road
And your face is all I see
I can't imagine that your love would come my way

Here I go again
Watch it now 'cause
Here I go again

I've been hurt so much before
I told myself, yes, I did
No more, no more won't get hurt any more

There I was by myself
Doin' all right
Until I saw you last night

And then I knew that

Nobody like you
No, no, no, no
Nobody like you
I've been searching, I've been looking (yeah)
Every now & than
Makes me wonder (what I'd? Do)

you were the best, the best thing baby
to ever come into my life
with you I never had to worry
you kept me so satified
Everytime, I think about you baby
Girl you just blow my mind
How could I let you get away
I must have been out of my mind

(CHORUS)
I've been searching for so long
Nobody like you

Open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine, there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.

I know you've been hurt by an old love affair
But darling, don't blame me I wasn't even there
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.

You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
And babe you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

I always knew you would come for me
And now that you're here, my whole worlds complete
You gave me so much more, more than I'd hoped for
All of my dreams are realized, girl, you made me whole

Just when I needed a friend, someone who would stay till the end
You came along and made me strong
There are no words to explain all the joy you bring

'Cause in you I found perfect love
That one of a kind most dream of
I never though it could be
But in you I found everything I'll ever need

And saw the handwriting on the wall
Time was passing me by so fast

"To live in this world,
You've got to believe in yourself." (believe in yourself)

I am Somebody, somebody
And the Universe is mine

and all the ways you were broken hearted
I take a trip everyday in my mind.

I see your face I recall it few words
It's playing back like a broken record
I remember every tear in your eyes
If I knew what I know
I'd walk back in time
I would right every wrong ooh
I would change every line
Then you'd be here right now
Just like yesterday
But you'd feel no more doubt
when you hear me say

You're the only one I want
You're the only one yeah
You're the ony one I need in my life (in my life baby)
You're the only one I love (I love love love you)
You're the only one I need in my life oooh yeah

When I first held your hand and we started to dance
I had this awesome crush on you
Hoping deep down inside that you wanted me too

And now we're here together
Preparing ourselves for the future, yeah

So I walk another mile down this crooked road
Clouds rolling in Lord it's getting cold
Feeling fine
Feel lost feeling blue tonight
But my only friend is Mr. Moonlight
Then I see you girl lost in your book of poems
You're in another world
I should leave you alone
My heart races on I try and hold it back

But like a runaway train I'm about to jump the tracks
Now you say you need a friend
I swear to you if that's what you need
That's what I'll be
But I hope this never ends
I feel there's something more the way
You look at me
...

Now i slowly look around this room
And i think about the times i spent with you
I tried to satisfy my restless heart
but each road i took left me in the dark
It takes a special love to give in and just let go
And you understood and set me free
You gave me everything i need and now
that i can finally see you Know

(chours)
I love you, your the only one that could

Two hearts beating as one

When love has just begun
So many promises
You and I take a vow
To make the most of love
Make the most of love right now
I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)

Endlessly
How long will I love you?
Endlessly
How long will I care?
