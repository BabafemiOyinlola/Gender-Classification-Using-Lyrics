Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes... (Brick City)

(Pos)
Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin for crime, halt! Who goes there?

(Dove)
Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

(Pos)
While we rockin it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

Chorus One: Redman

God bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall
It go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click
It went - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!

(Pos)
It ain't my fault your ass is on the ashphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
Man, my topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin is the past drug
A life filled with (*TWEET*) that's what thugs love

the thangs you want to know when you look at me
god knows i done been through and paid my dues
can't change how you feel, cause it's - all on you-whoahhha-ohhh-yeah
I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
weigh the situation how you want (right)
the lovin that you claim is just a four letter word
the third letter's invitin so visualize the verb
you curve thoughtways when you're handlin the candleabra
so you sittin on the baby grand
transmittin like you're made of man
but you paint a funny face like a chick

Groove wit the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say

We bout to place you in that +3 Feet+ of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta +Hey Love+ all the honies cause they're short term

For the brother he's a nigga when he packs it

Erotic...

Awwwwwwwwww... baby!

Verse 1

Access to her cove, lovestruck dove is dove's mode
Took a look, dropped my books, jenifa, oh jenny
Breakfast was our greetings, yoghurts and birdseed's what I fed
Slipped a note, "rock my yacht, jenifa, oh jenny"
Jenny only thought about jimmy, but didn't think about derwin
The jimmy who's only a virgin
Steady we go, jenifa led, pluggin' a tune which freedom well said
So what's the fix, o jenifa, can a brother with soul get swingin'?

A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon

Excuse me, junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light, what a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway push couldn't shove me
To understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms relievers
And believers will walk to it
Then even talk to it and say

Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the day-glo
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
"i got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number

But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's harry, dick, and tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Saturday, it's a Saturday
It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh, tough luck, 'cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text

In the Big Blue, in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock Jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'Cause now in the hood he's 'Johnny The Fox'

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues

Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date
Padlock Jody's screaming, "Wait, wait, wait"
"Don't worry, hon," he replies, "I'm keepin' the faith"

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
'Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?

to reading credits, we them medics
alphabetically stuck on that english
And knock it out before we pour
that sure shot more rock co.kane flow

[MF Doom]
From the top of the key, the 3 Villain
Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn
Turn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar
Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar
Ya heard? Holla - broad or dude, we leave food

Oh tough luck, 'cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text
In the Big Blue in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning

Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks

Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news

Or is it just my De La song?

A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon

Excuse me, junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light, what a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway push couldn't shove me
To understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms relievers
And believers will walk to it

You wanna call me up? Take my number down

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday

It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then let's go, hit his way

Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday

He had daisies in his hat, so I stopped him for a while
He delivered me a message, a massage to soothe my stage

Conversation drew a rule,
Which the crowd will roar by millions
Mr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look
For now the villains try to hold you underwater
But one thing we all must heed
Sony Walkmans keep us walking
De La Soul can help you breathe when you tread water'

In a flash I saw commotion
There was movement in these ferns
Silently the silence came, was it the end of my world?

Show time is enough when the Soul is performing

Coping with dates in clubs, can't even lounge
Lounge with the homeboys how we are copin'
Scoping new material for Paul to plug high-pitched
High-pitched what Paul plugs in and still scopin'

Bearer of beautiful views to express the peace
Peaceful expressions why we are bearers
What the Soul tries to project is when existing in rap
You're living in a full time era

It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

(Eye know Eye love you better)

DOVE:
May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
They name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice

And who's the foot? I'm the foot. But, who's steppin'?

Skirts play with it 'cause I'm slick like that

Watch the way I say it:

She was a winner of my metaphor and she knew that

She used to have a man wit lots of mad signs
Her strut was guaranteed to make a gay smile

Verse 1

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
the pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
Product of a North Carolina cat
who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
and didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
look ma, no protection
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
so the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black
so the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen
from a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
(And that'll be sometime soon)
Faker than a fist of kids
speakin that they're black
When they're just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied
and said "We'll be natives to the end"
Nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now

Life

This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin'
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts

Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You from the same type of people try to hold you down
Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things

Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring? I tell you for me
It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin'
Cats posin' as my fan just to get grabbin' what's mine

I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found around
Kids who can't afford thinkin' caps
But always found drinkin' raps and eatin' off beats
Claimin' laws of the streets, but who made the laws?
Everybody playin' 'rebel' with no sign of a 'cause'

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down just to be down

A noble job at Feni, money ain't everything
But everything makes me want it

But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers
Act like game on the dice on the mic device
Stay above middle class for life
Not an easy task but I've grown to love it

Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin
While I speak to my mens about the world problems
And girl problems with no immediate way to solve 'em?
But I'm on hits

I make the best of the life I be with it
Making the most of the moment among the livin'
And it feels good being the man that I want to be

Do what I can 'cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Now I'm asking am I worthy of you, of you

Uh uh uh
Everywhere I go (What happens)
People ask me (What, what)
Yo dealer, you smoke weed (No doubt)
And I just tell em' YEAH!
Two weeks later, they smokin' weed
That's what I'm talkin' about
I ain't here to tell you not to smoke weed
Everybody get high
I'm here to apply the pressure
You, you, you and you
You and you (Especially you)
Come down to the den
I got some shit that'll blow ya mind

Come here my peer, let me apply the pressure, the pressure
Come here my peer, let me apply the pressure, the pressure

Yo, what up my nigga (Yeah, what up with your world)
Ain't shit, just got off the cell with this girl (So far)
Yeah B you know what we about to do (What the hey)
Come on nigga puff it too, yeah right

Honey draws bees like dookie draws flies
Just like the weed draws me to get high
Now I'm not tryin' to bend ya arm
I just want you to take a hit off the bong
That's all (Just one hit man)

Come on cool it, I'm not foolish
Quit pullin' my leg baitin' me like cob
My name ain't Craig and I ain't lost my job
Don't mind be odd from out the bunch
And y'all cornerin' me ain't stoppin' me from doin' it
(If puffin' so bad, why everybody doin' it)
Man everybody doin' it (Yo come take a puff, style is real)

Let it take ya whole style and feed it
(Go ahead with that man)

I got the funk to blow ya mind (Blow ya mind)
I got some shit to blow ya mind (Blow ya mind, blow ya mind)

(intro: A friend's voicemail to Dave)
Dave, whattup man?
It's me
Umm. just callin to see, if possible, if you have any
time today or within the next couple of days
If, if, you're in the studio. or if you're at home. or car, whatever
That song. that. it's called trying or something, Mase
was tellin me that I needed to hear?
He said it was amazing
Whoo. the way he was talkin. man I wanna hear it!

(Dave)
Am I just another lost in the pack?
We for shack ship, you know laugh it off
Years just blow by
My eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus
I cry a lot but admit to it
Enjoyin life now but I've been through it
Sometimes I wish that I can go back
No bills no kids just getting tore back
I want a wife, I love women
How could I front like I don't be in love wit em?
A li'l man that I can teach
A li'l sand but not the beach
I figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin
So when I'm gone, make sure the head stone reads, "He did it for us"
I'm like your modern day Jesus
I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose
And float soft kisses to my baby
(yo ain't that Dave's little girl?)
Yeah, respect her for that
She gon be somebody
Instead of somebody-baby-mama
You see young minds are now made of armor
I'm tryin to pop a hole in your Yankee cap
Absorb me
The skies over your head aint safe no more
And Hip Hop aint your own
And if it is then you fuckin up the crib son
You make life look like I don't wanna live one
You might as well hold your breath until you die in a
corner somewhere bent over in the crevice
This God Theory overcomes the worst of weathers
As long as you willin to try, you on a good start homie
. you on a good start. see nigga tryin

You know the club, Maseo was rockin rub that night
Midnight to four, name at the door
but the whole crew I can get in as well
So I got on my cell, called my nigga C. Smith
Let this be a jam that we need not miss
"Yeah I'm already en route," no doubt
Might even jump up on the mic
to make sure that this party's turned out
And we some punctual types, on time, look for the line
to stand we find girls screamin the blues
Miscellaneous shoes everywhere
"Yo Mase, what happened here?"
("Go Brooklyn!") Yo Brooklyn, y'all know the rules
Bump? people and out come the tools
Ain't been a fair fight since the creation of crews
and that's why them dudes hearts all pumped
Done closed the club down,
cause one of they niggaz got jumped

Uh-huh, you heard the hook
No matter you Braveheart or shook
You can catch a bottle from the right, tap to the left

Chorus: all
If you can dig it, deal with it, if you can't, just forget it
Cause nobody rocks the party like we
Get loose, get loose, sunshine get loose
Just rock, and show 'em you got juice
And have, have, have, have, have, have, have fuuuuuuun!
Verse 1: la sunshine
I know it's been a while since the last time
You're heard la sunshine pick up the microphone and rhyme
But now I think it's time to go for mine
So you can sit back, relax, just max and unwind
Because it's time for me to out a few heads to bed
Because I'm upset at what somebody said
I've heard it through the grapevine it's been said
That sunshine, can't rhyme?
Ha! that's the funniest line that I heard in a long time
The wanna be me's that they I sound off beat
I'm not off beat, I'm totally unique and it sounds real sweet
So if you're ready, get set for a trip to the sun
You'll be guided, and I've decided to become
One to take total control of your soul
Young or all be bold because it's a sight to behold
Chorus:
Sticks and stones might break your bones but pos is gonna blow your mind
Ain't no need to hold it (let it go!) just one more time!
Verse 2: posdnuos
Now you can bet that I'm first kick a watt
Soul son, plug one, posdnuos I'm top notch
Forward, backstep, got cabbage on the brain
So I'm leafy, peasy, and I act kind of sane
So homeboys and girls just come follow me
I'm the fried pipe piper down with dub and plug three
I like my mans, freestyle is not my flow
But I gets mad respect from norfolk to glasgow
I run this up to court about a minute to the sec
Cause my hoodie won't clash with whipper whip's mockneck
So my hip-hop teachers please show me the math
And after this give me your goddamn autograph
Chorus:
Whipper whip, you can make the microphone sing
Walking around sporting your diamond ring
All the ladies know you as an mc king
So get on the mic and tell 'em it ain't no thing
Verse 3: whipper whip
Well the prince is my title and, I do what I must do
When rappers get beside themselves, that's when I bust two
Or three, see it doesn't matter to me
Cause the w-h-i-p's got an army
Whipper whip, the whipster, money gripster

Got a way with women, so I get away with yours

Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated

Mummy you can play your ripley's
Or believe it or not

Prescribin' your vibe, love,

But a government rate can't settle for no nickels
Even pennies for thought for short

Be some brothers from the east with some beats that be thorough
Got the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it
I gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets
Gun control means using both hands in my land
Where it's all about the cautious livin'
Migrating to a higher form of consequence, compliments
Of strugglin', that shouldn't be notable,
Man every word I say should be a hip hop quotable.

Cocaine and crack
Which brings sickness to blacks,

And, and bass up the track a little bit
'Cuz I, I'm here I wanna hear that boom bish boom, knowhatI'msayin'?

Yeah, yeah, you know the bizness
Common Sense, soul with the De La
Get all them playas
We the rhyme sayers

Huh and that's the bizness, hah
Gonna do it like this
Gettin' it hot
Like the Chicago streets

I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high
Always exhale the facts 'cause I don't inhale lie
Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my losses
So I can earn the acres, the houses, yeah, the horses

Of course, it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex, EFX be live like Das
Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos

And never flaunt the coin 'cuz dime-getters be gazin'
They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so amazin'
I'm fazin' those who're supposed to have the last laughter
'Cuz even when I'm gone, I'm reappearin' in the after

I haveta send respects to real money makers
Do not connect us with those champaign sippin' money fakers
Taste the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town
Now what that prove, you're so full, you can't even move

'Cause I'm the D to the O, the V to the E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
Well I'm the P L U, the G to the One
Walk around the planet earth, making money, having fun

And I'm the C to the O, double M O N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
I'm the C to the O, double M O N
I sit and think with a drink

Do you wanna be a MC? Or do you wanna serve?
Do you wanna be dope? Or do you wanna deal it?
Fabricated acrylic, I feel it, I'm the style molester
I do a show, get Extra P's like the Large Professor

In fact I get more hoes than Tessa, peep game like a
Refa-ree in soul control of my
Destiny, in the best of three out of five

Fresh from a bible belt town
That's what she's givin' up
Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a greyhound
Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm
Hides that he is a shark
Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home
That's what he wanna do
She just wanna new zip code for an old dream
Lost in an appetite now the big apple might
Find her habit of a queen
Feel the negro that's filled with an equal match road
Destination unknown
She's Little Bow Peep
And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn
Now the wolf give a push
Now watch her jump in with two feet
Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs
Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her
Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines
Go fast with the fast life so she needs more
One fun fix, now a daily chore
Provide the score, written and produced so perverse
He's a pro well versed
Told her that the purse that she want
With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid
Can be earned with speed in a day
Escort on the high class side
Champagne glass rides
White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies
When you're flyin', crash and burn
She learned that her soul was dyin'
That's worth savin'

Nothing like a tall six-foot-five woman

Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear

So let me be, to do what I want
To do what I like

This "Art Official" will keep your shoes moonwalkin
Soon to talk about, "Pop Music"

Held back in rotation, an apple a day

Yo, who hold guns and rock ice bigger than life
Got bitches throwin' they drawers on stage, that ain't me
I raise kids, push whips, piss an MC
Love money like I love my moms

Love my nigga Com Sense
When he bang dents all up in they wallets
Wall to wall bullshit, I got hardwood floors
Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine
So y'all are fuckin' the same hoes who used to be mine

And I've been waitin' three summers to rhyme alongside my people
Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal
Dose of hop hippin' if you thought CaTash was slippin'
Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sippin'
CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize
Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

Yo, you better recognize and try to analyze this
Hand over fist, how can a man act like a bitch?
Change and switch, snitch on his crew
Yo, get rid of the niggaz before the same thing happen to you

And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue
Blood leakin' out, girls freakin' out
Motherfuckin' cops tweakin' out
Got you on your knees like a freak

Jugglin' deez nuts smugglin' these cuts from S.C.
You best believe there's no web or weave a net
We done swallowed 40 bottles of threat

Yo, what you know about my writes?
What you know about what's weak, what's tight?
And what you know about an off night?
What you know about niggaz frontin' for the light?

And what you know about them gun fights?
Got a nigga duckin' while them girls show fright
And what you know about my writes?
Ah, what you know about my writes?

Yeah, yeah, look, I'm Samson without Delilah, the soul survivor
The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake
Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol

The same shit she was screamin since the year before
Ever since the de la soul video, she seen me on the tv
Heard that she was holdin a grudge and tryin to see me
Workin underground circuits and mad cyphers of people
When she asked who was ill, all she got was indeed
She wanna battle (what? ) and it wasn't hard to tell

I initiate the buddy with a slap

Q-TIP:
Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (Ooh Wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch

Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name (uh)

Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the day-glo
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
"i got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's harry, dick, and tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope

Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
'Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh, tough luck, 'cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text

In the Big Blue, in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock Jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'Cause now in the hood he's 'Johnny The Fox'

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues

Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date
Padlock Jody's screaming, "Wait, wait, wait"
"Don't worry, hon," he replies, "I'm keepin' the faith"

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
'Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?

Crystal carrying pixie peasants and warriors
Elders, ancestors, sons and daughters
Lion hearted kings and everything in between
Take a seat, be witness

You consider 'em king, about to icing on cakes
Chariots cruise at tortoise speeds
Lay your bifocals on royalty
Longer than Sears catalogue
Stern like matadors and (?) LPs
Mirror the crimson tide

But coozy up to this warmth though

Yo, a slow burn we are
Last long three-man act to wake up your thermostat
Blind through the property line
Creative minds crossover and back
Scribble with a knife to earn that slice of life
Cock back, aim, shot the name wherever the price is right
The pain earned is the pain learned, and heads talking like burn
Connect (to the same as it ever was)
Respect the land cause it never floods and well irrigated
Looking for my vanity, it's there, the mirror hate it
And stated, stop being an MC and give your verses more weight
By being just M-E, thoughts are oxidized when I spit em out
And my lungs prefer tastes, encrypted words laced to get them out home
With removal service to get kings out the throne
(More hands on) With hands upon the neck
Of a voice magnifier over decks
The sound is found at the youngs in the batch
Lovely how I let my mind float
You can catch me in the early morning
Find me up with no yawning
Haven't been asleep, I'm on cue
8 in the corner pocket from the booth all 24 hours like it was our debut
Life edited my etiquette
Dreams beyond your eons
You can't wait this out
Start blitz, starring it's that crew who never call the splits convey lines made from outer spines
So the nerve of us to be so damned crush
Grit like JDL and we sip from the grail
Where the current course connects, so we're not unsung
Just vets, this mission's undone

We will not recognize this place
The dollar store is filled with love
The parking lot is full of grace
Now, judges put their snoopies on
With glorious and true restraint
A child is gonna rule them all
Said the prophets of the human race

Hey now, can you picture yourself
Hey now, in the physical sense
Hey now, a subcutaneous thing
Hey now, like a mother and father

Pan Am trips, circa 76, the Ritz
Papa hit the belt, to pick up at the JFK
I judge nothing, I let her know, AFK
I'm off the front porch and the front screen
Two shocks on my back, the wise look mean
They told me slow down, baby, but I'm a lummox

Move like sloth, cut cloth with new scissors
You thinking too big, I call Nell Carter

Fresh from a bible belt town
That's what she's givin' up
Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a greyhound
Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm
Hides that he is a shark
Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home
That's what he wanna do
She just wanna new zip code for an old dream
Lost in an appetite now the big apple might
Find her habit of a queen
Feel the negro that's filled with an equal match road
Destination unknown
She's Little Bow Peep
And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn
Now the wolf give a push
Now watch her jump in with two feet
Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs
Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her
Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines
Go fast with the fast life so she needs more
One fun fix, now a daily chore
Provide the score, written and produced so perverse
He's a pro well versed
Told her that the purse that she want
With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid
Can be earned with speed in a day
Escort on the high class side
Champagne glass rides
White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies
When you're flyin', crash and burn
She learned that her soul was dyin'
That's worth savin'

You've got so many different flavors
You've got so many different types

Can't go wrong with that
Knowing how to cook a good twenty-two pound ham
Whooty-who
Nothing like a tall six-foot-five woman
For a short man like me
To fill up a good waterbed
I'm only sixty-seven
I still got lot more time to find the right one
And you do need to find the right one

Keep heads up like nosebleed

Plug signs on the jackets
Give props, yo, like a Prop Joe package
It's illegal
How those kids can come from out of the slums and live so regal
Lose it all on a prayer to the ego
Before the loss we earn for the cause
Toast to the life though my liver won't endorse
Currently in time and my enzymes
Are in sync to digest the brink of armageddon
The bedding's over the mattress we lay with the actress
For social media to swallow us
Watch them rap peers who don't reply back
Cause they think we gon' snatch up their Twitter followers
That's some female type foolery
And your females like glue to it
She know it, the scent of a poet
Police buy restraint to cover all the angles
A nopera of operations
See one got all you in your crew all confident with courage
We'll be there jumping your square record
You be like "check it, they stretched the shit into rectangles, damn!"

Dance, freak, get out your seat
Show me that you is a real whoodeeni

You gots to gimme gimme mine cause I'm heavy when I weigh it
Watch the way I say it (ego trip)
Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up

Lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook

Breakfast, broke it fast
She was in my english class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat

Lost her favourite penny
So I gave her a dollar
She kissed me

Jenny grabbed on to my hand
Took me home and said, trugoy just

Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh, tough luck, 'cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text

In the Big Blue, in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock Jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'Cause now in the hood he's 'Johnny The Fox'

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues

Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date
Padlock Jody's screaming, "Wait, wait, wait"
"Don't worry, hon," he replies, "I'm keepin' the faith"

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
'Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?

No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'Cause now in the hood he's 'Johnny The Fox'

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues

Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date
Padlock Jody's screaming, "Wait, wait, wait"
"Don't worry, hon," he replies, "I'm keepin' the faith"

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
'Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?

I wish that you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want

The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb

You curve thought ways when you're handlin' the candelabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that, uhh

Surfin' on a curb from inception of a set-up
Planet in black granite, halos above it
The autopsy can't top me, beloved
Dissect survival, passed on a whisper
Placed on the mother who shunned, now it's the
Boys who shot joy inside the violent

Feat. The Spirit Of The Wu

And like the Wu we bring it to you in the purest form
We reside far away from the norms
Small from the big catch, the big bang, big break
Fetch patch and pins even with the pencil
Rap labels study us, flooded us with stencil
That's tense in town, murder your display
And we stay flying even with the terrorist flying
This to that time, monitor the pat down
Searching for control substance with sustenance
We administer the drug ever since day broke
Covers grow, pots green, balloons
The black shirt saying stakes elevate at noon
AOR grind, you hear it, understand, we steer it
Some chose to veer it off the course, the main source missing
You pay no dues, you earn no pension
Learn the rules, you can either be the pimp or the pimped out tools

Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue

Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos

Wears just a larger pound

And when I quest for the buddy, I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothing but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out the jimmy and see what we can catch

Next won't be needed unless (jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

Yes, this is Miss Renee King from Philadelphia. 
I want you to give me a call on area code 215-222-4209 
and I'm calling in reference to the music business. 
Thank you."


Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
"I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I gotta answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves

Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh tough luck, 'cause it makes jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text
In the big blue in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14k'd
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'cause now in the hood he's

Till one ring came, jody blew a park
Found about jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practising the range, bellowing the blues
Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
"yo, jody, yo, gotta go, got a date"
Padlock jody's screaming "wait, wait, wait!"
"don't worry, hon," he replies, "i'm keepin' the faith"

The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex, EFX be live like Das

And never flaunt the coin 'cuz dime-getters be gazin'

Verse One: Maseo

It's strong island for real, where the critters run wild
the prefix is 516, the top of the dial
trhough the L.I. Sound, to the villa down under
and across the globe I heard a lot of folks wonderin'
so when's it coming 'cause the stakes is high see big money that waves
don't put the pen to my page
and ain't nothin' wrong with standing still and relaxing
and spendin' some of that cash that Uncle Sam is gonna tax
a New York demeanor is sit back in the beamer
with nothing to lose but some gas and some minutes
ignorin' the gazers 'cause some stars don't get petty
and that trash you talk is just New Years confetti
it's like that y'all, but that's all 'bout to change
like some of my own, people tend to act strange
i'm making a scene, and it's served with it's capabilities
so set it at an island's degrees

Posdanous:

It's strong island for real, the diagnosis is supreme
the prefix is 516, where microphones fiend
the voices that gots the gift, 'cause the world is on their shoulders
makein' plans to switch from little rock to money boulders

my girl stands deep from nubians actin' like Columbians sellin' keys

Said, we was niggas and clowns but it was just love
And plus love showed me that she was a diamond

Findin' out God, took a hit me dead on my heart
And made the eye water start

So wipe your Lottos on the mat

But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me

Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos

Let me lay my hand across yours

Verse 1

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
the pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
Product of a North Carolina cat
who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
and didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
look ma, no protection
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
so the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black
so the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen
from a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
(And that'll be sometime soon)
Faker than a fist of kids
speakin that they're black
When they're just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied
and said "We'll be natives to the end"
Nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now

I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high
Always exhale the facts cause I don't inhale lye/lie

So I can earn the acres (uhh) the houses (yeah) the horses (huh)
Of course it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das
Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos
And never, flaunt the coin cuz dime-getters be gazin
They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin
I'm fazin those who're supposed to have the last laughter
Cuz even when I'm gone I'm reappearin in the after
I haveta, send respects to real money makers
Do not connect us with those champaign sippin money fakers
Taste the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town
Now what that prove, you're so full you can't even move

Chorus:

Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies

Well I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One

To Sanctuary Records and Tommy Boy Music, you've been left with
Free reign to conduct business as you see fit. Your mission
If you so choose, is to continue to do what you do best - hip-hop
This tape will self-destruct in five seconds."
Making cash steady's on everybody's mind
DJ's spinning on songs now declined
Rap is fast, but rap ain't cool
Hot enough to burn, yet I roll with a firm
That'll put that fire out, lower your temp
Smack you with a banana, little chimp
I'm known to run laps around your BMI and ASCAP
Put me on a tour bus, cover whole map
Leave my organs intact when I die
But please donate every rhyme that I've fried and baked
To them no skill rappers on the make
Who say the same shit, come in the same fit
And I'm wonderful while I'm most wild
Most call me Wonder Why for years

But I know how to pace myself, embrace the wealth
Make time for the dotted line
But when we find some contract, got a con tryin to stab our back
We sever them ties - wash them lies off!
And dry off in the truth
Wonder Why say it, I proofreads
Some speed past and think I won't catch the ink
I don't match with the main word

And it's just a way to get more
Out of America, the land of the wants and needs
Where the flame of greed is hard to put out
So the output is to put yourself first, and worse

Midday may, it's all lovin'
Take a walk down to d dot c

While you searchin for some trick
To put the shit in her name
I be spendin on wall street
And buyin' boardwalk
Dodging problems of the world

There's a lot of people out here
Who just don't know
What plays a factor
In movin' heads and toes
It be them hits
Hangin' out of them stereo kits
Whether cassette radio or cd bits
Mix tapes from the best
Going on and on
Throughout the city grounds
To suburban lawns
Man, we don't play
Even where we stay
Videos shows the visuals
Of jams today
Coinciding with the rhythm
Of the heart and neck
The brakes got you
In your proper context
You let your lex or your
Sixty-four suspension
Bounce away all your tension
En route to the club
Where girls need the quenchin'
Diamonds on your wrist
Sunroof top
But niggas out front
Makin' guns go pop
So the spot gets shut
But on to the next
'Cause your ears get vexed
When they don't get the fix cause

(These are the brakes)
It be your listenin pleasure
While you're doin your chores
(These are the brakes)
No matter where you from
It's for you and yours
(These are the brakes)
Bringing it back to the brakes
Like the 'yes yes y'all'
(These are the brakes)
So let it be your anthem
When you're havin' a ball

Rub me up, rub me down, rub me all around (what)
Kiss me here, kiss me there, kiss me, kiss me everywhere!

Verse One: Maseo

It's strong island for real, where the critters run wild
the prefix is 516, the top of the dial
trhough the L.I. Sound, to the villa down under
and across the globe I heard a lot of folks wonderin'
so when's it coming 'cause the stakes is high see big money that waves
don't put the pen to my page
and ain't nothin' wrong with standing still and relaxing
and spendin' some of that cash that Uncle Sam is gonna tax
a New York demeanor is sit back in the beamer
with nothing to lose but some gas and some minutes
ignorin' the gazers 'cause some stars don't get petty
and that trash you talk is just New Years confetti
it's like that y'all, but that's all 'bout to change
like some of my own, people tend to act strange
i'm making a scene, and it's served with it's capabilities
so set it at an island's degrees

Posdanous:

It's strong island for real, the diagnosis is supreme
the prefix is 516, where microphones fiend
the voices that gots the gift, 'cause the world is on their shoulders
makein' plans to switch from little rock to money boulders
the real proceed
my girl stands deep from nubians actin' like Columbians sellin' keys
characters have the tendency to con themselves

Mummy I saw one day
She was on some fume vapors
Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper
Cat litter had me sniffin
Since outside the palace
Eyes sicker than aids
Game harder than a callous
Tried to enter in her shit
She had locks on the session
Tellin me how her last man
Taught her ass a lesson damn
Well, i'm not the mayor
I take care of my dimes
But I excluded I had nickels
Addin' up to her kind
Short stacks with a wristful of jewels

Sayin she didn't need a man
To make her out for a fool
Dig it, miss, my love is credited in cupid account
And if you need that extra help
I got the extra amount
Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humor
Then she broke out with the words
About knowin all the rumors
"See, all you niggas rappin be like pedigree dogs
Thinkin you can have me leashed
Around your microphone cords"
Somethin 'bout her lit me up like july
And with them onions in the pants
I couldn't help but cry

Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh

I shoot gift like heron
With skills of gil-scott
Nights like sir lancelot can get heated
Prescribin' your vibe, love,
I know how you need it

(Chorus): (2x)

I like to mingle sometimes
So I head out of state to find a couple of dimes
But a government rate can't settle for no nickels
Even pennies for thought for short

Remember to keep the Mos Def in the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets

Now, come on y'all, get live get down

So don't none of y'all just be misled
The De La's gonna do the body good like wheat bread

Shakin' laces out of shoes, Mos Def bought the brews
Sittin' Indian squats to make that red tie knots
See I'm out to get the core like in them Rainbow Pops
Swingin' life like a hammock, invested like stocks

Via sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Snappin' by the pain as a crew hear the gain
We remain on your mind like skulls, not a golem
I'ma show it in the house all perimeters are blown

Native Tongue come through to make you say yes yes

Suppose I have my whole life on it
Funny how those you love, love the evil they do

I brew the medicine to heal, a bit of verbals we had
But yo' ideas of heal, is left the surface of it scabbed
Navigations nearly took me on some cruise type expense
Dispensin' me some shitty canal, I took the juice

Because I'm used to one-ways, detours and destinations
Of ways in life, I pretends the knife
Stuck in my spine'll be a symbol, how Jack can B. Nimble
But it's time to make that foggy vision crystal

Yep, yep, big trucker man's rollin' in town
How ya do? How ya do?
I got the joints to make ya... (jump!)
Because I'm headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around
And everybody's talkin' bout your stuff funny
But they're still tellin' lies to me...

I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me
And who's the foot? I'm the foot. But, who's steppin'?
(Ain't no half steppin')
You know where I'm steppin'
Skirts play with it 'cause I'm slick like that
I'm the greatest MC in the world!

You gots to gimme gimme mine, 'cause I'm heavy when I weight it
Watch the way I say it:
"Ego trip"
I change my pitch up, smack my bitch up
But never did it
The flavor's bein' butt, but brothers ain't gettin' it
Get it, or else you're a goner
When I rolls over, ya gonna have to wanna lamp
'Cause it's the chattanooga champ

And since she fancies facial hair she asks my name

She was a winner of my metaphor and she knew that
I said I'm gonna feed your mouth she said you do that

She used to have a man wit lots of mad signs
Her strut was guaranteed to make a gay smile

Verse 1

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
the pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
Product of a North Carolina cat
who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
and didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
look ma, no protection
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
so the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black
so the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen
from a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
(And that'll be sometime soon)
Faker than a fist of kids
speakin that they're black
When they're just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied
and said "We'll be natives to the end"
Nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now

Bootleggers my legs and, grit about a hug
And who gets the Motts, I knots by the chance

Makes makes, is gonna be the new man's motto
Don't increase the bull, because my pulley is broken

It's a second I reckon on the bone and the ball
Makin London bridges fall, so check it
I bring a point to the joints that we change and chop
but we could bring it back to the beatbox!

So some feel free in sayin that we don't hunger for beats
Not that we not hungry, just picky in what we eat
Keep food off the mind and keep weight off the body
All you gotta do is keep my name out your mouth
And stop frownin like you hostile

I hate losin' to those who walk away with my dough

And now she wanna see the resident provokin' me

Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind
Sorry to disappoint, but dis joint's mine

You rush right in to see him do it with a smile
It's Long Isle y'all, longevity sustainin' my celebrity status
From AM to PM, you see him on file y'all

Said, I'm on the car, seen the jiggiest of stars
Become dust, and one love become lust for the papers

Tricked your cash on ice, should a had acres

Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
To sell to all who wanna hear some

Just long as you're not, pussy and be the would-be king
But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down

And I be the world renowned wonder why
Wonderin' why you can't stand me?
Is it because I'm the main Jackson?
And y'all just Titos and Randys? Yes it is
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last

At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin' you how us native tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy, just settin' it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in raggin'
My daughter says I'm a teen, 'cause like a teen
My pants always saggin' and I walk with a bop
The sex part of my time, I walked from my pop
No longer on timey and was never on loud
But cooked rhymes that make the chefs of Wu proud

Watch out dawg, the watchdog's showin' his teeth

While I speak from experience, hunger and hurt
And a little bit of hate from niggaz doin' me dirt
I just wash it all out with tide and show love
To those who ride with me while I'm puttin' in work
Full-timin' it, 8: 30 to 6, the graveyard shift
The three months before the benefits hit
But my position went temp' to perm', I sat and listened
Like an intern watchin' who applied get fired
Now I'm sittin' in the break room, they gotta make room
My paper stacks, put staples through 'em
So I can keep my money together
Some die-hard fans just don't want it like, "Put Pos back on it"
I'm back on it, that's why you never disappointed
We give you what we live through for real
Don't own a crown but I'm royalty
And tryin' to see the royalty checks about a half a mil'
Whether off or on the chart, my cuts grips your heart
You know we got you open like your gut splits apart
I never pass the buck, my shoulder holds the weights
So don't beef when we don't pass collection plates
I don't give money, I don't support the needy
Schooled in America, taught to be greedy
And everythin' ought to be easy
But I never could say goodbye to my friends who get high

Still make him cry when the satire's hilarious

To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar
Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar
Ya heard? Holla - broad or dude, we leave food
Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up

All I is is man and once an embryo
Am I solid gold? I don't cast a glow
Yes I guess it's reflex
Some have no control
I'd rather let a laughter
And tally off I go
Canoeing in the river or out into the O

Some are lovey Dovey ah you crazy crow
Some shake your hand but

Pissed with the witness, and now I adore

Where they arose, well nobody knows
What do they mean, well here's how it goes
Oh shoot's got the O's when you hold the dough
You know who you are but they didn't know

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Saturday, it's a Saturday
It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Man alright
Yo man we have any milk?
Yeah, what time is it?
I don't know, what day is it?
Don't know, well I'll tell you.

Well it was a wednesday
Me and boss hog was kinda hungry
Like two eggs, and a slop beef slice of lettuce
And a glass of milk and some cookies.
Spotted in the mist was a bk logo
What we said - well what do you know
This chick thought I was trying to play fly
Cause I had a pair of blue jeans on.

Young girl, won't you take my order?
She said, "yeah, but right now I'm kinda busy...
Can't you see I'm trying to put this band aid on my finger? "
Lingering, I could tell
She's a b-k mademoiselle
Ripped uniform and bottom bell
And some jelly stuff on her sleeve
Look to this cause I had no name tag on my collar
Could be pissed cause she's clocking 2.45 an hour
And then boss hog hollar
"girl you better make this quick!"
She said, "i ain't your girl and I ain't your chick!"
I had an idea and lickity split
Took my hat off and that was it

Dread locks fallen all over me and then I said
"yeah now we'll see!"
And o' with quick velocity honey was mesmerized
"ain't you that guy? "
"aint you that girl!"

This song does not contain explicit lyrics, but what it does contain
is an udesired element. This element is known as the basehead, the
lowest of lowest of all elements that exist. And the sad thing is,
this particular element... is me brudda!

Brother, brother oh brother of mine
We used to be down as partners in crime
From our parents our name was forged
I was the Beaver, you Curious George
Wanted to dispose of this and that
But curiosity had killed the cat
At this age no wonder it was read
But this was the fate that you were fed
Throughout high school our minds we'd waste
High off all the cheeba that we could taste
Soon you had converted to nasal sports
Every five minutes cocaine you'd snort
Told me that you needed a stronger fix
Stepped to the crack scene in '86
Unlike the other drugs where you had control
This substance had engulfed your body and soul
Now from me you lost all respect
Said yo need to put that shit in check
Wanted me to believe that you had tried
But your mind and the craving had coincided
Said there was a voice inside you that talked
Which said you shouldn't stop but continue to walk
Now the brother who could handle any drug
Had just found the one that could pull his Plug

(Background:)
(Ya don't stop, ya don't, ya don't stop)
(Ya don't stop, the body rock)

"Yo, bro, got another rock for your hiking boots"
"Gonna make you scream and loop three loops"
"Gonna take you far on a freeway, okay"
Remember that day? Slipped me a smile for a 20 crack vial

I will lick your funky emotions"

This is the stylin' for a little that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about triflin' times of Millie
Millie, a Brooklyn Queen-originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hilly-billy
Around this time, the slammin' joint was Milk is Chilin'
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah, I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie become one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dukie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?

And make that shit R&B, rap and bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin?
Or make that shit funk
Fuck that, this is MCin right here, this is hip-hop

And like the Wu we bring it to you in the purest form
We reside far away from the norms
Spawn from the big catch, big bang, big breaks
Fetch pads and pens, even with the pencil
Rap labels studied us, flooded us with stencil
That's tinseltown, murder your display
And we stay flying even with the terrorists' trying
This to that town, monitor the pat down
Searching for controlled substance with sustenance
We inventors of the drug, ever since
Day-glo covers, broke pots, green balloons
The black shirt saying stakes, elevated noon
AOI, grind, you hear it
Understand we steer it
Some choose to veer it off the course
The main source missing
You've paid no dues, you've earned no pension
Learn the rules! You can either be the pimp
