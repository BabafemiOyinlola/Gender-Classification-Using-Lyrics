******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
When I'm looking at you I keep thinking
Why can't she be like you, so I'm scheming
I can't go on like this
Believing that her love is true, oh

Standing on the dance floor while she's trickin'
You are all I want girl, she's a chicken
We might be together, but love is missing
Girl I want you, so what can we do, oh

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Now she's looking at me, but keep talking
Oh, now she's trying to ice you, let's start walking
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Baby, I've been thinking about our love
And thought maybe we could spend a little time
Because lately the moments that we share have been so shaky
You're still here, but you're not here, oh girl

Girl, you've been away too long
Won't you come home, come home
I been missing you since you've been gone
Won't you come home, come home

Now you said that you need a change of pace
And so I said we both could use a little space
Never thinking a little while would be forever
Without your love, without your love

When I'm inside of you
Every time I hear you say my name
Scream and moan

Can't stop ('cause it's getting)
Too hot (all the freaky things you)

Dancing with her friend, but looking at me
And if I'm not mistaken this is an invitation
To participate with me, she and she, oh yeah

And now they're waiting for me
But they'll wait a little longer
I played it oh so pimply
'Cuz I might see something better
And I'll just slide in between 'em
I gotta let these shorties know
I'mma holla at you later
But right now I got's to flow, I got's to flow

Everybody get down
DJ start to get busy
Everybody get loud
Ladies start to get freaky
Niggas startin' to act wild
Let me know if you're with me
Everybody get down
(Work that thang)

Just like I thought, the night keeps getting better
I sees this honey, too hot to miss
She was sitting in a chair with her legs slightly spread
Showing just how off the chain she is, yeah

Yo, yo, yo
This is some of that old futuristic Mr. Spacely type shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on
Talk about it

Hey shorty, love, what the deal, yo?
Let me hit that on the low low
Don't tell your friends, that's a no-no
Cuz if she knows, she's gon' wanna go home with me
Riding this nigga like you're suppose to be
All up on me, like bonin' me
But enough about her, see me in 10 minutes
In 30, I'm up in it cuz

I'mma put it on you until you can't get enough
I'mma work your body until you can't get enough
I'mma kiss the kitty until you can't get enough
Is that enough (It's not enough)

Shaking in the club, making it all wet
Sitting on my lap, knowing we just met
Ooh girl, why you wanna go and do that?
Do what? Do that, why you wanna do that?

Frontin' in the club, making it all wet
Sitting on my lap, playing hard to get
Ooh girl, why you wanna go and do that?
Do what? Do that, why you wanna do that?

She's sexually teasing me, standing too close to me
Whispering things to me just to get my attention
And she's thinking it's just a game, fake numbers and made up names
Promising freaky things but she's got no intentions

She says she just wanna have fun so
She keeps leading me on
Not knowing I ain't the one
Still she keeps on

Shaking in the club, making it all wet
Sitting on my lap, knowing we just met
Ooh girl, why you wanna go and do that?
Do what? Do that, why you wanna do that?

So I'll play along with her scheme until she comes near my cream

I've heard it all
But I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

Lipstick, hair weaves, and toe nails
A hotel lobby full of females
And though I can't give you all the details
I still remember
Some particular shorty on a certain night
She was specifically standing over to my right
She's GHETTOFABULOUS, and I'm sure
If I tried to take her home with me she'd say

Let's do this

Think it's time to say goodbye to our company
Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company
I don't wanna wait any longer, yeah

Some friends came by to kick it
But the time is passing slow
We've wined and dined for half the night
We told every joke that we know

Now I don't mind entertaining
But your body language is telling me
Along with your bedroom eyes
Feels like it's time for them to leave now

It's getting late and I don't want them to stay
They don't have to go home
But they gotta get up, get out and get on

Think it's time to say goodbye to our company

Chorus

Let's cuddle up
I'll wrap my arms around your waist
And lie down naked by the fireplace
On a bearskin rug
We can make sweet love
And then, snuggle up
We don't need no sheets tonite
Just your body laying next to mine
Is that all right?
Lady, let's cuddle up

Verse 1

I wanna feel your body
From head to toe
Give you everything
You've been waiting on
And you won't be disappointed
Wait and see

Hey, baby
What do you do
When I'm not there
Question been on my mind
Letting you know I'm coming
But before I get there
Tell me, do you
Do you play the music low
And burn your candles
Do you touch yourself
Pretending that you're me
Do you think of me
With toys and things inside you
Do you wish your hands
Were my hand

Come here
Come here
So what we gon' do?
You down
I know
Let's do this, ok?
Let's do this
Don't say no, don't say no, don't say no

Here we are again, in this bed again
Making love again, afraid to let it end
The sex seems better when we've had an argument
But you're not leaving and I'm not leaving
So let's do what we came to do
Even though last night

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
What time is it?
Oh, no, oh, no

7 a.m., when reality sets in
See, last night we said and did some things
That we shouldn'ta did
I know the morning after's always harder

Than the night before, for sure
Now we're lying here
Trying to figure what we're suppose to do
We're both wondering if we're getting back together

Or I'm leaving you
We had one drink too many, one kiss too many
One, no don't you say another word, too many
And it led us to the morning after

Last night when the love was too strong
We couldn't fight it and you stayed, just a little too long
So for now it's morning and yesterday's gone
But can we move on?

We ask ourselves, why, oh, why, a thousand times
Yeah, and separately, silently in our heads
We rehearse the lines, I had a nice time
(So did I)

I gotta go now

Keepin' your nights warm whether you're playin' or layin'

In the studio tonight I've got Montell Jordan
How ya doing baby?

[MJ] I'm doin' great, how are you this evening?
[Girl] I'm wonderful now that you're here
It's so nice to see you
Now, you're working on your fourth album

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Well here is my story that I tell to you
You may not believe me but I swear it's true
I escaped to Havana for a getaway
In a tiny club with a cuban band on a Saturday

And that's when I saw her from across the room
Like something from a movie or a storybook
She had a short dress with curly hair and chocolate skin
That's how it all began

1 - I remember when she came into my life
And all at once-upon-a-time
Love was in the air
Just like an ocean breeze
And we were dancing to the sweetest melodies
I held her in my arms until she danced into the night
It happened all at once-upon-a-time
Once upon a time

{Girl} Hifuela mijo tell me what happened next

The next day I was walking to the marketplace
I passed by the cathedral so I stopped to pray
I imagined this journey without my friend
And just like an angel she appeared again
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, you
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
Girl we shared the laughter and the pain
We even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

1 - Take a look at me now
There is just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just a memory of your face

Take a look at me now
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Uhhhhhh
You like that, huh?
Remember me?
Let's get roudy
Let's ride
Yeah, yeah
Yo, Montell when you walk
They be goin' to the lobby ya'll
Tell the bellman I need some more towels up here
When you see shorty?
The one that's sittin on them 20's?
Tell him in 504 she's still 'bout me, you heard?
Let's get roudy

You know Montell's 'bout it, 'bout it
Master P's 'bout it, 'bout it

Stepped in the club
After my show
You know the spot
Where everybody's on the low low
That's when I saw her
She saw me
She told me she like Master P
And Montell occassionally
So I laid back
Put a $50 in my mouth
Said I wanna see you shake it girl
Cuz that's what that 'bout it, 'bout it's about
All the nigga's in the club
Was jealous of me
Cuz I waited for it and I stayed for
And I'm damn near 'bout to pay for it
So

Let's ride
All night
I don't doubt it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I'm so excited

[Intro]
Yeah
Number five y'all
I'm almost a veteran, heh
Don't think I've ever seen you so good lookin'

Since 1995, I've been flowin' on tracks like this
Got a lot of gold and platinum plaques like this
But I had it up to here, so I'm R&B, bangin' on wax like this
In case you forgot, five times on the streets, I been keepin' it hot
Got your shorty on the block singin' da-da-da-da
And I coulda held back, but will I do that?
Probably not

See I represent Cali and it be's like that
And I'll probably get sampled cuz the track's so phat
The music in the street's gotten out of control
You can't keep a deal unless you're platinum or gold
That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more
Mr. Nice Guy come to even the score
And I'm not holdin' my tongue
Girl you know my name and you know where I'm from
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
You're the right one
Right one i let get away
Ooh girl, now what can i say?
To get back into your happy days
You're the right one
Right one, what was wrong with me?
Missin' all that taddy
Promise me you'll save me some
Cuz baby
I haven't seen you in a while
By the looks of your profile
Say it's been a year or more
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Oh yeah, yeah
Mmm
Mmm, mm-hmm
Oh, oh
Damn

Must've been C-R-A-Z-Y
We got all out of sync and went bye bye bye
Not too long ago, you was mine mine mine
Seems like yesterday (yesterday)
Ninety on the freeway, pushin' my ride
Heard you got engaged and I'm losin' my mind
Ask myself the question, why why why
Why'd I let you get away from me?

Well you must've been, thinkin' I'm a jerk
Cryin' out to God, tryin' to make this work
Girl you must've been, stayin' with a fool
Loving somebody that could be so cruel
Well you must've been, packin' your bags
Silly of me, I couldn't see the red flag
Girl I'm sure that (sure that) you must have been
Sick and tired of me

The Story of a lonely man
Flipping channels on my T.V.
Just trying to watch anyone
Who's a little worser off than me
I'm still paralyzed by the news
I couldn't recognize all your clues
If I had walked a mile in your shoes
Well maybe then I'd understand
How you came to hate me so much
Can't remember when I held you last
Said I love you
Or felt your touch
And it's a shame that she nearly died
That woman that you kept inside
You can set her free
but please don't leave

Chorus

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Hey baby, I like it when you're next to me
With that body horizontally
Your pretty legs comfortable in my bed
In your lingerie with my pillow under your head

And honey I like you 'cuz you trust in me
Just so glad to have you on my team
So I'll keep it real with you
Girl, I'm feelin' you, layin' here

Layin' next to you at night
Kissin' and holdin' you tight
All of these things I like
Girl you are mine, mine, mine

You got a lot of sex appeal
I love the way you make me feel
And what I feel is real
Girl, you're one of a kind

Miscellaneous

See
Niggas think this love stuff is easy
Heh, it's not the case

Fallin' in love is so easy
But stayin' that way is so hard
All she wanted was security
A man with a job and a car, baby
You'd think I oughtta be happy
On a hill with a view of the stars
But as soon as I had to go out of town for a week
I went to the next woman's arms

- If I coulda seen it, inside her
Woulda seen her broken heart
I woulda held on, tighter
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Girl I've got a question, here it is
How much longer 'til you let me taste your lips?
You can make a nigga wait if that's your thing
But anticipation drivin' me insane

I'm losing my composure
Tryin' to keep my cool
You start me, then you stop me
So what am I supposed to do?
Sometimes you be actin' so scared
When you know in my heart that I care

1 - Why can't we, just get past the smalltalk and formalities?
Wanna tell you that I want you, but it seems so hard
To let down my guard, and reveal my cards
Your body's convincin' me, so why can't we?
Get right to the foreplay, and right now we'll be
Got me dippin' in your ocean, did I go to deep?
I'm just tryin' to see, baby why can't we?

Listen
Shh.

Can you hear that?
Listen

Ohh, ohh, ohh

Lying in my bedroom next to me
Nervous like a child playing hide and seek
I never knew how fast that your heart could beat
It's like it's your first time

But now that your intentions have been revealed
You wanna feel what lovers feel
There's no need to pretend if you don't know how
I'm gonna show you now

1 - Just say what you're feeling
Your secret is safe with me

VERSE 1
I know I've spent my whole life running from you
Even though there's been some things you needed me to do
I did it my way and hurt you over and over again
But you were preparing me
To carry out your plan
Though you said that you'd walk with me, some won't believe
Cause the messenger you chose sings R&B
So the man that you rescued me from is the man that they still
And I don't know what to say
I need you to speak for me

CHORUS
So Lord, this is my prayer
Your “work in progress” humbly asks of thee
Once your promise is fulfilled, the world will be watching anxiously
Lord help someone to see, the YOU in ME
Lord help just one to see, the YOU in ME

Someone listening right now needs to hear this tonight
Cause you're lonely and there's an emptiness you're trying to fill in your life

Now we're lying here
Trying to figure what we're suppose to do
We're both wondering if we're getting back together

Or I'm leaving you
We had one drink too many, one kiss too many
One, no don't you say another word, too many
And it led us to the morning after

Last night when the love was too strong
We couldn't fight it and you stayed, just a little too long
So for now it's morning and yesterday's gone
But can we move on?

We ask ourselves, why, oh, why, a thousand times
Yeah, and separately, silently in our heads
We rehearse the lines, I had a nice time
(So did I)

I gotta go now

Well here is my story that I tell to you
You may not believe me but I swear it's true
I escaped to Havana for a getaway
In a tiny club with a cuban band on a Saturday

And that's when I saw her from across the room
Like something from a movie or a storybook
She had a short dress with curly hair and chocolate skin
That's how it all began

1 - I remember when she came into my life
And all at once-upon-a-time
Love was in the air
Just like an ocean breeze
And we were dancing to the sweetest melodies
I held her in my arms until she danced into the night
It happened all at once-upon-a-time
Once upon a time

{Girl} Hifuela mijo tell me what happened next

The next day I was walking to the marketplace
I passed by the cathedral so I stopped to pray
I imagined this journey without my friend
And just like an angel she appeared again
...

How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, you
You're the only one who really knew me all

How can you just walk away from me?
When all I can do is watch you leave
Girl we shared the laughter and the pain
We even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me all

Take a look at me now
There is just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just a memory of your face
Take a look at me now
There is just an empty space

Take a little time to express myself

And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because

South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava

Let's flip the track, bring the old school back

And wave them from here to there

Baby I'm falling
Falling for you
And I just can't help myself
Baby I'm falling

Thirty days since our first kiss
Sit alone reminisce
What you said last night just took me by surprise
How you said you're not gonna cry no more
You're waiting to exhale
Having feelings that you're falling
Woman I've already fell

Repeat 1

Contemplating what to do
Falling faster over you
But my heart and pride are out there on the line

Oh yeah, coming right back at cha,
with a different type of swing
You know, you better ask somebody
Baby, this is for you, and you, and definitely you

I'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back
I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sitting on my lap
Slamming the ivories until I sees
a female worth my while
I'm scoping it, checking a smile
And I know that I can get it
and I'll hit it if she's with it
I get the 5 to the 6-7 digits
call her up on my cellular
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skizins
So if a girlie is lonesome
I think that she knows where to go when she wants some
'cause Monty ain't here for nothing but I gotta let all

The one to rescue you and take you by the hand
Oh, I wanna be your superlover man

You never knew that goodbye could hurt so much
Till the morning he told you he was going away
He lied to you, mistreated you, he even raised his hand to you
You weathered the storm, but ended up in the rain

It's driving you crazy, you're wondering maybe
Think it's something you did wrong
You carried his baby, but now, now, now, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

Oh, hey, yeah

Another Friday night
Another honey sitting in my ride
Another lyrical flava from your 6'8" neighbor
Make ya wave your hands from side to side

In '95 we did it
But this year I bring a new twist
They say I'm here to announce this song called the bounce
So everybody bounce to this

(So right) It's so right (So nice)
Tell you I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)
It's so right (So right)
And so nice (So nice)
I tell you I'll make you wanna bounce to this

Montell started bouncin' on ghetto neighborhood blocks
You see I'm vocally silent and that keeps my wallet so fat
I have to stuff my socks
My 'hood keeps getting bigger 'cause phat def jams I bring
And now the world is bouncin' while I do my thing

I've been to parties across the USA
I've been to other countries
And I've made those people say
Bartender, ooh my cup is runnin' low
So pass the Alize and let the music play
And act like you know

It's so right (So right)
It's so right (So nice)
And I'll make you wanna bounce to this

You are all I want girl, she's a chicken
We might be together, but love is missing
Girl I want you, so what can we do, oh

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

But I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

Lipstick, hair weaves, and toe nails
A hotel lobby full of females
And though I can't give you all the details
I still remember
Some particular shorty on a certain night
She was specifically standing over to my right
She's GHETTOFABULOUS, and I'm sure
If I tried to take her home with me she'd say

She won't have sex if you don't wait (Oh, no)

Definition of beauty is you
Yeah, it's you

Beauty to my eyes, heaven to my soul
Darling, don't you know you're irresistible?
Honey, realize, it's you I want to hold
Darling, don't you know you're irresistible?

Baby, you don't know what you do to me
Your naked silhouette built like a symphony
Your body, my God must have hand designed
I figured that your figure could be a friend of mine
Irresistible

Beauty to my eyes, heaven to my soul
Darling, don't you know you're irresistible?
Honey, realize, it's you I want to hold
Darling, don't you know you're irresistible?

On a scale from one to ten, you're a 69
Caramel complexion, chocolate so divine

Where are you sleeping, baby

When are you leaving, I gotta know?
Not talking dirty, baby
But it's 1 30 AM
And neither one of us needs to be alone

Know what I'm saying? Yo, check this out

I got a new lady in my life and it hurts so much to say goodbye
Every time I'm on the road, in my hotel room alone
I stare at your picture, I miss you, I wanna come home

I miss you so, counting the tears on my pillow
Nobody knows quite like I know how I'm missing you
And when those teardrops fall like rain, I don't wanna feel like this again
You hear what I'm saying? Sydney, I'm missing you

Da-da's home, I'm gonna sweep you off your feet
Hold you in my arms and sing you to sleep

Two lonely hearts in search of love meet finally face to face
The happiness and joy I'd lost, I found in your embrace
A taste of heaven is in your kiss, I lie you down and then
I memorize what I'm feeling now, don't want this night to end

It was the longest night of my life
We made love until the morning light
It was the longest night of my life
Why did we ever have to say goodnight
I never wanna say goodnight

Yeah, I wish this night could go on forever
And if I can do anything to make that happen
I promise you, I'll do it

He don't deserve a woman like you, woman you are

You never knew that goodbye could hurt so much
Till the morning he told you he was going away
He lied to you, mistreated you, he even raised his hand to you
You weathered the storm, but ended up in the rain

It's driving you crazy, you're wondering maybe
Think it's something you did wrong
You carried his baby, but now, now, now, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

You were so strong
The sun's gonna shine again, it won't be long

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life

Oh, hey, yeah

Another Friday night
Another honey sitting in my ride
Another lyrical flava from your 6'8" neighbor
Make ya wave your hands from side to side

In '95 we did it
But this year I bring a new twist
They say I'm here to announce this song called the bounce
So everybody bounce to this

(So right) It's so right (So nice)
Tell you I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)
It's so right (So right)
And so nice (So nice)
I tell you I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)

Montell started bouncin' on ghetto neighborhood blocks
You see I'm vocally silent and that keeps my wallet so fat
I have to stuff my socks
My 'hood keeps getting bigger 'cause phat def jams I bring
And now the world is bouncin' while I do my thing

I've been to parties across the USA
I've been to other countries
And I've made those people say
Bartender, ooh my cup is runnin' low
So pass the Alize and let the music play
And act like you know

It's so right (So right)
It's so right (So nice)
And I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)
It's alright (So right)

call her up on my cellular
And all the shit that I'll say to her

The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

You know why I came to see you
You don’t take my calls
And you won’t return my pages

Should I just pull out?

You scratch my back
But it's not a fight

We finished arguing much earlier tonight

Uncle Montelly, yo may you please read us a story please?
Nah, I don’t feel much like telling a story today kid
Please, read us a story, I said, no kid
Please, read us a story, okay, here we go

Now listen to the words that I say
'Cause this type of song will take you back in the day
It all started back in Cali-from-I-A
Where the khakis hang low and gang bangers don’t play

Put on my drawers
Walked down the hall
Kissed my Apollonian poster on the wall
My first day of high school on my way

You need to eat your breakfast
Mom, I am late
Funky fresh, stepped into the school
And that’s when I saw her standing with this dude
Young, tender, sweet Denise

To take her on a date you need a $1000 at least
Plus, she’s used to dating dope dealers
Cats with felonies who tote heaters
You won't believe what’s in the 2nd verse
You better buckle up, it's 'bout to get worse

Can’t believe that that’s Denise
The one from high school with the dope body
But now she is out there going for broke
And all her dreams went up in smoke

I'm comin' home
I said I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
I said I'm comin' home
I just can't wait to get back home

I'm comin' home
(Back to L.A.)
I said I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
(Ba-back to L.A.)
I said I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
(Back to L.A.)
I said I'm comin' home
(Ba-back to L.A.)

Damn, it's good to be back home
In city streets where I used to roam
The neighborhood has changed
But somethin' always stays the same
Liquor stores on every other block
I see my homies so I make a stop
And though I'm tempted
I won't fall back in the game

My next stop is filled with love
Because it's moms and pops I'm thinkin' of
As I get closer, I smell the Bar-B-Q
And as I step into the yard
My grandma shouts "I praise the Lord"
And so do the honeys, uh
This'll be so cool
To be back home

Now Monty is my name, and you know I gets to it
Because I'm kinda fluid, so the Simmons to the Stewart
Now Stewart got the cash, I went and got equipment
I made some funky shit that you niggas can't get wit
"Now Monty, why'd you do it? You're an R and B singer"
For real, stop, a real style is what I had to bring-uh
I'm not a gang banger and I don't buck buck
If niggas get to shootin', I'm the nigga that duck
I don't smoke indo, that's all because
I'm more than happy wit my contact buzz

(Intro)
You don't know how to treat a man
That's what it comes down to
All your girlfriends know
But check it out
All the good things we've been through
(it's all because of you)

It's over (do do do)
I think you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over (la no no no)
I think you should know
You need to pack your things and go

That ain't love, that ain't love, girl
And all your girlfriends know
They tell me they've told you so
That I'm not the one to play
And all my boys are tellin' me
That I'm too good to you
And I don't wanna be your fool
So I'll send you on your way

It's over
Oh, it's over
Baby you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over
Said it's over, said it's over
I think you should know

Looks like it's gonna rain
So we can lay back
Watch some Jerry Springer on TV
Yo, watch this

We can leave the TV on
We'll use it for it's light
Let the CD's play
It'll get us through the night
Now dinner was delicious, don't mean to stare but

Feat. Da Gents

Lady...

(Montell) (Da Gents)
You don't understand the physical attraction
Between a (woman and a man)
A woman and a man
See, you don't need to man to be
(Calling you) calling you
(Spoiling you) spoiling you
You wanna have a good time
And tonight it's all about you

1 - (Da Gents)
We don't have to be lovers
We don't have to be friends
All I wanna do baby, is hit the skins

(Montell)
Cuz I, I, I, I...

Say you like it, I wanna hear you
Baby, baby, baby, louder
Say you like it, tell me how you like it
Say you like it 'cause tonight you're getting it all, baby

Tell me you like it
Oh girl, you want it, lady
Do you want it? Then let me up on it
Do you like it? Is it good to you?
Oh, oh, no, no

You say you've got a man but he ain't home
It's getting late in the evening and he leaves you all alone
I can see that you're tempted, oh girl, to do somethin' wrong
And when my song played on the radio, now you wanna get it on

Girl, let me take off your stockings
I'll pull 'em down, pull 'em down real slow
Your body needs my attention
From your head to your baby toes

I know you're scared, I see you shaking
Your thighs are just aching for a good tongue spanking
A towel you need to get
'Cause it's all slippery when it's wet

'Cause I'm going down
(I'll go down on my knees)
Oh, I'm going down and do the things that you want me to
All the things that your man won't do, I'll do 'em
(I'll go down on my knees)

Said, I'm going down, going down, down
You know that I will do anything for you

So many ways we can do it
On your knees, on the floor, in the shower

(Intro-lude)
Can you ball Montell?
You got game?
(Yeah, I got game!)
Okay buddy
(Okay)
I know he ain't got no game

(Intro)
From the westside to the eastside
From the northside to the southside
I got good dues if you like the rules
I said I got good dues
Oh oh ohh, oh yeah
Oh yeah

The sun comes up in my neighborhood
I scratch my nuts, and man it sure feels good
I'm leanin' in the corner like I'm barely alive
'Cause I remember a time when I didn't have a ride
Always in the passenger seat
And always next to last when the honeys, we would meet
But now that things have changed, slightly re-arranged
I must admit, it's kinda strange
To be walkin' down the 'Shaw with my big black boots
And my happy Nappy wear, and my Karl Kani suits
I got a big truck, it's parked up the block, and
I see ya ladies jockin', yeah, you're takin' stock
Now that I have your attention, did I mention
I got back in LA, uh, it's in my CD player
The days of ol' when I used to get my stroll on
Are now long gone, 'cause...

1 - I gotta get my roll on
I've got to get mine
Don't you know it's time
I gotta get my roll on

Close the door
Let me give you what you've been waiting for
Baby, I got so much love to give
And I wanna give it all to you

Close the door
No need to worry no more
Let's bring this day to a pleasant end
Girl, it's me and you now

I've waited all day long
Just to hold you in my arms
And it's exactly like I thought it would be
Me loving you and you loving me

Close the door
Let me rub your back where you say it's sore

Do da da da
La da la

(Montell)
I know, I'm not the man you thought I'd be
We started out so young
Your mother, and me
I know that I hurt you
I was a child trying to be a man
I walked out on my only son
I left you in your mother's hands
And now I'm standing right here
With tears, with tears streaming from my eyes
See your mother raised a fine young man
And I know I missed so much of your life

Look at me
Take a real good look at me
Don't turn away
Don't you turn away like I did my son
...

Hey baby, I like it when you're next to me
With that body horizontally
Your pretty legs comfortable in my bed
In your lingerie with my pillow under your head

And honey I like you 'cuz you trust in me
Just so glad to have you on my team
So I'll keep it real with you
Girl, I'm feelin' you, layin' here

Layin' next to you at night
Kissin' and holdin' you tight
All of these things I like
Girl you are mine, mine, mine

You got a lot of sex appeal
I love the way you make me feel
And what I feel is real
Girl, you're one of a kind

You're the right one
Right one i let get away
Ooh girl, now what can i say?
To get back into your happy days
You're the right one
Right one, what was wrong with me?
Missin' all that taddy
Promise me you'll save me some
Cuz baby
I haven't seen you in a while
By the looks of your profile
Say it's been a year or more

Oh yeah, yeah
Mmm
Mmm, mm-hmm
Oh, oh
Damn

Must've been C-R-A-Z-Y
We got all out of sync and went bye bye bye
Not too long ago, you was mine mine mine
Seems like yesterday (yesterday)
Ninety on the freeway, pushin' my ride
Heard you got engaged and I'm losin' my mind
Ask myself the question, why why why
Why'd I let you get away from me?

Well you must've been, thinkin' I'm a jerk
Cryin' out to God, tryin' to make this work
Girl you must've been, stayin' with a fool
Loving somebody that could be so cruel
Well you must've been, packin' your bags
Silly of me, I couldn't see the red flag
Girl I'm sure that (sure that) you must have been
Sick and tired of me

(Intro)
See
Niggas think this love stuff is easy
Heh, it's not the case

Fallin' in love is so easy
But stayin' that way is so hard
All she wanted was security
A man with a job and a car, baby
You'd think I oughtta be happy
On a hill with a view of the stars
But as soon as I had to go out of town for a week
I went to the next woman's arms

1 - If I coulda seen it, inside her
Woulda seen her broken heart
I woulda held on, tighter
Then we wouldn't be falling apart
I shoulda said I love her
A thousand times a day

Girl I've got a question, here it is
How much longer 'til you let me taste your lips?
You can make a nigga wait if that's your thing
But anticipation drivin' me insane

I'm losing my composure
Tryin' to keep my cool
You start me, then you stop me
So what am I supposed to do?
Sometimes you be actin' so scared
When you know in my heart that I care

1 - Why can't we, just get past the smalltalk and formalities?
Wanna tell you that I want you, but it seems so hard
To let down my guard, and reveal my cards
Your body's convincin' me, so why can't we?
Get right to the foreplay, and right now we'll be
Got me dippin' in your ocean, did I go to deep?
I'm just tryin' to see, baby why can't we?

Listen
Shh.
You hear that?
Can you hear that?
Listen

Ohh, ohh, ohh

Lying in my bedroom next to me
Nervous like a child playing hide and seek
I never knew how fast that your heart could beat
It's like it's your first time

But now that your intentions have been revealed
You wanna feel what lovers feel
There's no need to pretend if you don't know how
I'm gonna show you now

1 - Just say what you're feeling
Your secret is safe with me

VERSE 1
I know I've spent my whole life running from you
Even though there's been some things you needed me to do
I did it my way and hurt you over and over again
But you were preparing me
To carry out your plan
Though you said that you'd walk with me, some won't believe
Cause the messenger you chose sings R&B
So the man that you rescued me from is the man that they still
And I don't know what to say
I need you to speak for me

CHORUS
So Lord, this is my prayer
Your “work in progress” humbly asks of thee
Once your promise is fulfilled, the world will be watching anxiously
Lord help someone to see, the YOU in ME
Lord help just one to see, the YOU in ME

VERSE 2
Someone listening right now needs to hear this tonight
Cause you're lonely and there's an emptiness you're trying to fill in your life

La la la la la la la
La la lo lo lo lo oh
[This is how we do it]
La la la la oh

This is how we do it, it's Friday night
And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because 
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava 
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
