Yo, what's up everybody

Wait a minute, I see my man over there Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dame Dash let me here that little tape of yours
And it's phat
Why don't you come up here and kick a little freestyle?
Put that champagne down
And kick a little freestyle for me tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I kick it?

Too much west coast dick lickin'
And too many niggas on a mission
Doin ya best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough muthafuckas
I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies
So if you a hoe, I'ma call you a hoe
Too many bitches is shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances

I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

Who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce
Stack cheddars forever
Live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us: me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill 3 quarts of my blood into the street
Let alone the heat
Fuck em, they hate a nigga loving this life
In all possible ways, just know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital dazed, reflecting when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said "pray for me"
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothing but time

Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related
Most hate it.

While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him
What's ya name?

. Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Tryin to push 700's, they ain't made them yet
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too

What? Jay-Z, what

I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me

You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me, they connivin' shit

The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent francs
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly, no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)

Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroudin' your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan

You know these ho's be makin' me weak

For real, with no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella click nigga

Aiyyo we pattin' down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gaspin' for air in Aspen
Searchin' for aspirin when I ask then, we swing

You cling we do our thing and bring
Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast hostess hostile colossal, money flarin'
Like nostrils for drug dealin' apostles, huh

Al Pacino down to Nino Brown, Me Jay and Primo
Got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull

Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin' to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars

Star studded bitches with crystals, get fucked with pistols
Just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thang

Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone

Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
when I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
and kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

(Beanie Sigel)
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct

Peep the scripts gold honey from the whips
Jumped out like yo who the fuck you with
Flash the juice 'cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
Face natural can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I didn't know how many niggas was humping hon

I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different let you push the 6
And give you a different life and
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning
And ride it till the night
Want to buy you real jury when it hits the light
Bitches are momentarily lose they sight

She said
"I know what boys like, I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like, I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me"

So want a cute with a booty like ow
Deeper than the mow airy shine like tadow
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens, get it?

Bubble hard in the double R, flashin' the rings

And to Hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang

'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up

Tryin' to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it

See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up

Multi 'til I close up, it's all basic

Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas

I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

Who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce
Stack cheddars forever
Live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us: me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill 3 quarts of my blood into the street
Let alone the heat
Fuck em, they hate a nigga loving this life
In all possible ways, just know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital dazed, reflecting when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said "pray for me"
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothing but time

Sunshine Geyeah

I sold it all from crack to opium in third person
I don't wanna see 'em so I'm rehearsin'
With my peoples high to GM from a remote location
In the BM scopin' the whole situation like "Dayamm!"

Metamorphic as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em the windows to his soul
Are half closed I put the key in

Pulled off slow hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib at a sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner

Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time, stress, givin' this shit up fuck

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather

"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said

Got the whole industry mad at me I said

Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

You can't roll a blunt to this one
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one. (inhales)
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL. Woo!
Buy some red wine, a little Gocha 9-7
This is for the grown and sexy
Uhh!

You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Ex-cuse me; what's your name?

Only thing missin is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid. All I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, All trust!
Who else you gon' run with, the truth is us
Only dudes movin units - em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maebach outside got rocks n air
PJ's on the runway, Young got air

Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

Swear to God I just touched down:
All around the world (same song)
Killa Cali nigga (same song)
A-T-L (same song)
Real adelphia... dude it's all around the world:
London, England, south of France
And all points between they know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan
I'm a Tokyo giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap' or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like weed
Your man'll stand Manta Ray, handlin' a steak
And handlin' the modern stand about five eight
Five nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the Four Seasons, off the heezy
When it's back home nigga back to the zone
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me:
All around the world (same song)
Brooklyn bombers (same song)

Yeah it's magic
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D Production you bastards
Come on
Ha hey yo stop playin' man
This is real serious
Ha it's the rock yeah yo

Post postatono, Hov' hangin' with Bono
You too can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you too can cool out poolside after Delano
If you too flow like you was out of your mind yo
And who knew dude who loved apple pies from McDonalds
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude would play ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who know it stayed still in the way

Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cool that way
But even a broken clock is right atleast two times a day
You could have turned guns into roses like two times today
Now there's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
Its safe when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go

C'mon it's the rock
C'mon it's the rock
C'mon it's the rock

Let's go get 'em just

Time to duck, fire
Duck, fire, duck, fire
Duck, fire, duck, fire
It's the M.O.P. and the dip code is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3

And motherfucker we comin, 100 miles and gunnin
I'm still runnin' with cash that's robbed
From the era of exhale 80's and hats back stomp
Same game, operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go blockow
Run up if you wanna, believe me dog
These hammers with they owners, fuck ya G up
Have ya with blue 'jamas in a coma, and

Ya family now moan, look, 70 pounds gone
A little fuck, scribbled up with a hospital down on
We holdin' it down homes keep pushin' weak frail bastards
To get over, we prowl with slimmer re-shelled tactics
Jiminy frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
No limit, what the fuck, recordin' for nig' junior

Whoo Uh Uh
The gift and the curse
Uh Uh yeah
First they love me then they hate me
Then they love me again
Love me again
Lets take a trip down

Lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live
It's this line damn him already
Such a goodkid got us poring Hen(nessy) already
Liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
When it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name? shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him could save him
He put his faith in the 38 in his waist
But when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate

Just point out the bounce, jeah Timbo the King, yeah
Young Hov' the King, yeah just point out the bounce
Yes, just point out the bounce nigga ya, listen

Rumor has it 'The Blueprint Classic'
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevero

Now it's a whole museum of Hov' Mcers
Everybody dupin' the flow you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like you tryin' to make 'The Blueprint 2 before Hov'

Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kan-Yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin', glancin' every chance they get
Like oh shit, he's so handsome

Still in demand in the longest run standin'
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin' to Canton, I'm now eligible

Point out the bounce
And show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts till it's hard to count

Point out the bounce
I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C

Point out the bounce

Uhh, yeah, uhh

Point out the bounce

Ladies, if you with me grind to the base line

And make her show out her wild side, sneak out the back side

What they gone do with me
Got money got broads got a crew with me
Willis bananas clips, I got a slew with me
Get down and lay down and get a shoe with me

Now how the fuck they gone deal with me
I ain't goin' nowhere they got to deal with me
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
You scared muthafucker, keep it real with me
Keep it real with me

Now what the fuck they gone say to me
Got the clap, ya mean, all day with me
Cut, ya mean, don't play with me
Cut, ya mean, stay with me

Don't lose me, y'all
Please don't confuse me with Dog, I'm different
I brought it back for a livin'
33's O's was on the bitch, back like pippen

Before Mitchell and Ness did it

Lay back in that Maebach roll the best grass

Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?"

Put the gun to the back and hop on some ass

Put the ewings on the truck 'for I drop the rag
Bitches want to bring up the topic of my past

Fellow Americans, It is with the upmost pride and sincerity that i present this recording as a militestament and recollection of history in the making during our generation.

Allow me to re-introduce myself, My name is HOV
H to the O-V, I used to move snowflakes by the O.Z.
I guess even back then you can call me
C.E.O of the R.O.C HOV
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number 1 supplier
Flier than a piece or paper bearing my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, thats right HOV
Not D.O.C, similar to the letters no one can do it better
I check cheddar like a food inspector

Feel it comin' in the air

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (everybody bounce, come on)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town

We are
Yeah I said it
We are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on
All black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds
Ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is La Familia
I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma six zeros dot zero
Here Doug
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas
Now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight

But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me

Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier

'Cuz Mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
with no pen just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him

In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law

But I don't fuckin feed em
First time they fuss I'm breezin
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe em
In the cut where I keep em
til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
so you can be livin it up? Shit I.
parts with nothin, y'all be frontin
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin, never happen
I'll be forever mackin
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin.
Hoe get yo' ass in
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE. check em out now

Yea standin' knock right here
You fuck around not have the right speakers in your system
Your shit be soundin' like this

Big things, thick chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four dot six range
Shit mayn, switch slanes every town I hit you
Switch slames bitch flip big caine

I givin' 'em whiplash when I'm whippin' the whip fast
Which one pick one nigga I gotta six stashed
Continental T's no tense like I got a thick stab
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it is so funny

Six-four switches, slam doors on sixes
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill

Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'm a pull out the yard
They know I come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin' to pull menage

Just Mac is God the sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
'Cause I push Black Porsches, Benzes and Jaguarses

When the rag's off it gat on my lap I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sittin' on twenties they get nauseous
Standin' in the azure with white air forces

You can catch me in the parkin' lot
Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin'

Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year
You can stay the night
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice tai chi
That still can by weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

Jay-Z (Amil)-
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough

Promise we'll grow, they going

Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough

Duckin' the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was

I was prickin' my finger 'fore you knew what the Fam was

Ya'll ain't see us comin' through Vegas

Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend

Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

And handlin the modern stand about five-eight
Five-nine fine wine fine dine either that

Would make a mistake on the who know it stayed still in the way
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now there's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action

Turn my music high, high, high, high-er

I'm from the streets where the
Hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow a man
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities crash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street homes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip you are now gone
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return 'em
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hopping out the back of van
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it
Was clapping them flamers before I became famous
For playing me y'all shall forever remain nameless

Rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live
It's this line damn him already
Such a goodkid got us poring Hen(nessy) already
Liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
When it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name? shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him could save him
He put his faith in the 38 in his waist
But when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate

And too many niggas on a mission
Doin ya best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough muthafuckas
I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies
So if you a hoe, I'ma call you a hoe
Too many bitches is shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances

Yeah, (hah, yeah) Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to, somethin epic y'all know?(something, something)
Well we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation(live nigga)
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to servin
But we feel we have nothin to lose(everything to gain)
so we offer you, well, we offer our lives, (right)
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watchin every nigga watchin me closely
my shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
a brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from sellin 'caine
til brains was fried to a fricaisse, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
gettin my thug on properly, my squad and me
lack of respect for authority, laughin hard
Happy to be escapin poverty, however brief

Foxy Brown
What? Jay-Z, what

I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me

You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me, they connivin' shit

The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent francs
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly, no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)

Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroudin' your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan

I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B and so I creep

Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gaspin' for air in Aspen

Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast hostess hostile colossal, money flarin'
Like nostrils for drug dealin' apostles, huh

Al Pacino down to Nino Brown, Me Jay and Primo
Got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull

Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin' to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars

Star studded bitches with crystals, get fucked with pistols
Just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thang
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang

Stress
Sunshine Geyeah

I sold it all from crack to opium in third person
I don't wanna see 'em so I'm rehearsin'
With my peoples high to GM from a remote location
In the BM scopin' the whole situation like "Dayamm!"

Metamorphic as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em the windows to his soul
Are half closed I put the key in

Pulled off slow hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib at a sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner

Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time, stress, givin' this shit up fuck

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget

Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow

Don't worry about Brooklyn I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough, let me take those reins
And just like your spirit the commission remains

Niggaz can cross the T's and, dots the I's
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm takin this rap shit serious, to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise

Basics in the basement, waste it
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit

Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do?
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all n*ggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas
tryin to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
or taking pictures with some b*tches, in front of the drop
The streets is watching

Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake

I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more

How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?
How can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga
he never even met that he dont even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

Y'all dont even know every day I'm livin with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?
I'try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time dont let Ms. Carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
and I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars... Lucky Me

Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
'Cuz who's gettin' played is not me
"Surely you jest," she said, "If you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"

I said maturely, "You right, but better safe than sorry
But for the lovebirds can move to the suburbs

To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my sunshine"

I'm from where the hammer's rung, news cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run

Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt there more something and you nothing check

I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up the town and then sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us

I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it

I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best Mc's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars

Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy Son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)

I am eternally grateful.

[Verse 1]
Since my date of birth
bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games
stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench
'til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me
don't let 'em hold you back
What I do I turned around
and I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that
still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now
you're not to blame
You was newly seperated
tryin' to escape ya world
and through my thirst
I didn't help you
I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody
that created crack
Had me thinkin'
the newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized
so please play this back
while I try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about
how the funds once came
then I ran across this memory
and it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
That's a savage you're the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why I rhyme above average and
I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be

Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels, dropped school
Still didn't fail, rhymes still written well
Hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters
Fuck sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me

Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone

Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi-geyeah, bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me, get it

Can I hit in the mornin'
Without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things

Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't drivin'?

If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya

See yourself with a nigga workin' harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla?
So you can shop and tear the mall up?

Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself
With a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?

Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch
Gotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here
for all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya
If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (That's right!)

Cause I'm Like That yo! Cause I'm like that yo!

As a young and dumb man, gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with baste
Couldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
I needed something to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin nothin to waste
Life is like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place
Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past
> I vowed to never stop winnin, 'til the earth stop spinnin
Rock hot lenin, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not remembering,
My motto is simply I will not lose, abide by the block rules,
I buy my glock used, wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood,
If you ain't live like I live then run with the hood
I done what i could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature, if hell awaits ya?
Nigga I'm coming with the razors, still flashin ya shit

Nah, not in your life ain't nobody copin' like Mr. Jay-Z, shit you're crazy
I'm hot like the six maybe, deep dish with the great seats
I flow greater than your navigator, I drop in your town, block your data
Pimps all comin' through with a hot pair gators
And a crew with rocks the size of craters
Can't touch like hot potatoes, ya heard?

With the top down screamin' out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R, flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to Hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit' us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside

Tryin' to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it

Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up

Multi 'til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy, where you at haters?

Yeah, I'm up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot: 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but B.K. is from Texas
Now I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

I made you hot nigga
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though

Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason

But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

This is anti-AutoTune, death of the ringtone
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song

Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies

Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression

Ah, or your lack of aggression
Pull your skirt back down, grow a set men
Ah, ah... nigga this shit violent
This is death of AutoTune, ah moment of silence

If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son

Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed

I'm from the hood, stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like "Fuck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Year's '94 and my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or, hmm,
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I could fight the case

From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

Thanks for comin out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that. uuunnnh.

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in

Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin...
Begin... begin

This is anti-AutoTune, death of the ringtone
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song

Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies

Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression

Ah, or your lack of aggression
Pull your skirt back down, grow a set men
Ah, ah... nigga this shit violent
This is death of AutoTune, ah moment of silence

La da da da... hey hey hey goodbye

If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
I'm from the hood, stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like "Fuck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Year's '94 and my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or, hmm,
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I could fight the case

Yeah
Yeah I'm out that Brooklyn.
Now I'm down in Tribeca.
Right next to De Niro
But I'll be hood forever
I'm the new sinatra
And since i made it here
I can make it anywhere
(yeah they love me everywhere)
I used to cop in Harlem
Hola my dominicanos (hey yo)
Right there up on Broadway
Brought me back to that McDonalds
Took it to my stash spot
560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen
Like Simmons whipping Pastry
Cruising down 8th Street
Off-white Lexus
Driving so slow
(but bk, it's from Texas!!)
Me I'm out that Bedstuy
Home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard
And I brought my boys with me
Say what up to ta-ta
Still sipping mai tais
Sitting courtside
Knicks and Nets give me high-5
Nga, I be spiked out
I could trip a referee
...tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from...
New York!!!!

There's nothing you can't do,

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter

Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Okay, Show me what you got baby

Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery
Thanks to the pastor rapping at your eulogy

Who carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers

Big homie from the back block
When you first learn how to slap box
Then you even learn how to chill with the pill
Or handle the pot bring it back rock
Number one rule if you *** get popped
Don't cheddar box to the matlocks
Death before dishonor I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 ruined it and it might sound rude but yep **** you paid me
I drown my pain in porsches
I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest
Or I could just call this a night
on dark nights its like I see better
on Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs
Motherfuckers can't kill my buzz

Halfway out of my mind music on 9, blasting Donny Hathaway
Me and my niggas spending half the day
Plotting, how we gon get this math with out getting balst away
I wake up to the same problems after today
Life is harsh, niggas gotta?
Right from the start they place me in the ghetto tender age of nine
I tend to mine and to surrender to crime
Wouldnt wish this on nobody like the end of like mine
Ever since i was quite young a nigga been in divine
Had to scratch for every plaque, rap aint even all it's cracked up to be
Niggas don't stack up to me
Had to hustle in a world of trouble
Trapped in, clostrophobic the only way out was rapping
America don't understand it, the demographics i tapped in
I'm the truest nigga to do this nigga and anything else is foolish
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies

In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down

Defend me from all that rise up against me
Deliver me from the work of iniquity
And save me from the Bloody Men

Look. mind state of a gangster from the 40's
Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America, meet the gangster Shawn Corey
Hey young world, wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedies
Frank Sinatra, having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn and the turntables turn
And that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store
We can never be sure, so all we can do is... pray

Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee

Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all baby
Oh no oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
But there's always
That's all, that's all

This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Beemers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving

Burnt it all this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back not having much, not having that
Had to get some hollerest you can holla back at
Holla that my jewish lawyer do enjoy the fruit of within my cash stack
Just in case a nigga got to use his rat-ta-ta-ta-tat
Own boss own yawt, masters, slave

Sweet and still there's pain
If I would have grew up to be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed
And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the hall of mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearin the coast up
Tight coupes like I'm wearin the roadster
For in the coup, bearhuggin the holster

And that may not be what you call perfect but
But it's my life

Constant in the drop, all flames

Swayed in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same
Except I'm no lame and you gonna know my name
Before I go to work and feel my pain
Saying, I'm a bad guy, why's that?
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga, I react
Secretly though, I know you admire that
You wish you had the balls to fire back-
Say hello, uh, uh, hello, uh. uh

I know its gon' destroy everything i made
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
Its inevitable that i'm-

Said where i would stop before i even started
When i get to one brick, then The Game i will depart with
Got to one brick then i looked to the sky, said
Sorry God, i lied, but give me one more try
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn til' they end up in the newsclip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like i'm using it
Guess its two sides to what 'substance abuse' is
Can't stop, won't stop, nigga since new shit
Brand new convertibles, i'm so ruthless
Front row, fight night-see how big my tube is?
Fuck HD, nigga see how clear my view is?

But when shit goes down you know who's doin' the poppin'
And if you don't know guess who's doin' the droppin'

S dot again y'all got him in a bad mood
Bad move that's bad news
How many times have I got to prove?
How many loved ones have you got to lose?

Sup ma? You want to roll with us, y'knowhatI'msayin'?
It's good, it's love, it's all love
Got cases of Belvedere, we gon' play truth or dare
We gon' really get to know one another
All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right
You know what I mean? I'm here for you, yo

Relax yourself, let your conscience be free
You now rollin' with them thugs from the ROC
Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
But in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game

Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot
The topic of discussion in every nail shop
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
And within a week, watch your arm freeze up

Brassiere get right, A to a D cup
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
Ears get iced, gear get spiced
From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life

Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your Hell
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta play your part when you're rollin' with the ROC
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family

Money over bitches nigga stick to the script, DJ Clue

Yo, they call me William H., H, the all-time great, great
I fuck the most hoes out of New York State, state
I rock my jewels, jewels I'm not a fool, fool
In the small of my back I got this big-ass tool

When I'm skatin' through the city and I stop and kick it
Be the most asked question, how I got them digits?
I say I stay on my grind, never stop for bitches
Never talk like a mom, I gotta watch you snitches

And I stick to the script, that's my advice so life
Eat nigga, let it stick to your ribs
I seen niggaz go from handlin' birds to ramblin' words
To the man, seen a Sammy the Bull emerge on the stand

And it was all good just a week ago
We lost Todd E., but we still eatin' though
For like a hundred weeks nigga, we gon' run the streets
'Til we reach Malik or the date of E's release

That's how we workin' huh? Okay
Before me there was many, after me there will be none

Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin'

Yeah, I get it down, anxiously the public can't wait
Niggaz had to have it way before its release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight

Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take

I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggaz up settin' my Mama
Arrested, put in the line-up, tryin' to put dents in my armor

But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty though, still ridin' with toast
I ain't tryin' to collide with folk, but I don't want folk takin' Jigga for joke
I guess you niggaz just woke, good morning!

You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
(Jigga, Kelly, not guilty)
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
(I got, all, my mamis)
I've got all of my mamis
(Tell me, what you, want from me)
Tell me, what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

I see how you comin' at me now, I'm cool
I'm not the snitch, I don't go to the cops to get rich
I go to the block and pitch
I go with the glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick

Switch slames bitch flip big caine

I givin' 'em whiplash when I'm whippin' the whip fast
Which one pick one nigga I gotta six stashed
Continental T's no tense like I got a thick stab
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it is so funny

Six-four switches, slam doors on sixes
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill

Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'm a pull out the yard
They know I come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin' to pull menage

Just Mac is God the sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
'Cause I push Black Porsches, Benzes and Jaguarses

When the rag's off it gat on my lap I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sittin' on twenties they get nauseous
Standin' in the azure with white air forces

You can catch me in the parkin' lot

What's the problem shorty?
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
but I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla
1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy

You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small
Shit I watched you mature - nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin a guy
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me

Damn how am I gonna say this shit, hey

'Cause all they said was little whitey look, I'm just like you

But dog I can't see it at all, shit, we never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit, how to fight, ride a bike, fix the flat
None of that sorts of shit, nigga you was an abusive pops
Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach news to box, gotta teach news to block

And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach news to block
It's about time we have a father to son nigga sit down
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters, nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
Never follow your orders

Nigga you make me sick, pussy you could, ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin' my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out

Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hittin' shots

So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name? shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men

But shake a nigga hand, but shit God damn
All that
("Do you remember me dawg?")
Nah I'm drawin' a blank
You got me feelin' like a fish, in a fish tank
Just think, if you came to a club
Tryin' to find a little hon for some one-night love
'Stead you got another nigga all up in your mug
You make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way

And kill the ice grill homes
'Coz I keep enough heat to melt that away
I came in some sweats, I came to get met
Tryin' to find a chick that make it hard for me to "Next!"
We exit stage left, hope in the Lexus
Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es
May I suggest that it's
A lot of long-legged chicks in short-ass dresses

Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do?
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all n*ggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas
tryin to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
or taking pictures with some b*tches, in front of the drop
The streets is watching

*chorus*
When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

Man, it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
the streets is watching you, when you froze your arms

Bein that, I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I came and did
since ninety-six, every year
Somethin must be seriously wrong with the world

And fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters

How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she?
And you wiped her, shit I put that rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear that at Earl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch

Oh is that your bitch
Why she all in his six?

With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me

You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me, they connivin' shit

The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent francs
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly, no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)

Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroudin' your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan

I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B and so I creep

Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Movin a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggaz to see
Time to start the arisin now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

It seems, I'm like Keenan, pickin up on the vibe
that he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividin the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matchin the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggaz think I fell out the loop
cause the last time they seen me hoppin, out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

Look at this nigga Jay frontin tryin to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce, more than I used to puff
Takin advice from these niggaz but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinkin, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
while he drive around town in brand new Coupe's and stufF"
Swear to God, they had me practically hatin his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga whattup?"

I done came up (uhh) put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?) no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing

Got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull

Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin' to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars

Star studded bitches with crystals, get fucked with pistols
Just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella

Stress
Sunshine Geyeah

I sold it all from crack to opium in third person
I don't wanna see 'em so I'm rehearsin'
With my peoples high to GM from a remote location
In the BM scopin' the whole situation like "Dayamm!"

Metamorphic as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em the windows to his soul
Are half closed I put the key in

Pulled off slow hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib at a sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner

Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time, stress, givin' this shit up fuck

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

If through our travels we get separated, never forget

Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do?
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all n*ggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas
tryin to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
or taking pictures with some b*tches, in front of the drop
The streets is watching

Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit

I told you don't ever ever come around here no more

How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?
How can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga
he never even met that he dont even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

Y'all dont even know every day I'm livin with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?
I'try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time dont let Ms. Carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
and I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars... Lucky Me

'Cuz who's gettin' played is not me

Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"

I said maturely, "You right, but better safe than sorry
But for the lovebirds can move to the suburbs

And you deserve to be my sunshine"

You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run

Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt there more something and you nothing check

I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up the town and then sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us

I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it

I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best Mc's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars

Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy Son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

bought you nothing but hurt

Sat on the cold court bench
'til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me
don't let 'em hold you back
What I do I turned around
and I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that
still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now
you're not to blame
You was newly seperated
tryin' to escape ya world
and through my thirst
I didn't help you
I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody
that created crack
Had me thinkin'
the newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized
so please play this back
while I try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about
how the funds once came
then I ran across this memory
and it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
That's a savage you're the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why I rhyme above average and
I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be

If I should die don't cry my niggas

In the middle of the trial I flip pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas

I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar Picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers

Rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me

Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Don't get it twisted like rays if I miss that's okay
But life's short don't miss a day

If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas, bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real

One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit
Oh hey ma, how you, know niggaz wanna buy you
But see me I wanna _Fuck for Free_ like Akinyele
Now I gotta let her take this ride, make you feel it

Only wife of mines is a life of crime
And since, life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death
That's life's a nigga, long as life prevent us
We gonna send a lot and pray to Christ forgive us
Fuck it
Ice the wrists and raise the price on these niggaz
Y'all cant floss on my level
I'll invite you all to get wit us if ya ball is glitter
When I go all the harlem playaz wall my picture
If you get close enough you can read the scripture
It reads money cash hoes how real was that nigga what
Money cash hoes money cash hoes (WHAT)

One: Jay-Z

Growin up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?
He said, Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home.
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleachin your dome, you're reachin
I said, The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on.
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggaz is two-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case

Come experience, life as we know it
As some of you should know it, yeah, yeah
Place, Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions, well, y'all know the actions

Uh, I got this shorty on my block always clockin' my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he sees my money talkin'
To honies hawkin', I'm the hottest nigga in New York

And I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again

I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody wanna be like Michael
Where I'm from, just them niggaz who bounce from a gun

We out here trying to make hard white into cold green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus, I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

It's time to come up, and hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush, stand my ground
It's time to come up, stick up my chest and make some loot
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand on my own two

I'm out here slingin' bringin' the drama, tryin' to come up

If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand
would you RIDE THEN, if I wasn't Drivin?
If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
put your two lips on my wood and kiss it - could ya
see yourself with a nigga workin harder than 9 to 5
contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
do you need a BALLA? So you can shop and tear the MALL UP?
Brag, tell your friends what I BOUGHT YA
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low

Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores

Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big moved

Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin

Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain

Couldn't drink the Henny straight

Nowadays, I throw shots back, leavin' nuttin' to waste

Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin' 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars an' hot women

If it's not him, then you got it confused

My motto is simply 'I will not lose'
Abide by the block rules, I buy my glocks used
Wit bodies on it, let me know, anybody want it?

I'm raised, ill rational, way misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, been one with the hood

You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill 3 quarts of my blood into the street
Let alone the heat
Fuck em, they hate a nigga loving this life
In all possible ways, just know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital dazed, reflecting when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said "pray for me"
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothing but time

And papayas, from the village to the tele

In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct

Y'all niggaz is pumpkin pie, and that's plain as I
much better than you cat, shocked when I got the news that

Especially those that get fucked for they publishing, heh

Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's O.K. round this bitch
I gotta talk to the natives, let 'em know I'm here
For all to get the pay days, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya
If so, jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya, that's right!

I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down

If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
I'm from the hood, stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like "Fuck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Year's '94 and my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or, hmm,
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I could fight the case

Tryin to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grip'n my balls

All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pots

You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot so

But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots?

Came in the Range, hopped out the Lexus
Every year since, I been on that next shit
Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes
Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records
Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner
Now I rock a tailored suit, looking like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones
I move onward, the only direction
Can't be scared to fail in the search of perfection
Gotta keep it fresh girl, even when we sexing
But don't be mad at him when it's on to the next one

Freeze, somebody bring me back some money please

You take the clothes off my back, and I let you
You steal the food right out of my mouth
And I watch you eat it, I still don't know why
Why our love is so much
Ohhh
You curse my name, in spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
Yeah

And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sipping from the cup till it runneth over, (uh, uh) Holy Grail

Uh, Blue told me remind you niggas
Uh, fuck that shit y'all talk about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamnit, I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, 30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame, Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

Let's make love on a million, in a dirty hotel
With the fan on the ceiling, all for the love of drug dealing
Marble Floors, gold Ceilings
Oh what a feeling, fuck it I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of

They don't understand is because we really from Africa
And that's where all this stuff come from
And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying
So don't look down on the youngsters
Because they wanna have shiny things
It's in our genes, know what I'm saying

Go ahead and watch the sun blaze

Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatantly ballin' on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww isn't she lovely
Now I'm staring at praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody
I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me

High on life
I could die from the fall
Imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order
To Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me

Success is so sublime
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind
Something 'bout the struggle so divine
This sort of love is hard to define
When you scratching for every nickel and dime
Got me itching to do this shit for my mom

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah ma, your dude is back,
The Maybach roof is back
Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't got to argue about who could rap
Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps
New York, New York! yeah where my troopers at?
Where my hustlers? where my boosters at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued you back to the wall
You gotta brawl through that
I been through that,
been shot at shoot back
Gotta keep it peace like a buddhist
I ain't a New Jack nobody 'gon Wesley Snipe me
It's less than likely, move back
Let I breathe Jedi knight
The more space I get the better I write
(Oh) Never I write, but, if, ever I write
I need the space to say whatever I like, now just

You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah

If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

[Notorious B.I.G. interview]
I'm just, tryin to stay above water y'know
Just stay busy, stay workin
Puff told me like, the key to this joint
The key to staying, on top of things
is treat everything like it's your first project, knahmsayin?
Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, yes, yes
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop
Let me tell you pe-eople why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out sellin dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some "Just +Me, Myself and I+"
On some Trugoy shit
Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned

[Chorus]
It's my life - it's my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first

If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
I'm from the hood, stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like "Fuck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son

In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law

My women friend get tennis bracelets
Trips ta Venice, get their winters replaced with...
The sun, it aint even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man it's just da game, I just play it to play it
Put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without sayin' a word, the ghettos got a mental telepathy
Man my brother hustled, so naturally, up next is me
But what perplexes me
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play

To change my approach, stop shavin coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast

Listen close you hear what I'm about, nigga feel my truths

When pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doin' heroin and me doin' crack sales
With that in the egg shell standin' at the tabernacle
Rather the church pretendin to be hurt, wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like damn that mans face is just like my face

So pop I forgive you for all the shit that I live through
It wasn't all your fault, homie you got caught
And to the same game I fault that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other, save a place in Heaven

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck

Lord forgive him

But he also got a righteous cause for sinnin'
Them a murder me so i gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performin procedures

I ain't tryin to be facetious
But "Vengance is mine" said the Lord
You said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door
Breathin off res-por-rators

On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Mabach Benz
Flier than Sanaa Lathan

Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards

Now it's a duet, and you wet, when you check out
the technique from the 2 tecs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet you dumb shit
This is a un-usual musical I conduc' it
You lookin at the black Warren Buffett so all critics can duck sic

Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rylin me up
For three years, they had me peein out of a cup
Now they bout to free me up, whatchu think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th
Weighing in at ten pounds, eight ounces
He was the last of my four children
The only one who didn't give me any pain, when I gave birth to him
And that's how I knew, that he was a special child

"Hi baby, what's wrong? You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me, is it something that I've done again?
You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me."

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
They say they never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone
So on that note I'm leavin after this song
See you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnus Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me, a more sicker MC and my momma would claim
At ten pounds when I was born I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose was on purpose, I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
Now I'm just scratchin the surface cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on

There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood
Or this pop, this hot
Or this strong
With so many different flows
This ones for this song
The next one I'll switch up
This one will get bit up
These fucks
Too lazy to make up shit
They crazy
They don't... paint pictures
They just trace me
You know what
Soon they forget where they plucked
They whole style from
And try to reverse the outcome
I'm like... tough
I'm not a biter
I'm a writer
For myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse I'm only biggin up my brother
Biggin up my borough
I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough
Plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about
Bring em out
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth
I'm in... New sneakers
Deuce seaters
Few Diva's
What more can I tell you
Let me spell it for you

And I ain't never been to jail;
I ain't never pay a nigga to do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands to himself
or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt,

Trips ta Venice, get their winters replaced with...
The sun, it aint even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man it's just da game, I just play it to play it
Put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without sayin' a word, the ghettos got a mental telepathy
Man my brother hustled, so naturally, up next is me
But what perplexes me
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play
the starrin role in "Hovito's Way"

[Chorus]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shavin coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast

[Notorious B.I.G. interview]
I'm just, tryin to stay above water y'know
Just stay busy, stay workin
Puff told me like, the key to this joint
The key to staying, on top of things
is treat everything like it's your first project, knahmsayin?
Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, yes, yes
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop
Let me tell you pe-eople why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out sellin dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some "Just +Me, Myself and I+"
On some Trugoy shit
Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned

[Chorus]
It's my life - it's my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first

But I don't fuckin feed em
First time they fuss I'm breezin
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe em
In the cut where I keep em
til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
so you can be livin it up? Shit I.

Not for nothin, never happen

I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
It took shortsleeves and loungin' to understand
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you

Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps

Where my hustlers? where my boosters at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued you back to the wall
You gotta brawl through that

Gotta keep it peace like a buddhist

This time it's for the money my nigga

There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood
Or this pop, this hot
Or this strong
With so many different flows
This ones for this song
The next one I'll switch up
This one will get bit up
These fucks
Too lazy to make up shit
They crazy
They don't... paint pictures
They just trace me
You know what
Soon they forget where they plucked
They whole style from
And try to reverse the outcome
I'm like... tough
I'm not a biter
I'm a writer
For myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse I'm only biggin up my brother
Biggin up my borough
I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough
Plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about
Bring em out
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth
I'm in... New sneakers
Deuce seaters
Few Diva's
What more can I tell you
Let me spell it for you

And I'm back for more

But for now let me get back to this paper

Yeah I'm talkin' five comma six zeros dot zero

Swear to God I just touched down
All around the world (same song)
Killa Cali nigga (same song)
A-T-L (same song)
Real-adelphia. dude it's all around the world
London, England, South of France
And all points between they know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan
I'm a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am
piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap', or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like weed
Your man'll stand manta ray, handlin a steak
And handlin the modern stand about five-eight
Five-nine fine wine fine dine either that
or I'm mixin in Switzerland, tryin to buy time
Ballin out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin at the 4 Seasons, off the heezy
When it's back home nigga back to the zone
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me
All around the world. (same song)

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

We arose, let's go
So fresh so clean like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin' tags
Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin' bout hoes and dough again
Yup! Can't hold it in

I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend
But I was holdin' in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?

Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin'
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma

You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know hoe be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll wit your boy you'll be poppin tags

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin' like a nigga that just came up on a mill
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the floor

You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)

Why not? -- You should be comin home with me
Sittin in this lap with the luxury
Now you can, come in the mornin while wakin up (Yeah!)

Yes. a lime to a lemon, my V-A women

She wanna wrinkle my linens
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin, uhh
Blasphemy, oh my God, we be sinnin
She keeps scratchin me like she tiger in 'em
This is exactly, why I had to pin her
to the bed like a wrestler, her to press on her, uhh
Her man kept pagin, stressin her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her
(Situations. will arise, but you gotta be smart about it)
No matter what you do, don't talk about us
Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
Bring a friend!

Of a revolutionary Jay Guevero

Now it's a whole museum of Hov' Mcers
Everybody dupin' the flow you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like you tryin' to make 'The Blueprint 2 before Hov'

Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kan-Yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin', glancin' every chance they get
Like oh shit, he's so handsome

Still in demand in the longest run standin'
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin' to Canton, I'm now eligible

Point out the bounce
And show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts till it's hard to count

Point out the bounce

To a whole ki to the R.O.C

Would make a mistake on the who know it stayed still in the way
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now there's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action

Turn my music high, high, high, high-er

I'm from the streets where the
Hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow a man
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities crash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street homes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip you are now gone
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return 'em
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hopping out the back of van
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it
Was clapping them flamers before I became famous
For playing me y'all shall forever remain nameless

Then they love me again

Lets take a trip down

Lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live
It's this line damn him already
Such a goodkid got us poring Hen(nessy) already
Liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
When it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name? shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him could save him
He put his faith in the 38 in his waist
But when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate

Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker
Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
Some day the cops will kill a motherfucker
I don't always want to be this drug dealing motherfucker damn
Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet
Ride through the sky, I used to play the hall up fifth floor me
And my boys we all poor getting high

I seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing

I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park

And still I grew some how
I knew the sun will shine through
And touch my soul take hold of my hand
Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn

Some how, some way

Other side you got the soldier
Getting ready for boot camp

They're both at war

Stay with us

Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast?
So don't you worry about what you see, it will pass

You lost him mama, the war's callin' him
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them, he's a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta

Now just remember while he's going to November
There's part of him growing up
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya
Your heart beatin' so fast speeding his pulse up

Make up, and break up
That's all we do
Then we have sex, next thing you know
Everything is cool
Best of Both Worlds! Holla at your boy

Like we always do about this time
Uh-huh, yeah
I know what you doin ma
Tryin to get in an argument with me so I can
Do my mad thing, you want me to do my mad thing
I understand - c'mon!

Seems we're always arguing, but
Right after the arguing we have, sex
And somehow it's the best, yes
Seems we're always arguing, but
Right after the arguing we have, sex
And somehow it's the best girl

Gangsta love, gangsta love

Think about it while the streets you roam
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home
Sex is always better fresh off a vendetta
We break up or break you off then we right back together
Then this brand new leathers and Caroline Aurera
Marijuana, white wine, somewhere under the weather
Like we sick but we fine, shit we couldn't feel better
Just some sunshine in mind lookin fine as ever

Dear God, bring our P-O-Ws home
And our brothers on lockdown, home
AMEN!!!

JEAH!!! Back blocked on everybody laptop
(HOV) Hittin' niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin'
(KELL) Oh yeah da niggas is comin' get out ya good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving
(HOV) And non other than da "R" and without further a due like Freddy get ready it's ...

Whatever happen Lord, dont pass me by
Cause whenever I did wrong it was ya name I cried
I heard you forgave over and over again
But when I found out I love you, you became ammune to my sins
Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep (I see dead people)
And sometimes it's me Lord
I never wanted to be a thug father
I only wanted to be a son of a father
That's how it sounds inside, worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I
I gave up da weed and somehow Im still high
Three years still seein' them three guys Lord (Whoo)
Sometimes I dont know what you want from me, but I do know you know what I want from you
(Give it to me)
(Come on) Take away this Hennessey, take away me runnin' da streets
Stop people from rapin' me, take away all this jealously and prejudicy
Lord you said it was better place, I grew up around pimps, hustlers, hoes and project gates
Its HARD TO BELIEVE in what I cant see

Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I've stopped
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come

Yo, gather round hustlers that's if you still livin
And get on down, to that ol' Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high

Mouthpiece for hustlers I'm back motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude he's teflon

So she call me cabron plus marricon
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, "Un momento" mami, slow up your tempo
I got this Black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin' out her neck, makin' her fingers snap
She like, "Listen Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap

I got this French chick that love to french kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
My, cherie amor, tu es belle
Merci, you fine as fuck but you givin' me hell
I got this Indian squaw the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather
She said "All you need to know is I'm not a ho."
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and Black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn I'm gettin' fat

Turn my music high, high, high, high-er

I'm from the streets where the
Hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow a man
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities crash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street homes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip you are now gone
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return 'em
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hopping out the back of van
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it
Was clapping them flamers before I became famous

Damn though mans I'm just tryin do me
If the record's two mill' I'm just tryin move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll menage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggaz I don't mean to ruffle y'all

We shoulda been together havin 4 Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

Geah

See I was -- born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit - I kept arms
38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid
Shit, I'm goin through it - mom dukes too
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is gettin too wild
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
Bout to lose it; voices screamin "Don't do it!"
It's like '93, '94, bout the year
that Big and Mag dropped; and "Illmatic" rocked
outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doin 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block
like "Damn; I'ma be a failure"
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug - paraphenalia
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!

Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel

Before me there was many, after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin'

Yeah, I get it down, anxiously the public can't wait
Niggaz had to have it way before its release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight

Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take

I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggaz up settin' my Mama
Arrested, put in the line-up, tryin' to put dents in my armor

But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty though, still ridin' with toast
I ain't tryin' to collide with folk, but I don't want folk takin' Jigga for joke
I guess you niggaz just woke, good morning!

You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
(Jigga, Kelly, not guilty)
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
(I got, all, my mamis)
I've got all of my mamis
(Tell me, what you, want from me)
Tell me, what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

I see how you comin' at me now, I'm cool
I'm not the snitch, I don't go to the cops to get rich
I go to the block and pitch
I go with the glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
I go with you hard, I ain't gon' stop for shit

Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?

Yea standin' knock right here
You fuck around not have the right speakers in your system
Your shit be soundin' like this

Big things, thick chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four dot six range
Shit mayn, switch slanes every town I hit you
Switch slames bitch flip big caine

I givin' 'em whiplash when I'm whippin' the whip fast
Which one pick one nigga I gotta six stashed
Continental T's no tense like I got a thick stab
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it is so funny

Six-four switches, slam doors on sixes
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill

Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'm a pull out the yard
They know I come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin' to pull menage

Just Mac is God the sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
'Cause I push Black Porsches, Benzes and Jaguarses

When the rag's off it gat on my lap I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sittin' on twenties they get nauseous
Standin' in the azure with white air forces

You can catch me in the parkin' lot
Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin'

Holla you keep a gun and you bust for beef
Holla if you real and you know you a G
Holla deep in these streets when you pumpin' that D
Holla be in your hoods screamin' fuck police
Holla you keep a gun and you bust a beef

Niggas say I'm focused now, they know that's my style
But dogg, I'm on the block with that coke and a smile
I still got the crack heads ID
And they know, I collect for the first and fifteenth
I still take cabs to that capsule spot
For them 31 illusions and them purple tops
And the game ain't change, niggas is taught different
I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slippin'

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
What's the problem shorty?

Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me

Alright; hold on - Hova, line one

Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
but I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla {*click*, *dial tone*}

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
Whassup Sig? This Chris out the Young Guns dog
Whattup?
I'm ready to smash these niggaz in the rap game
The niggaz takin too long with that advance money and shit

Like you always shot at sumthin', niggaz never shot at nuthin'

You niggaz talk shit like you draw quick

Your man bullshit? Might get him four quick
All up in his fore shit, c'mon, stop the bullshit

Straight out da school yard, Hoover, I schooled y'all
Now school's out, lights out, tools out
You fools out, c'mon, y'all pick a new route

While I pick the new flow, kick it to your new ho'
To get next to your new dough
Your new crack spot, you know Mac steal crack to crack pot
Niggaz, know I spit on every track hot

Mmm, you don't understand now be.cause you're cryin, and you hurt
You'll understand soon enough. soon enough

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
[Jay-Z]
You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small
Shit I watched you mature - nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin a guy
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me
{You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know}
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be
if they found that you was huggin me
My conscience is fuckin with me

Cuz when I pull up, always pop, that's why I'm livin today

Yo, when I meet ya, I heat ya down
When I greet ya, meet ya with pound
Not the handshake, but the kind that make ya demand a wake
The kind that put land over your face
I pop ya, let doctors stitch ya
I-N-F-R-A, will not miss ya
I move light, like my shoes too tight
Leave niggas confused from the day to the night
At night, see the light, when the pistol's sparkin
Daytime it gets dark when that pistol barkin
I keep cash 'case cops arrest me
'case kids kidnap me, kids could get back me
You shall repent 'fore you spend a red cent
If not you, somebody of close descent
Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Correy

Damn how am I gonna say this shit, hey
Hey Dad, yeah it's your boy
Remember me, I wanna talk to you scrap

I remember being kicked out the house, 'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook just like you
The niggaz in the hood was shook where the just like you
'Cause all they said was little whitey look, I'm just like you

But dog I can't see it at all, shit, we never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit, how to fight, ride a bike, fix the flat
None of that sorts of shit, nigga you was an abusive pops
Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach news to box, gotta teach news to block

And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach news to block
It's about time we have a father to son nigga sit down
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters, nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
Never follow your orders

Nigga you make me sick, pussy you could, ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin' my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out
The reason why I hit the block

Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hittin' shots
Reason why I started gettin' licked

Fellow Americans, It is with the upmost pride and sincerity that i present this recording as a militestament and recollection of history in the making during our generation.

(Jay-Z)

Allow me to re-introduce myself, My name is HOV
H to the O-V, I used to move snowflakes by the O.Z.
I guess even back then you can call me
C.E.O of the R.O.C HOV
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number 1 supplier
Flier than a piece or paper bearing my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, thats right HOV
Not D.O.C, similar to the letters no one can do it better
I check cheddar like a food inspector

Feel it comin' in the air

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now

Is who's gon' run this town tonight (everybody bounce, come on)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town

We are
Yeah I said it
We are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on
All black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds
Ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is La Familia
I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma six zeros dot zero
Here Doug
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas
Now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight

You ready B? Let's go get 'em

Look for me, Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend

So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

[Verse One]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
with no pen just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS

Jigga-Man, Volume 3, I'm back lookin like me
Stop the presses, baby girls, drop your dresses
B-K lick a shot for Big Pop' in heaven
Ever since I came through, niggaz got the impression
everything I drop, out of the question, stop the guessin
it's hot, flows provin I pack cause my dough's movin
My whole crew up in this muh'fucker
We spray corners, stand there like you got a cape on ya, fine
You'll be wearing a black suit a long time
I put your crew in hard bottoms
The priest is like, "God's got him
He never did nuttin to nobody but them boys shot him"
Brandish iron, outlandish buyin

Think there's been a murder
Oh yeah, I think there's been a
I think there's been a
Think there's been a murder
Oh yeah, think there's been a
I think there's been a

I hustle from, night to mornin', dawn to dusk
Kidnap and robberies like you goin' with us
I held round table meetings so we could go on and discuss
Not only money but all the emotions goin' through us
Why we don't cry when niggaz die? That's how the street raised him
Look in the air, say a prayer hopin' God forgave him
Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement
We live dangerous, often findin' ourself in the eyes of strangers

My dream is big and in it my team is rich
As seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit
Back to live action, I'm packin', I'm still in the mix
Like new hits, I think I'm goin' over your head a lil' bit
But I let you know I changed names when I roam through town
Stay free and be who I'm professional known as now
Jay motherfuckin' Z, and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead

Think there's been a murder

Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (everybody bounce, come on)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town

Pledge your allegiance

Black cards, black cars

If you boys really real enough
This is La Familia

But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma six zeros dot zero

Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas
Now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care

Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind

Say a nigga name and the car start
Nigga switching lane to lane like Wal-Mart
Sippin Bordeaux out in Bordeaux

Switch my old bitch for my new bitch
Cause my new bitch something like a nympho
Fuck the game raw when I came in it
Getting money ever since I came in it

Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Throw your diamonds in the sky
If you feel the vibe

The ROC is still alive
Every time I rhyme
(Forever and ever!)
For ever, ever? For ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam
Still, people lose hands, legs, arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' bout the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' bout Roc-a-fella, my home, my chain
These ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob?
Don't lie to me man
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',
How? when I know of the blood diamonds
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs

I'm making short term goals, wonder whether foes
just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy
high stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
shopping sprees, coping three, deuce fever I guess its fully loaded,
ah yes,
bouncing in the lex luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 g's to the crap shooter,
niggas can't fade me
chrome socks beaming, through my peripheral I see ya scheming
stop dreamin', I leave ya body steaming
niggas is feening, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening with the sound of my money machine-in
my cuff running over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it
six digits and running,
y'all niggas don't want it
I got the godfather flow, the don Juan Demarco
swear to god, don't get it fucked up

taking out this time
to give you a piece of my mind
(cause you can't knock the hustle)
but though you think you are
baby one day you'll be a star

last seen out of state where I drop my slang
I'm deep in the south kicking up top game
bouncing on the highway switching 4 lanes
screaming through the sun roof money ain't a thang

Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related

While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him

To the death of us: me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill 3 quarts of my blood into the street
Let alone the heat
Fuck em, they hate a nigga loving this life
In all possible ways, just know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital dazed, reflecting when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said "pray for me"
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process

Maybe it's for the best though, 'cause when they're seeing too much
You know they're trying to get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldn't understand the
mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine to five is how to survive, I ain't trying to survive
I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills, poison my body
I used to say 'fuck mic skills,' and never prayed to God, I prayed to
Gotti
That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, endz
I break bread with the late heads, picking their brains for angles on

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib at a sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner

The same rules apply, don't try to switch up your style
Y'all niggaz is pumpkin pie, and that's plain as I
much better than you cat, shocked when I got the news that
this nigga ready for war, well where that fool at?
I bruise wack rap niggaz severely punish them
Especially those that get fucked for they publishing, heh
Always gotta be the weakest nigga out the crew
I probably make more money off yo' album, than you
You see the respect I get everytime I come through
Check your own videos, you'll always be number two

Nigga what, nigga who
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe

Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous
Shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to po-po's
Smoke em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit
Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga laying shocked when the bullet hit
Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay Z you're too much for me

(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z

Turn the lights all the way down
So make me flow
J-A-Y: I flow sick
Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
I spits the game for those that throw bricks
Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks
Sex, murder and mayhem - romance for the street
Only wife of mines is a life of crime
And since life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death?
That's life's enigma, long as life's within us
We gonna sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us
Fuck it!
Ice the wrists and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level!
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: money, cash, hoes. How real was that nigga?
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (What!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (Uhh!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (C'mon)

and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo
Beyotch!
Growin up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleachin your dome, you're reachin

See yourself with a nigga workin' harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or

Couldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin to chase

Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin nothin to waste
Life is like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place
Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past

Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
Blood dripping on me looking like a nigga stabbed him

Laughing at you fuck niggas getting madder
If I feel threatened, I'mma go and get a ladder
And climb up your chest, nigga, motherfuck your vest, nigga

But dog they be takin' me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle

That's what I tied my hands like an Iraqi hostage

Let niggas take shots at me no response
I just flip and pop my collar like the fons
You give a nigga a foot he'll take you one step beyond
He'll try to play you twice the third time is the charm

You wanna conversate with the writer of the Quran
Or old testament don't test him then

And I got mental vision, intuition

When the streets is talkin' niggas is gossipin'
Bitches all in your shit what's the cause of it?
I need to know

You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin'
And I only use his waist to keep my glock in
But when shit goes down you know who's doin' the poppin'
And if you don't know guess who's doin' the droppin'

Geah

See I was born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit, I kept arms
38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs, arms through it or stuffed with embalmin' fluid
Shit, I'm goin' through it, mom dukes too
Tears streamin' down her pretty face, she got her palms to it

My life is gettin' too wild
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
Bout to lose it, voices screamin', "Don't do it!"
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year that Big and Mag dropped
And "Illmatic" rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doin' 'em, I'm still scratchin' on the block
Like "Damn, I'ma be a failure"

Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug, paraphenalia
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Tryin' figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin'
So they can send shots straight to your melon, wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon

You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
but I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

Mmm, you don't understand now be.cause you're cryin, and you hurt
You'll understand soon enough. soon enough
[Singer overlaps Jay-Z]
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
[Jay-Z]
You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small
Shit I watched you mature - nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin a guy
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me
{You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know}
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be
if they found that you was huggin me
My conscience is fuckin with me
[Singer]
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand

That's why I, squeeze first ask quesions last
That's how most of these so called gangstas pass
I, squeeze first ask questions last
Cuz when I pull up, always pop, that's why I'm livin today

[JIGGA]
Yo, when I meet ya, I heat ya down
When I greet ya, meet ya with pound
Not the handshake, but the kind that make ya demand a wake
The kind that put land over your face
I pop ya, let doctors stitch ya
I-N-F-R-A, will not miss ya
I move light, like my shoes too tight
Leave niggas confused from the day to the night
At night, see the light, when the pistol's sparkin
Daytime it gets dark when that pistol barkin
I keep cash 'case cops arrest me
'case kids kidnap me, kids could get back me
You shall repent 'fore you spend a red cent
If not you, somebody of close descent
Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Correy

Damn how am I gonna say this shit, hey
Hey Dad, yeah it's your boy
Remember me, I wanna talk to you scrap

I remember being kicked out the house, 'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook just like you
The niggaz in the hood was shook where the just like you
'Cause all they said was little whitey look, I'm just like you

But dog I can't see it at all, shit, we never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit, how to fight, ride a bike, fix the flat
None of that sorts of shit, nigga you was an abusive pops
Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach news to box, gotta teach news to block

And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach news to block
It's about time we have a father to son nigga sit down
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters, nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
Never follow your orders

Nigga you make me sick, pussy you could, ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin' my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out
The reason why I hit the block

Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hittin' shots
Reason why I started gettin' licked

Fellow Americans, It is with the upmost pride and sincerity that i present this recording as a militestament and recollection of history in the making during our generation.

(Jay-Z)

Allow me to re-introduce myself, My name is HOV
H to the O-V, I used to move snowflakes by the O.Z.
I guess even back then you can call me
C.E.O of the R.O.C HOV
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number 1 supplier
Flier than a piece or paper bearing my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, thats right HOV
Not D.O.C, similar to the letters no one can do it better
I check cheddar like a food inspector

Feel it comin' in the air

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now

Is who's gon' run this town tonight (everybody bounce, come on)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town

We are
Yeah I said it
We are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on
All black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds
Ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is La Familia
I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma six zeros dot zero
Here Doug
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas
Now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight

You ready B? Let's go get 'em

Look for me, Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend

Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

[Verse One]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
with no pen just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS

Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key

This is anti-AutoTune, death of the ringtone
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song

Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies

Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression

If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son

I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
I'm from the hood, stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like "Fuck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Year's '94 and my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or, hmm,
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I could fight the case

Hola my dominicanos (hey yo)
Right there up on Broadway
Brought me back to that McDonalds
Took it to my stash spot
560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen
Like Simmons whipping Pastry
Cruising down 8th Street
Off-white Lexus
Driving so slow
(but bk, it's from Texas!!)
Me I'm out that Bedstuy
Home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard
And I brought my boys with me
Say what up to ta-ta
Still sipping mai tais
Sitting courtside
Knicks and Nets give me high-5
Nga, I be spiked out
I could trip a referee
...tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from...

Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby

Look.
Mind state of a gangster from the ’40s.
Meet the business mind of Motown’s Barry Gordey.
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40s.
Sorry my jewellery’s so Gordie.
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauries.
America, meet the gangster, Shawn Corey.
Hey, young world, wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you could pretend you’re me.
I’m cut from the cloth of the Kennedy’s.
Frank Sinatra havin’ dinner with the Genovese.
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America’s not witnessed since,
The Harlem Renaissance birthed black buisnesses.
This is the tale of lost innocence.
As the incense burn and the turntables turn and that Al Green plays,
I see my mother’s afro as mama taps her toes as she rose her Js.
And my poppa just left the house in search of the killer of my uncle, Ray.
And she’s tryna calm my nerves, as I observe.
This is just one day.
And what tomorrow has in store,
We can never be sure so all we can do is
…Pray.

Because of Your strength, while I walked upon Thee.
For God is my defense.

Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out

We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreamin' in my La-Z-Boy

In the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin' 'bout Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starvin'
Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target

I got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those

Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley

Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter

Sweet!
And still there's pain
If I would have grew up to be a doctor, my nephew would have grew up to do the same
But since I grew up through the game, and my influence is the same
And my therapy is music, they ask if you ashamed
And though I wish I could separate, two things, 
I cannot, so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the hall or mirrors, in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look a myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir, just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coup like I'm wearing the roadster,
For any coup I'm bear hugging the holster.

Hov, alright, alright

If I didn't when we cuttin', the feelin' would be too strong
In any form, I'm givin' you sweet dreams

That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing
That Black Rain that take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein

Now that feelin' got you trippin', you no wanna feel no different
Said lust has got you itchin' all wide open and its' drippin'
I know what you like, I am your prescription
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction

And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know

Oh...
I like the party life...
Break Out The Red Lights
The city in bright lights
Welcome To The Party Life
These girls dressin' skintight...
Welcome to the 70's-Sweet!

Ordered some Patreezy
While talkin' to this breezy
Brushin' off my three-piece, I make this look too easy
So tall and lanky, my suit?
It should thank me
I make it look good to be this hood, Meyer Lansky
Look what Lucky left me
Gangster, effortlessly
Poppa was a rolling stone-it's in my ancestry
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me
And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY

(Baby I, I said I sport fly shit, I should win the Espy...
I'm really in another league, babe...
I got a slick mouth, you might wanna roll with me,)

I'm on her bra strap, she's on my diiiick
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, that's my biiiitch
I be the boss of that, I'm on her shiiiit
So all you niggas fall back, I'll split ya wig
She's my little quarterback... ya dig?
Cause I'm all that in the sack... ya, ya dig?
I spoiled her
Foiled it if you fakin', Jack
She's used to million-dollar vacations
Fuck ya'll gon' do with that?

When you're blue
You got nothin' to do
(Ay, baby, see,...
When you're used to Filet Mignon,)
Head into the party life
(It's kinda hard to go back to Hamburger Helper...)
If you're feelin' low
We got to go
(It's your choice though, baby...)

Yes sir, just the sound of his voice is a hit
Y'all niggaz got me really confused out there
I make 'Big Pimpin'' or 'Give It To Me' one of those
Y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought provokin' shit y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one, follow

When them tops come down, chicks tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds

Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"That's him", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with or his chip amount

'Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada, baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, AC broke
'Bout to take another shower on my twenty-fifth hour

Spike Lee's everywhere, game on the flight
You might see me anywhere, day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night

I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's or Sprees
Laid back, Maybach's, don't even talk to me

This is that ignorant shit you like

I ain't waiting for life to start portrayin' em
It's twice as hard to get a job that's paying
So I ain't payin' attention to what you saying
Rain-drops keep falling on my brain
Constant in the drop, all flames
I'm so hot even if the weather change
I don't have no top, I'm insane
Remember darkskinned Jermaine?
Swayed in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same
Except I'm no lame and you gonna know my name
Before I go to work and feel my pain
Saying, I'm a bad guy, why's that?
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga, I react
Secretly though, I know you admire that
You wish you had the balls to fire back-
Say hello, uh, uh, hello, uh. uh
You wish you had the balls to fire back

I got these niggas breezy, don't worry about it
Let that bitch breathe!
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success
It sucks too much to stress
I guess I blew up quick, cause friends I grew up with
See me as a primi, but I'm not and my nut's big
I don't know what the fuss is
My career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable
I'm not to be fucked with, with shit
Let that bitch breathe!
I'm way too important to be talking extorting
Asking me for a portion is like asking me for a coffin
Broad daylight I off ya on switch
Ya not too bright, goodnight, long kiss,
Bye-bye, my reply, blah-blah
Blast burner then pass burner, to TyTy
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appettite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was I
Let that bitch breathe!

it's inevitable and I'm falling

said that i would've stop be-fore i even started
when i get to one brick, than the game i would depart with
got to one brick then i looked to the sky
like, sorry God i lied but give me one more try
got to two bricks new cars new whips
but, niggas never learn 'till they end up in the news clip
the irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
guess theres two sides to what, substance abuse is
can't stop won't stop innocents new shit
brand new convertibles im so ruthless
front row fight night see how big my tube is
fuck HD nigga see how clear my view is {Fallin'}
but theres a price for over doing it

Open your mind you see the circus in the sky

Whip it around, it still comes back hard.

For my niggas who slipped, became prisoners

The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining

To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby

On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back

We got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Everyday is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
Niggaz stay low, like six bowls of shit and gold
And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
And I hope you shine
See many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle

Foxy Brown
What? Jay-Z, what

I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me

You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me, they connivin' shit

The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent francs
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly, no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)

Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroudin' your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan

I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B and so I creep

Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you

Cruisin' down the Westside high, way
Doing what we like to do our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason

All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier

'Cuz Mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?

We still tote hammers that go blockow
Run up if you wanna, believe me dog
These hammers with they owners, fuck ya G up
Have ya with blue 'jamas in a coma, and

Ya family now moan, look, 70 pounds gone
A little fuck, scribbled up with a hospital down on

To get over, we prowl with slimmer re-shelled tactics

She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist

Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather
She said all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough

On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up

Foxy Brown
What? Jay-Z, what

I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me

You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me, they connivin' shit

The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent francs
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly, no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)

Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroudin' your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan

I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B and so I creep

Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Movin a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggaz to see
Time to start the arisin now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

It seems, I'm like Keenan, pickin up on the vibe
that he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividin the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matchin the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggaz think I fell out the loop
cause the last time they seen me hoppin, out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

Look at this nigga Jay frontin tryin to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce, more than I used to puff
Takin advice from these niggaz but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinkin, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
while he drive around town in brand new Coupe's and stufF"
Swear to God, they had me practically hatin his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga whattup?"

I done came up (uhh) put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?) no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
(uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)

Aiyyo Jay word up, these motherfuckers
Fuckin' talkin' that comeback shit like they cookin' crack
Shit I ain't frontin' all I want my pockets
Green like slum change you know what I'm sayin'?

Front the roll we roll back like rubbers motherfucker
For real, with no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella click nigga

Aiyyo we pattin' down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gaspin' for air in Aspen
Searchin' for aspirin when I ask then, we swing

You cling we do our thing and bring
Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast hostess hostile colossal, money flarin'
Like nostrils for drug dealin' apostles, huh

Al Pacino down to Nino Brown, Me Jay and Primo
Got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull

Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin' to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars

Star studded bitches with crystals, get fucked with pistols
Just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thang
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thang

Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Check the bassline out, uh huh
Jigga, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah
Let it bump though

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready

Uh huh
That's right
Uh huh uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh huh uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money, had the cars, the bitches
Uh huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry
And then my motherfuckin' niggaz started snitchin'
Uh huh, uh uh, yo
Beyotch

Growin' up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
The feds came to get me, we both fled quickly

Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home"

I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said, "The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on"
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe 'cause niggaz is two-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
It's on

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked, beyotch
(Uh huh, uh huh, it was all good just a week ago)

Come experience, life as we know it
As some of you should know it, yeah, yeah
Place, Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions, well, y'all know the actions

Uh, I got this shorty on my block always clockin' my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he sees my money talkin'
To honies hawkin', I'm the hottest nigga in New York

And I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again

I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody wanna be like Michael
Where I'm from, just them niggaz who bounce from a gun

We out here trying to make hard white into cold green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus, I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

It's time to come up, and hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush, stand my ground
It's time to come up, stick up my chest and make some loot
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand on my own two

I'm out here slingin' bringin' the drama, tryin' to come up

Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big moved
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin

Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit

Yeah, yeah, I'ma up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever

I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere

I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the Kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry

Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard, and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping mai tai
Sitting courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I am most definitely from

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though

She's right back to being my soldier

'Cuz Mami's a rider, and I'm a roller

"And the other night when I was, researching, what we were going to be discussing today, I came across a passage that, I think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was talking about, and that all things must come to an end.
It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence.

If your having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
I'm from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapitos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having doe
I'm like fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits well I don't give a shit SO
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads... fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to ritches nigga I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

Can I hit in the mornin'
Without givin' you half of my dough?
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things

Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then if I wasn't drivin'?

If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya

See yourself with a nigga workin' harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla? So you can shop and tear the mall up?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a fuck you to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
Can I get a woop woop to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Take it from the top

Now I just wanna love you, you know I love you
But be who I am, I know you love me
And with all this cash, you'll forget your man

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them

Drunk off Crist', Mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
"And I wish I never met her at all"

It gets better, ordered another round
It's about to go down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere

What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

Now give it to me

It was all a dream
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin through my head
It was all a dream
Felt so real to me
This is what was said

Had a dream I said, 'bout who he said?
'Bout B.I.G. I said, that's B, I.G. he said
Dig he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin'
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said
It came to me like a, well as even I said

"You feel playboy," was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"More money, more problems, better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said

I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before

Yeah, yeah, I'ma up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere

I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the Kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry

Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard, and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping mai tai
Sitting courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I am most definitely from

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though

Uh-huh, je-je je-je-jeah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah
How real is this, how real is this
Uh-huh huh, inspect this here, check

I'm from where the hammer's rung, news cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run

Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt there more something and you nothing check

I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up the town and then sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us

I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it

I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best Mc's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars

Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy Son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Better trust than believe 'em

Till I need a nut, till I need to beat the guts
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin' 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck

Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up

I'm a Tokyo giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap' or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like weed
Your man'll stand Manta Ray, handlin' a steak
And handlin' the modern stand about five eight
Five nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the Four Seasons, off the heezy
When it's back home nigga back to the zone
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me:
All around the world (same song)
Brooklyn bombers (same song)

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

We arose, let's go
So fresh so clean like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin' tags
Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin' bout hoes and dough again
Yup! Can't hold it in

I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend
But I was holdin' in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?

Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin'
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma

You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know hoe be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll wit your boy you'll be poppin tags

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags

It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin' like a nigga that just came up on a mill
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the floor

She wanna wrinkle my linens
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin, uhh
Blasphemy, oh my God, we be sinnin
She keeps scratchin me like she tiger in 'em
This is exactly, why I had to pin her
to the bed like a wrestler, her to press on her, uhh
Her man kept pagin, stressin her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her
(Situations. will arise, but you gotta be smart about it)
No matter what you do, don't talk about us
Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
Bring a friend!

Everybody dupin' the flow you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul

See how we adjusted the game so easy

Like oh shit, he's so handsome

Still in demand in the longest run standin'
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin' to Canton, I'm now eligible

Point out the bounce
And show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts till it's hard to count

Point out the bounce

To a whole ki to the R.O.C

Would make a mistake on the who know it stayed still in the way
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today

Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action

Rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live
It's this line damn him already
Such a goodkid got us poring Hen(nessy) already
Liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
When it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name? shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him could save him
He put his faith in the 38 in his waist
But when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate

Raw rough and rugged, when addressin the mass public

And fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters

And the one thing they got in common is pain

On one side we got a hustler
Getting ready for the block

Other side you got the soldier
Getting ready for boot camp
(Soldiers)
They're both at war
(This is life)
Stay with us

Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast?
So don't you worry about what you see, it will pass

You lost him mama, the war's callin' him
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them, he's a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta

Now just remember while he's going to November
There's part of him growing up
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya
Your heart beatin' so fast speeding his pulse up

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong

Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shoppin sprees, copin three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah yes

50 G's to the crap shooter, niggaz can't fade me

Through my perephreal I see ya schemin
Stop dreamin, I leave your body steamin
Niggaz is fiendin, what's the meanin?
I'm leanin on any nigga intervenin
with the sound of my money machine-in 
My cup runneth, over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and runnin
Y'all niggas don't want it, I got the Godfather flow
The Don Juan DeMarco; swear to God, don't get it fucked up

Foxy Brown
What? Jay-Z, what

I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me

You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me, they connivin' shit

The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent francs
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly, no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)

Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroudin' your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan

I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B and so I creep

And niggas who pump wheels and drive Jettas take that with ya

Hit ya back split ya fuck fist fights and layin scuffles
Pillow case to your face make the shell muffle
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related, most hate it

Can't fade it, while ya'll pump willy, I run up and stunt silly
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, let the paramedics breath all soft on him
What's ya name?

Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Tryin to put 700's, they ain't made them yet
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit

Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name

And just like your spirit the commission remains

Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm takin this rap shit serious, to my demise

Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit

I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores

I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big moved

How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now

My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin

Spill 3 quarts of my blood into the street
Let alone the heat
Fuck em, they hate a nigga loving this life
In all possible ways, just know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital dazed, reflecting when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said "pray for me"
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process

But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em the windows to his soul
Are half closed I put the key in

Pulled off slow hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib at a sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner

Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time, stress, givin' this shit up fuck

I give you a snotty nose from body blows
Nobody's safe at a party even Gotti goes adios
I got-got-got Flav-flav-flav-flavor, so save yours
One and it's a hearse, I played and I slayed yours
Get it, got it, ready to flip, I doubt it

Moon so bright night so fine
Keep your heart here with mine
Life's a dream we are dreaming
Race the moon catch the wind
Ride the night to the end
Seize the day stand up for the light
I want to spend my lifetime loving you

If that is all in life I ever do
Heroes rise heroes fall
Rise again, win it all

Lyrics to Jay Z/Rell F You're Only A Customer

Ha ha ha ha Roc a Fella y'all
Futuristic shit beeotch
Uh what the fuck? How we do. How we do. Uh ha

Triple platnum nigga with the solid gold fade
All that nickle and dime shit don't hold no weight
Fortune 5 top 5 in the Forbes (you'll see) as you
Thumb through the Source I read the Ride report
Class C cold me down with the plastic
That's all I Ask Of You, like Raphael Saadiq
At the hotel, Nico, robbin' the val suite
My people's eyes through the peep hole
I'm lovin' you down freak as I
Shoot through the city like a rumor
Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreadin' the news
Paper headin' read "Jay-Z breaths, 80 degrees"
the only thing to cool them off is a Malibu day breeze
Can't sop for the feds, say cheese
You know they wanna take a nigga picture
Pray for the day to get ya, but I'm a parlay and stay richer for now
Jigga hasn't done dirt in a while
YOu know my stomach getin' weak from livin' on the streets for real
Tryin' to oversee it from suites, orderin' eats
At the top where the criminal minds meet
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Check the bassline out, uh huh
Jigga, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah
Let it bump though

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready
...

Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit em wit, numerous
Shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots runnin to the Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin, glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit
And hey ma, how you, know niggaz wanna buy you
But see me I wanna Fuck for Free like Akinyele
Take this ride 'til you feel it inside ya belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

[Verse One]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS

I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)

The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you

Better trust than believe em

Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up

Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
so you can be livin it up? Shit I.

So she call me cabron plus marricon
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, "Un momento" - mami, slow up your tempo
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin out her neck, makin her fingers snap
She like, "Listen Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better - R-E-S-P-E-C-T me"
I got this French chick that love to french kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
_Ma cherie amore, tu es belle_
Merci, you fine as fuck but you givin me hell
I got this indian squaw the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather
She said all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn I'm gettin fat

Ya understand? Once you memorize a sentence
It's like an exercise (echoes)

*heavy breathing*

Ya niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all time heavy weight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now
Best flow, Most consistent, Realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter
Holla

I jog in the graveyard
Spar in the same ring
Now it's house by the building
Where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter
Round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me "Hova"
I'm far from being God
But I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds who in the nerves is sleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one end
I am "focused man"

Tears on the mauseoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest

Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek? "

People keep talkin' about "Hov, take it back!"
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothin' cool 'bout carryin' a strap
About worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat
Talkin' about revenge while carryin' his casket
All teary-eyed, about to take it to a mattress
I'm talkin' about music, I ain't talkin' about rap
You talkin' about who's hot, I ain't talkin' about that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map

[Jay-Z Talking]
Thank you, thank you very much
For comin' out this evening

[Verse 1]
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you
You're far too kind
Hold you're applause
This is your song not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Please hold your applause
For I just applied logic Keys keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, Opera, Black Tux, Binocula
Black luxe, Stop it I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up Face keep poppin' up
On the tube I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us
Sitting so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence How am I a Legend?
I just got 10 #1 albums Maybe now 11
More hits than a Now! 11
That is no reason to treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
Thank God, what a guy as I say my grace
Who woulda thought by making birds migrate
For the winter I be fly all summer Might I say

Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin...
Begin... begin

This is anti-AutoTune, death of the ringtone
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song

Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies

Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression

Ah, or your lack of aggression
Pull your skirt back down, grow a set men
Ah, ah... nigga this shit violent
This is death of AutoTune, ah moment of silence

La da da da... hey hey hey goodbye

Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (everybody bounce, come on)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town

We are
Yeah I said it
We are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on
All black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds
Ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is La Familia
I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma six zeros dot zero
Here Doug
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas
Now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight

Brought me back to that McDonalds
Took it to my stash spot

Catch me in the kitchen
Like Simmons whipping Pastry
Cruising down 8th Street

Me I'm out that Bedstuy
Home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard
And I brought my boys with me
Say what up to ta-ta
Still sipping mai tais
Sitting courtside

And I know you're 'bout to say this off the chain
Tell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane

See I ain't dead or in jail, I can't complain
And when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain
And if you just tunin' in, let me explain
You know I keep that 47 who??

These niggas way too far, I played the game
And if you listen hard enough I say some things
And when that sack got low, I shave them things
And put 'em right back together, I made them things

Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby

Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes
Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records
Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner
Now I rock a tailored suit, looking like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones

Gotta keep it fresh girl, even when we sexing

But I wear this on my plane in my runway clothes,
Cashmere sweats they come out next year

You about to tell her you love her we off that,
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that,

I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam 2
I had the 'Illmatic' on bootleg
Shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead

Wayne did a millie, 50 did a Millie
Ye too but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him

Yeah 3 in the morning on the Westside highway, top down baby,
F-ck y’all
The motivation for me was them telling me what I couldn’t be,
Oh well,

This a special dedication,
I wanna thank you for the fuel,
No really thank you,

I felt so inspired by what my teacher said,
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head,
Now sure if thats how adults should speak ta kids,
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class,
I teach his ass,
Even betters what my uncle did,
I pop my demo tape in start to beat my head,
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his,
He might as well say beat it kid, he’s on the list,
Its like Im searching for kicks like a sneaker head,
He gon keep pushing me until I reach the ledge,
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell em all to eat a d-ck,
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread,
Spread spread.

Oh well,

Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young, forever young (be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (but we ain't even thinkin' that far)

And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car

And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up
I bout to hit these niggas that'll light they life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger lookin gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?
I'm feelin it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin it feel the Lex pushin up on the set
I'm feelin it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin it if you feel it raise your l in the sky
Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin what shorty

This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak
We're all trying to win, but then again
Maybe it's for the best though, 'cause when they're seeing too much
You know they're trying to get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldn't understand the
mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine to five is how to survive, I ain't trying to survive
I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills, poison my body
I used to say 'fuck mic skills,' and never prayed to God, I prayed to
Gotti
That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, endz
I break bread with the late heads, picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us

Well we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation(live nigga)
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to servin
But we feel we have nothin to lose(everything to gain)
so we offer you, well, we offer our lives, (right)
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watchin every nigga watchin me closely
my shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
a brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from sellin 'caine
til brains was fried to a fricaisse, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
gettin my thug on properly, my squad and me
lack of respect for authority, laughin hard
Happy to be escapin poverty, however brief

I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me

You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me, they connivin' shit

The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent francs
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly, no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)

Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important

Whole game tighter now
Movin a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down

Time to start the arisin now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

It seems, I'm like Keenan, pickin up on the vibe
that he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividin the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matchin the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggaz think I fell out the loop
cause the last time they seen me hoppin, out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

Look at this nigga Jay frontin tryin to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce, more than I used to puff
Takin advice from these niggaz but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinkin, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
while he drive around town in brand new Coupe's and stufF"
Swear to God, they had me practically hatin his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga whattup?"

I done came up (uhh) put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?) no more second in line

Got it sewed across the board like Poquino

With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin' to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars

Star studded bitches with crystals, get fucked with pistols
Just to see my shit, discharge puss

Stress
Sunshine Geyeah

I sold it all from crack to opium in third person
I don't wanna see 'em so I'm rehearsin'
With my peoples high to GM from a remote location
In the BM scopin' the whole situation like "Dayamm!"

Metamorphic as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em the windows to his soul
Are half closed I put the key in

Pulled off slow hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib at a sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner

Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time, stress, givin' this shit up fuck

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

Steada treated, we get tricked

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy

Life, death, here, gone, yo

If I should die, don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas
Bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone, don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas, when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas

If I should die don't cry my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride my niggas
In the middle of the trial I flip pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas

I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar Picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers

Rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me

Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Don't get it twisted like rays if I miss that's okay
But life's short don't miss a day

If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas, bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas

If I should die don't cry my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride my niggas
Say word to Wais my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Just keep gettin' it on my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas

I got a lot to look back on in '88
Got my crack on ten years later gettin' my rap on
Gettin' shorties like a thespian
Had an episode with two lesbians, got a fetish for that

Growin up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?
He said, Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home.
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleachin your dome, you're reachin
I said, The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on.
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggaz is two-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case

He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again

I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's

That's just the natural cycle, nobody wanna be like Michael

We out here trying to make hard white into cold green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus, I can relive my days of youth which is gone

It's time to come up, and hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush, stand my ground

So we can make our points twice and skate out a town

Ladies screamin Jigga you know we ease that, flowin out like Jees-ass

And me I'm so into nice, got cats on the corner like

Nah, Not in your life ain't nobody copin like

Pimps all comin through with a hot pair of gators
And a crew with rocks the size of craters
Can't touch like hot potatoes, Ya Heard?

Yeah, yeah
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang
Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang
I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic

Why he's so mad for, why he gotta have it?
Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master

You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that. uuunnnh.

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky

Come, get some, you little bum
I take the cake but you can't get a crumb
from the poetic, authentic, superior
Ultimate - and all that good shit
I'm the original, Asiatic, acrobatic
There you have it, now get dramatic
Creatin drama when I'm on the scene
And I pack em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
put on trial a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just CRUMBLE
And I'm still calm and humble
You need another helpin hand to swing on
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on
your Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey
Starsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
that's for you not to come near, PERIOD
So I ain't buggin or delirious
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is
And I can slice and dice a Fisher Price MC
that thought he was nice into Minute Rice
Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff
Cause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
And the mic I ravage, not like a savage
but in my own way of doin damage
As I design the genuine line

We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us gettin mad, throwin' rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs

Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt (Yall can't fill my shoes)
From my Blueprint beginnings to my black album ending
If you listen close you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga feel my truths

Pop died didn't cry didn't know him that well
Between him doin heroin and me doin crack sales
Put that in an eggshell, standing at the tabernacle rather the church
Pretending to be hurt wouldn't work

So pop I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through

I'm from the hood, stupid; what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, fuck critics; you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits; well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas; I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me

The year is 94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or [(Hmm...)]
Bounce on the devil; put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars; I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road

My women friend get tennis bracelets
Trips ta Venice, get their winters replaced with...
The sun, it aint even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man it's just da game, I just play it to play it
Put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without sayin' a word, the ghettos got a mental telepathy
Man my brother hustled, so naturally, up next is me
But what perplexes me
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play

To change my approach, stop shavin coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast

The key to staying, on top of things

Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

Uhh, uhh, yes, yes
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop
Let me tell you pe-peeople why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out sellin dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some "Just +Me, Myself and I+"
On some Trugoy shit
Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned

It's my life - it's my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as - when I came

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th
Weighing in at ten pounds, eight ounces
He was the last of my four children
The only one who didn't give me any pain, when I gave birth to him
And that's how I knew, that he was a special child

"Hi baby, what's wrong? You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me, is it something that I've done again?
You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me."

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
They say they never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone
So on that note I'm leavin after this song
See you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnus Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me, a more sicker MC and my momma would claim
At ten pounds when I was born I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose was on purpose, I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
Now I'm just scratchin the surface cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on

They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Year's '94 and my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or, hmm,
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I could fight the case

Allow me to re-introduce myself, My name is HOV
H to the O-V, I used to move snowflakes by the O.Z.
I guess even back then you can call me
C.E.O of the R.O.C HOV
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number 1 supplier
Flier than a piece or paper bearing my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, thats right HOV
Not D.O.C, similar to the letters no one can do it better
I check cheddar like a food inspector

[Intro: Jay-Z Talking]
Uhh, this feel right right here Quik
It's like it's 'sposed to happen this one right here
Young! God damn.
. let me justify my thug on this one right here

[Verse One]
It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock rock
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, the party bout to pop
Then - (Roc-A-Fella y'all), it's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail;
I ain't never pay a nigga to do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands to himself
or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt,
I can't say I've never knelt before God
and asked for better cards at times to no avail

[Chorus/Intro]
Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of de morning...
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
(Kanyeeze you did it again, you a genius nigga!)
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning...
So you niggas change your attitude
For they askin what happened to you

[Verse One]
Lord forgive him
He got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinnin'
Them a murder me so i gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performin procedures
Jesus
I ain't tryin to be facetious
But "Vengance is mine" said the Lord
You said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door
Breathin off res-por-rators
for killin my best boy, HATERS
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Mabach Benz
Flier than Sanaa Lathan
Pumpin "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles
Like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been readin your Psalms and chapters

Young! It's da life...
Once again it's da life! Yess.
(I don't know why... I get so high on)
It's intoxicatin man... y'all don't know why you do what you do
(Get so high on(Yess). get so high(C'mon) - high off the life)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]

The allure of breakin' the law
It's always too much for me to ever ignore
I gotta thing for them big body Benzes... it dulls my senses
I'm in love with a V-dub engine
Mann I'm high off life- fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemar Piguet wrists
My women friend get tennis bracelets
Trips ta Venice, get their winters replaced with...
The sun, it aint even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man it's just da game, I just play it to play it
Put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without sayin' a word, the ghettos got a mental telepathy
Man my brother hustled, so naturally, up next is me
But what perplexes me
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play
the starrin role in "Hovito's Way"

[Chorus]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shavin coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast

[Notorious B.I.G. interview]
I'm just, tryin to stay above water y'know
Just stay busy, stay workin
Puff told me like, the key to this joint
The key to staying, on top of things
is treat everything like it's your first project, knahmsayin?
Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, yes, yes
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop
Let me tell you pe-eople why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out sellin dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some "Just +Me, Myself and I+"
On some Trugoy shit
Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned

[Chorus]
It's my life - it's my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first

Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight

Is who's gonna run this town tonight
We gonna run this town

We are, ya I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything

And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I'd get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper

I'm a couple bands down, and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave the other grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma, six zeros, dot zeros, here it go
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain

Look for me, Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
with no pen just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him

Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
"And I wish I never met her at all..."

This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song

Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects

This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies

Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression

This is death of AutoTune, ah moment of silence

You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot
Corners where we selling rock

Home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back

Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me

All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops

Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block

To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty

"Indeed", I said, so, breathe I did

"Don't repeat what I say", I said, he said nothin'
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a, well, as even I said

"You feel playboy", was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"More money, more problems, better believe it", he said
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it", he said

"I see", I said, "Jealousy", I said
"Got the whole industry mad at me", I said

Jeah. uhh. it's what I do for a livin nigga
Eat for a livin nigga (watcher)
That's how I live for a livin nigga. (watcher)
Okay, let's do this (the watcher)

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claimin they bangers
Doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespectin the game, no home trainin or manners
I was doin this shit when you was shittin Pampers
I was movin them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was
Duckin the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was
I was hittin the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers
I was prickin my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mill' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us comin through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fuckin with whom?
Allowed me to be taught
You cowards is just now learnin the shit that we talk
You niggaz ain't know about a Robb Report
Bout a high speed Porsche, i.e.
You niggaz ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door

You ready B? Let's go get 'em

Look for me! Young B
Cruisin' down the Westside high, way
Doing what we like to do our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason

All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier

'Cuz Mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, Mami is keepin' me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

Piss poor n_gga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap' or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like weed
Your man'll stand Manta Ray, handlin' a steak
And handlin' the modern stand about five eight
Five nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the Four Seasons, off the heezy
When it's back home n_gga back to the zone
N_gga back to the books to the rhymes that took me

But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin, about the dough I spend
But I was holdin in, I was a roller then

Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview

You see me cruisin down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride

Leave the mall with garbage bags

Such a goodkid got us poring Hen(nessy) already
Liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
When it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name? shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him could save him
He put his faith in the 38 in his waist
But when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate

Iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid
Shit, I'm goin through it - mom dukes too
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is gettin too wild
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
Bout to lose it; voices screamin "Don't do it!"

outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doin 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block
like "Damn; I'ma be a failure"

Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
but in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game
Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot
The topic of discussion in every nail shop
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
and within a week, watch your arm freeze up
Brassiere get right, A to a D cup
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
Ears get iced, gear get spiced
From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life
Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family

Jigga Man, mo' better, mo' cheddar

Remember me? The teachers used to fail us
Now it's mo' scrilla, hoe killers
Fo'-wheelers, we - gorillas
Oh please feel us - we heat holders
Fightin? Listen boy, Roy Jones couldn't still us
The plot thickens, the block clickin
We got the game tied up, stop trippin

Memph Bleek what? Amil-lion, uhh
Cat be him, El Cap-i-tan

Social Club, we unapproachable thugs
Non-social, gone postal
Great aim, harm the arm close to your toast
like a Don's supposed to, Shawn
I thought I told you, these ain't just vocals
Don't make me take it to the old school
I put holes through your hoes too
through your clothes to the foes to the nigga close to you
Fuck it; Jigga Man huh? Sigel Sigel y'all

Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we workin huh? Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin
Yeah, I get it down - anxiously the public can't wait
Niggaz had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
that what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin with toast
I ain't tryin to collide with folk,
but I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke
I guess you niggaz just woke - good morning!
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me. what y'all want from me?

Big thangs, thick chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four-dot-six Range
Shit mayn, switch lanes
Every town I hit you switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine
I givin 'em whiplash when I'm whippin the whip fast
Which one? Pick one nigga, I got a six stashed
Continental T's, no tense like I got a thick stab
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny
Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage
Just mackin this gorgeous; sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es
When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous
Standin in the Azure with white Air Forces
You can catch me in the parkin lot
Hollerin at bitches, parkin lot pimpin'

What's the problem shorty?

I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me

[Beanie Sigel]
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one

[Jay-Z]
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
but I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

[Shorty]
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars

You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small
Shit I watched you mature - nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin a guy
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me
{You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know}
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be
if they found that you was huggin me

Besides pimpin', you really ain't got the stomach for that

Nigga's beats is bangin', nigga your hooks did it
Your lyrics didn't, your gangsta look did it
So I would write it if y'all could get it
Bein intricate'll get you wood, critic
On the internet, they like you should spit it
I'm like you should buy it, nigga that's good business
Forget this rap shit I need a new hustle
A little bit of everything, the new improved Russell
I say that reluctantly cause I do struggle
As you see I can't leave so I do love you
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper

Yea your boy "ruthless", like Ice Cube was

Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm C.E.O. and yeah going god
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark

But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart

It's not a diss song, it's just a real song

I heard *** sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, "Okay, so make another Hov"
*** wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo

I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends, business interests as they go
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'

I shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a *** but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow *** up off him

And I ain't even want to be famous
*** is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I don't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man

It's stronger than heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, "There I am"
And still not see what you become
I know I'm guilty of it too but not like them
You lost one

And the object for us to explore our prospects
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!

Pointin at cars like yeah that's our six

So on some Dr. Spock shit, we STARted our TREK

In the name of those who ain't made it my progress

Yet grown enough not to put rims on it

Since we gotta be here life is but a beach chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me, "Are you happy, Hov?"
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair

I hear my angels sing

They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than eight seconds
Still poundin' in my after life laughin', my shit is tight
Who you askin', right?
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you betta)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Tell the freaks to find a man o' they own
Man o' they own, man o' they own
(Yea, yea)
Fresh to Def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroudin' your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan
I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B and so I creep

[*gunshots*] OKAY, I'M RELOADED!
You motherfuckers, think you big time?
Fuckin with Jay-Z, you gon' die, big time!
Here come the "Pain"! [*gunshots*]

[Jay-Z]
Jigga... (Jigga), Bigga... (Bigga)
Nigga, how you figure... (how you figure)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyyo

Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us (uh-huh)
The number one question is can the Feds get us (uh-huh)
I got vendettas in dice games against ass betters (uh-huh)
and niggaz who pump wheels and drive Jettas
Take that witcha.

[Notorious B.I.G.]
. hit ya, back split ya
Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related
Most hate it.

[Jay-Z]
. can't fade it
While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him
What's ya name?

[Notorious B.I.G.]
. Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Tryin to push 700's, they ain't made them yet
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too
Niggaz 'round the way call me Igloo Stix (Who?)
Motherfucker!

[Chorus]
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers
(Where you from?) Brooklyn, goin out for all
Marcy - that's right - you don't stop
Bed-Stuy. you won't stop, nigga!

Yo, I'm makin' short term goals, when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to Free a big Willy
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly

Shoppin' sprees, copin' three
Deuce fever, IS's fully loaded, hehe, yes
Bouncin' in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like buddha
50 G's to the crap shooter, niggaz can't fade me

Chrome socks beamin' through my peripheral I see ya schemin'
Stop dreamin', I leave your body steamin'
Niggaz is fiendin', what's the meanin'?
I'm leanin' on any nigga intervenin'
With the sound of my money machine-in'

My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and runnin'
Y'all niggas don't want it, I got the Godfather flow
The Don Juan DeMarco, swear to God, don't get it fucked up

To give you a piece of my mind
'Cause you can't knock the hustle

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set
I'm feelin' it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I keep it realer than most I know your feelin' it
Cristal on ice I like those toes I keep spillin' it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes lookin' ill and shit

Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin' to live for like them lifers but
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher

We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up
I bout to hit these niggas that'll light they life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches

I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger lookin' gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talkin' 'bout large money what's the point?

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set

Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do?
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all n*ggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas
tryin to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
or taking pictures with some b*tches, in front of the drop
The streets is watching

*chorus*
When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

Man, it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
the streets is watching you, when you froze your arms

Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked, I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
Okay, I'm reloaded!

I did it again niggaz
Fucked up, right? I know
I know what y'all niggaz asking yourself
Is he gonna ever fall off?
No...

How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he slay the beef and slept with a tech?

"Marcy To Hollywood"
(feat. Memphis Bleek, Sauce Money)

...back again & back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again

As a youth I used to hold the weed up
old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader
in order to succeed I had to slow my speed up
didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the chieva
they said believe us or not trust is somethin' you earn
with every mistake you make back to us you return
probably would go Hollywood I thought he was jokin'
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smokin'
All engulfed into honeys the pussy was tight
if she threw the pussy right I got mushy like
Damn baby I love you take all my cash
"You ain't got to lie Jay," you already gettin' the ass
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on
soon as I got soft it turned her off
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissin' my friends
& that's when the ceiling fell in

I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again

I came through with the shines
like the streets was blind
didn't master my Algebra no caliber
Stick me? I was thinkin' how & for what
but reality bites like a thousand mutts
Nothin' worse than the person that's foul with guts

No amount of money can change me

Check, live from the 7-1-8
Either respect the flow or learn your lesson from your weight
I'm wishin' arthritis on all writers who, knock my hustle
How can y'all understand the struggle?
It's hard to live, when you got greedy niggaz in the mix
Knowin' I outclass three-E niggaz in the six

So I outblast till it's empty clips
And I outlast niggaz, survival of the fit
One life, I gotta make sure it's done right
'Cause them yet to have a conversation
'Bout reincarnation ball out, until I fall out
Stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out

Hard to think about your future with, nothin' to gain
Hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain
Life's harsh, I know y'all runnin' from 'caine

Verse 1: Jay-Z
Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club

Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through

I ride throught the ghetto windows down halfway
Halfway out of my mind music on 9, blasting Donny Hathaway
Me and my niggas spending half the day
Plotting, how we gon get this math with out getting balst away
I wake up to the same problems after today
Life is harsh, niggas gotta?
Right from the start they place me in the ghetto tender age of nine
I tend to mine and to surrender to crime
Wouldnt wish this on nobody like the end of like mine
Ever since i was quite young a nigga been in divine
Had to scratch for every plaque, rap aint even all it's cracked up to be
Niggas don't stack up to me
Had to hustle in a world of trouble
Trapped in, clostrophobic the only way out was rapping
America don't understand it, the demographics i tapped in
I'm the truest nigga to do this nigga and anything else is foolish
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down

Told y'all real high, when I come through
You can try if you want to, you can die if you want to
We hittin' whores on the floor, whole crew be wild
Bitch, 'Back that ass up' like Juvenile

When my peeps come to spend a dime a piece
You know Mac come through with a line of freaks
Every bitch on the hit be a 9 at least
We gettin' head on the floor, while you grindin' freaks

Whole squad get it down like this
Whole squad buyin' rounds of Cris
Whole squad got they crowns on wrist
Whole squad got a pound of twist
Whole squad got a pound to spit
In case a clown wanna flip

Mac never slip in a club, told y'all niggas 4/5th in a club
If a nigga wanna draw, then the blood, it can drip in the club

You had to see she keep calling me BIG
And my name is Jay-Z
She be all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch

Coming over your shit, got my feet up on you sofa, man
I mean a hostess for my open hand
You coming home to beer shifts and there be soda cans
I got your bitch in my Rover, man

I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'mma pimp her, it's over man
It's over man, it's over man

Oh, is that your bitch
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips

Is that your bitch?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs
Keep looking in his eyes

Oh, is that your bitch?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?

Is that your bitch?
Why she paging him?
Keep praising him?
'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch

Yo, yo, why you home alone, why she out with me?
Room 112, hotel balcony
How she say, Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all

You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter

Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids

Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear daddy Earl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful, bitch

Oh, is that your bitch
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips

Is that your bitch?
Why she all in his ride?

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right

Yeah, DJ Clue! AKA William, M. Holla with William H. Holla
The world's most infamous
The Holla family nigga, Roc-A-Fella Records, c'mon
Dynasty, New Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, stick to the script

We live money over bitches nigga stick to the script
Remember where you heard it first stupid
Cop, flip, we re-up, get back to the shift
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script, DJ Clue

Yo, they call me William H., H, the all-time great, great
I fuck the most hoes out of New York State, state
I rock my jewels, jewels I'm not a fool, fool
In the small of my back I got this big-ass tool

When I'm skatin' through the city and I stop and kick it
Be the most asked question, how I got them digits?
I say I stay on my grind, never stop for bitches
Never talk like a mom, I gotta watch you snitches

And I stick to the script, that's my advice so life
Eat nigga, let it stick to your ribs
I seen niggaz go from handlin' birds to ramblin' words
To the man, seen a Sammy the Bull emerge on the stand

And it was all good just a week ago
We lost Todd E., but we still eatin' though
For like a hundred weeks nigga, we gon' run the streets
'Til we reach Malik or the date of E's release

Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we workin huh? Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin

Yeah, I get it down - anxiously the public can't wait
Niggaz had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
that what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin with toast
I ain't tryin to collide with folk,
but I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke
I guess you niggaz just woke - good morning!

You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me. what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

I see how you comin at me now, I'm cool

I'm not the snitch I don't go to the cops to get rich

You fuck around not have the right speakers in your system

Big thangs, thick chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four-dot-six Range
Shit mayn, switch lanes
Every town I hit you switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine
I givin 'em whiplash when I'm whippin the whip fast
Which one? Pick one nigga, I got a six stashed
Continental T's, no tense like I got a thick stab
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny
Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage
Just mackin this gorgeous; sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es
When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous
Standin in the Azure with white Air Forces
You can catch me in the parkin lot

What's the problem shorty?
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
but I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla

You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small
Shit I watched you mature - nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin a guy
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me
{You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know}
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be

Leave niggas confused from the day to the night
At night, see the light, when the pistol's sparkin
Daytime it gets dark when that pistol barkin

Damn how am I gonna say this shit, hey

I remember being kicked out the house, 'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook just like you
The niggaz in the hood was shook where the just like you
'Cause all they said was little whitey look, I'm just like you

But dog I can't see it at all, shit, we never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit, how to fight, ride a bike, fix the flat
None of that sorts of shit, nigga you was an abusive pops
Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach news to box, gotta teach news to block

And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach news to block
It's about time we have a father to son nigga sit down
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters, nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
Never follow your orders

Nigga you make me sick, pussy you could, ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin' my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out
The reason why I hit the block

Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hittin' shots
Reason why I started gettin' licked

just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy
high stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
shopping sprees, coping three, deuce fever I guess its fully loaded,
ah yes,
bouncing in the lex luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 g's to the crap shooter,
niggas can't fade me
chrome socks beaming, through my peripheral I see ya scheming
stop dreamin', I leave ya body steaming
niggas is feening, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening with the sound of my money machine-in
my cuff running over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it
six digits and running,

I got the godfather flow, the don Juan Demarco
swear to god, don't get it fucked up

taking out this time
to give you a piece of my mind
(cause you can't knock the hustle)
but though you think you are
baby one day you'll be a star

bouncing on the highway switching 4 lanes

Spill 3 quarts of my blood into the street
Let alone the heat
Fuck em, they hate a nigga loving this life
In all possible ways, just know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital dazed, reflecting when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back

And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine to five is how to survive, I ain't trying to survive
I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills, poison my body
I used to say 'fuck mic skills,' and never prayed to God, I prayed to
Gotti
That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, endz

Are half closed I put the key in

Pulled off slow hopin' my people fleein'

This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib at a sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner

Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets

To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready
...

Come on... life... death... here... gone... Yo

If I should die don't cry my niggas
just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
get on my niggas when it's real
say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die *echoes*

Don't cry my niggas it's been one hell of a ride my niggas
in the middle of the trial I flip pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas
I've eluded the coppers got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Ceasar Picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
rocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail
rhymes still written well hold court in the street
never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
everybody around us become one for that day
to live life get your shit right & play
Don't get it twisted like braids if I miss that's ok
but life's short don't miss a day uhh

If I should die don't cry my niggas
just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
and when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
get on my niggas when it's real
say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die...

...don't cry my niggas
it's been one hell of a ride my niggas
say word to Wais my niggas
when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
just keep gettin' it on my niggas
say word is bond my niggas

I got a lot to look back on in '88
got my crack on ten years later gettin' my rap on
gettin' shorties like a thespian
had an episode with two lesbians got a fetish for that
drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks & pulled the root out

Only wife of mines is a life of crime
And since life's a bitch in mini skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death

That's life's a nigga, long as life prevent us
We gonna sin a lot and pray to Christ, forgive us
Fuck it, ice the wrists and raise the price on these niggaz

Verse 1: Jay-Z
Growin up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said, "The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on."
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggas is 2-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
It's on

Chorus: Too $hort, Jay-Z
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago

(Jay-Z) I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

(Jay-Z)
It seems, I'm like Keenan, pickin' up on the vibe
that he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividin' the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matchin' the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
cause the last time they seen me hoppin' out the coupe
I hopped out in a suit

(Memphis Bleek)
Look at this nigga Jay frontin' tryin' to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin' like an ounce, more than I used to puff
Takin' advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinkin', "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
while he drive around town in brand new coupes and stuff"
Swear to God, they had me practically hatin' his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga whattup?"

Memphis Bleek

I done came up (uhh) put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?) no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Call my whole team from around the way down this bitch
I'm tryin' to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six

Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's O.K. round this bitch
I gotta talk to the natives, let 'em know I'm here
For all to get the pay days, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya
If so, jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya, that's right!

Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog

Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
with no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola? bid?
And walk the streets up in? like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
when I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
and kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

(Beanie Sigel)
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct

Verse One: Jay-Z


As a young and dumb man, gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with baste
Couldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
I needed something to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin nothin to waste
Life is like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place
Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winin, 'til the earth stop spinnin
Rock hot lenin, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not remembering,
My motto is simply I will not lose, abide by the block rules,
I buy my glock used, wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood,
If you ain't live like I live then run with the hood
I done what i could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature, if hell awaits ya?
Nigga I'm coming with the razors, still flashin ya shit
Try to pass me in a six, tight classy on the wrist
Every bit of 30 karats, this is not a game
This isn't why I came, make these words find a spot on your brain
And burn, then I recycle my life

Uh uh
So so def
Yeah, yeah

With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double are flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside

Tryin' to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I the chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it

Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up

Multi till I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and Jay-Z got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double r flashin' the rings
