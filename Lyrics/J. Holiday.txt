Girl why the hell you turn your ringer off? I'm just asking.
Since when did you start wearing all that make-up?
Tell me where the hell you going in them heels? Only supposed to be going to the market, I'm just asking.

Is she lying, is she lying, is it true?
Could it be I'm blaming her for what I do?
Can't ever have the thought of her fucking another nigga, but I guess it shouldn't matter.

She'll steal your heart before she moves on

She's got a heart of stone
Man that girl, she's so cold
So don't get caught up

I tasted danger
When I tasted her lips
She shut me down with no effort
She poisoned me with a single kiss

She might not know how to love
But she knows how to make it
And she might give you all her body
But her heart ain't for takin

Cus she ain't lookin for compatible
Cus she don't wanna be your friend

And what if you played it cool and just passed me by?
In years in fading unpredicted your thing baby
Your love is now the only song that I sing baby

Girl every time I look into your eyes it's like I see the morning sunrise
And when I see the smile upon yo face it's like I got a glimpse of paradise
I love playing with your hair, and grabbing everywhere
I'm kissing you all through the night

Don't choke on that, homeboy, blow it out
Don't sip on that drink, pour a little out
Let your life reflect what comes outta your mouth
And never pull out your piece unless you dumpin' out

Never fear no man but know when to run
Leave no man standin' till the battle is won
And when it's gettin' real good, better pull it out
When niggas front, don't give up, my brother, sweat it out

And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if you know you can't fight
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a one percent chance that it might be another man's

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

Stop cuffin' that young girl, let her breathe

She was suppose to be another game to play
And I can't figure it out, I don't know how she did it
But she made me fall, fall, fall

How do you find yourself inside of love
With a girl that you met inside the club?

Standing
In the doorway
About to leave me for good this time
She's standing
Handing me my chain
And the keys and the bracelet
I got her for our two years
She said there's nothing left to do here
There's no more love
I'm leaving you here
And she turned away
And I see two years fall to the ground

I'm saying don't go
Cuz you make sleeping difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
And you make eating difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
It's almost impossible
Almost impossible to breathe
Don't go

Last night I thought to back when we was in the 'Lac
Listening to tracks on my back, have you seen her?
Then I told you I wanna get between ya

Baby I know you remember that Marvin Gaye
And some of that Jodeci
So baby come here and let me sing to you
While we're freakin' in between the sheets

Shorty can I sing to you? Baby bring it near
Let me whisper something in your ear
Shorty can I sing to you 'cause I know what you like?
Let me bring romance into your life

Sing it with me girl
La da da, la da da
La da da, la da da
La da da da da

Shorty can I ask you one more question?

We've flirted, I've heard it all before
You wanna show me now
I've sat and waited, filled my head up around with doubt

I didn't think that you come around and see it my way
But you build up all the courage now
Tonight you're the water and I'm ride your waves today

So shawty wait until the lights go out
There's no more talking and no more teasing, nothing but pleasing
Wait until the lights go out

Let's loose the power for about an hour, say oh
Shawty wait until the lights

To the feeling that I had when I first saw your face
I knew that it was you
Some time has passed and the feelings that I had before still are the same
'Cause you, never changed, nooo

Even though, I don't show it, girl
I just want you to know that
Even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better
I meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring
That I'ma love you forever
I fall for you deeper everyday
And I'm feeling it now, girl more than ever
But with our type of love, forever ain't enough

I know people change but I hate we've changed.
And its killing me trying to figure out where we are.
Cause it aint the same, girl I'll take the blame.
And I'm willing to take this chance that you feel we've traveled too far.
Lord knows I wanna keep you, life without you I just can't see it.
But sometimes you gotta let love be what it's gonna be.
(Ooh oh)

I'ma let you fly and pray you come back to me cause I do believe.
If I let you fly then you fly back, then it was meant to be.
So fly, fly, fly, fly.

See there's this lady that lives on the street
She has no job, no home, no family
And she barely has the chance to even eat
So she begs and steals and sells her body

Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But if it was you, what would you do?
If you didn't have a home

If you didn't have a pot to piss in, didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless

Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you

But the governmeny ain't doin' a damn thing, and all we investing in is
Hydro and liquor stores SS 4 doors and 24's
But where I'm from thats what we live for, the ghetto so

If you're livin in the ghetto and your feelin me
Let me hear you say OH, OH, OH
If you're sick and tired of the same thing
It's alright to say OH, OH, OH
Cuz you know the Po Po's the project and the old folk

Don't choke on that, homeboy, blow it out
Don't sip on that drink, pour a little out
Let your life reflect what comes outta your mouth
And never pull out your piece unless you dumpin' out

Never fear no man but know when to run
Leave no man standin' till the battle is won
And when it's gettin' real good, better pull it out
When niggas front, don't give up, my brother, sweat it out

And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if you know you can't fight
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a one percent chance that it might be another man's

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

Stop cuffin' that young girl, let her breathe

You be giving me the coldest shoulder
Cause you don't want your emotions taking over
Instead you talking about you Looking for a soldier

Are you trying say you don't see that in me
I know that were friends,
but taking it there wont mess it up
Please just trust in me

I didn't think that you come around and see it my way
But you build up all the courage now
Tonight you're the water and I'm ride your waves today

So shawty wait until the lights go out
There's no more talking and no more teasing, nothing but pleasing
Wait until the lights go out

Let's loose the power for about an hour, say oh
Shawty wait until the lights

Mmmmmm
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeaheyeah

Thinkin' back
To the feeling that I had when I first saw your face
I knew that it was you
Some time has passed and the feelings that I had before still are the same
'Cause you, never changed, nooo

Even though, I don't show it, girl
I just want you to know that
Even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better
I meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring
That I'ma love you forever
I fall for you deeper everyday
And I'm feeling it now, girl more than ever
But with our type of love, forever ain't enough

I've been searchin' my whole life

(Fly, fly, fly, fly Ooh)

I know people change but I hate we've changed.
And its killing me trying to figure out where we are.
Cause it aint the same, girl I'll take the blame.
And I'm willing to take this chance that you feel we've traveled too far.
Lord knows I wanna keep you, life without you I just can't see it.
But sometimes you gotta let love be what it's gonna be.
(Ooh oh)

I'ma let you fly and pray you come back to me cause I do believe.
If I let you fly then you fly back, then it was meant to be.
So fly, fly, fly, fly.

See there's this lady that lives on the street
She has no job, no home, no family
And she barely has the chance to even eat
So she begs and steals and sells her body

Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But if it was you, what would you do?
If you didn't have a home

If you didn't have a pot to piss in, didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless

Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you

You know I tried, you know I tried, yeah
You know I tried, you know I tried, yeah, yeah
You know I tried, yeah you know I rally tried baby
So listen, I tried

Oh girl what I don't understand is why you wanna trip so hard?
'Cause you know I got a good full time job
And when on the road making doe
You can get anything you want from me

But what you don't understand is
That you said you'd hold me down
But now you're running around town talking 'bout I ain't shit
But baby girl I did my best
