I miss you
And I wonder how you feel about me too
Do you miss the way we would play
And waste our time away
Suddenly, we're apart
And I can't see you every night
Though we'd fight I loved you so much
Now I can't feel your touch

Oh girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh love

In your arms
I was happy as a little boy could be

You want it, you need it
But you don't understand
And sometimes it hurt you
When things don't go as plan

Take your time to get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time to get it
But you can never give up

Take your time to get it
Oh, it hurts a little
Take your time to get it
I know you'll never give up

Don't ever surrender
You've got to take the chance
You've got to stay hungry
To be the best you can, oh baby

Take your time to get it
Ooh, baby

But you can never give up

Deep in the heart
Love has many ways
Of touching your emotions
Taking control of you
And even in thought
Love can make you change
There's no way of controlling love
When it's part of you

Well you could be a married man
With two kids and a good woman
And you could give your heart and soul
I swear it don't mean nothin'
'Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel

I'm telling you love
Boy, makes things happen
You never know where it's coming from
You never know who you're gonna love
I'm telling you love
Makes things happen
You never know what you're gonna do
When ever true love takes hold of you

There's never a time
'Cause love will let you know
Love appears at the worst
And even the best of times
Takes over your mind
Your heart is not your own
There's no way of controlling love
It controls your life

G-G-Giving you, giving you.
G-G-Giving you, giving you.
G-G-Giving you, giving you.
Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind and why you keep dissin' me,
Poor little me.
And why you have a change of heart to turn it all around
And then try to put it on me,
Poor little me.
But don't you know I can be a trip.
I can make things hard.
But baby, I believe that you still got a heart.
That's why I try to stop myself before I start,
'Cause I can make it tough.
I can make it rough, but I won't.
Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt.
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Oooh, oooooooooh.
Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me,
Poor little me,
When you knew all the time that you could've been with your homegirl lovin' and a kissin' on me,
Sweet little me.
But don't you know if you wanna be a man,
You gotta work real hard.
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one,
Then nothing in the world should make us part.
'Cause we can make it work, if you take away the hurt from my heart.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
Baby, work it on, work it on out.

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
Don't put your love life in the streets

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
You better take it from me

Friends, who needs 'em?
One can't live with 'em, can't live without
Men, can't keep 'em
Not when your good friend is trying to bring you down
Down, down, down

Do you get suspicious when they call you their girlfriend
And you don't know them very well?
Watch for the glances on the side to your boyfriend
Just read the signs, I'm sure you can tell

You see somebody standing in your own backyard
Somebody's trying to steal your man
Don't be a fool and let them get that far
You better stop them while you can
Hold on to your man

Hold, hold
Hold on to him
Hold on
Hold, hold

Trends, they feed 'em
They all jump on it, on whatever is hot
But girlfriends be careful
Because your man might be just what they ain't got, no

You should be cautious if you've found you a good man
Don't put your love life in the streets
There is a shortage of good love from a good man
So watch your back, you better take it from me

You see somebody standing in your own backyard

And I'll love ya always

Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert me
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert me
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

I, wish I had known that you were come for me
I was a soul that was lost and incomplete
You were my friend, and now you're my man
And I want you always

I, I just don't know what came over me, boy
You touched my soul and let me feel free
Always be there, and baby don't be scared
'Cause I'll love ya always

G-G-Giving you, giving you.
G-G-Giving you, giving you.
G-G-Giving you, giving you.
Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind and why you keep dissin' me,
Poor little me.
And why you have a change of heart to turn it all around
And then try to put it on me,
Poor little me.
But don't you know I can be a trip.
I can make things hard.
But baby, I believe that you still got a heart.
That's why I try to stop myself before I start,
'Cause I can make it tough.
I can make it rough, but I won't.
Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt.
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Oooh, oooooooooh.
Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me,
Poor little me,
When you knew all the time that you could've been with your homegirl lovin' and a kissin' on me,
Sweet little me.
But don't you know if you wanna be a man,
You gotta work real hard.
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one,
Then nothing in the world should make us part.
'Cause we can make it work, if you take away the hurt from my heart.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
Baby, work it on, work it on out.

I miss you
And I wonder how you feel about me too
Do you miss the way we would play
And waste our time away
Suddenly, we're apart
And I can't see you every night
Though we'd fight I loved you so much
Now I can't feel your touch

Oh girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh love

In your arms
I was happy as a little boy could be

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
Don't put your love life in the streets

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
You better take it from me

Friends, who needs 'em?
One can't live with 'em, can't live without
Men, can't keep 'em
Not when your good friend is trying to bring you down
Down, down, down

Do you get suspicious when they call you their girlfriend
And you don't know them very well?
Watch for the glances on the side to your boyfriend
Just read the signs, I'm sure you can tell

You see somebody standing in your own backyard
Somebody's trying to steal your man
Don't be a fool and let them get that far
You better stop them while you can
Hold on to your man

Hold, hold
Hold on to him
Hold on
Hold, hold

Trends, they feed 'em
They all jump on it, on whatever is hot
But girlfriends be careful
Because your man might be just what they ain't got, no

You should be cautious if you've found you a good man
Don't put your love life in the streets
There is a shortage of good love from a good man
So watch your back, you better take it from me

You see somebody standing in your own backyard

Do you wanna ride?

Baby let me tell you, I've been watching you
See you dancing in my dreams
Feel you heartbeat inside of me
So if you feel it coming on catch me getting in the mood

Boy I'll give you anything
Cruising's all you have to do

Do you wanna ride in my Mercedes boy?
Tell me what you're gonna do with me
'Cause if you wanna ride in my Mercedes boy
There are so many things that I'm gonna do to you

Baby let me tell you I've been wanting you
Always on the scene
Good looks and more possessing all of me
So when it starts to coming on catch me getting in the mood

Actually the way that we met
Never thought we could be together
It started off slow each day wanting more
Now time's finally took it's toll

Give me your love
Something that you give plenty of
Give me your love

Give me your love
Something that you give plenty of
Give me your love

Wished to get your heart
Touch the loving part
Give you what you've been wanting for

Now that you're gone
Been crying all night long
I miss the special moments we've shared

You're so quiet and yet you're [Incomprehensible]
Everything I wanted you to say

You want it, you need it
But you don't understand
And sometimes it hurt you
When things don't go as plan

Take your time to get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time to get it
But you can never give up

Take your time to get it
Oh, it hurts a little
Take your time to get it
I know you'll never give up

Don't ever surrender
You've got to take the chance
You've got to stay hungry
To be the best you can, oh baby

Take your time to get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time to get it
But you can never give up

A feeling in my heart
has taken over me, completely
and boy you are the star, to come into my life
you can take me
of all the guys i've ever known
they've never been as wonderful
so special and so sweet to me
and all the dreams i've ever dreamed
no one has been as good to me
hey you're the one to answer my dreams
: chorus:
why do i believe that i belong to you
how can i explain the symphony

My angel
You were like an angel
And I think that all should know, that...
That you're now an angel

Now that you're living with our Lord
You were everything that I know to be right
You were a guiding light
With the time that you had

Never will we forget you
You brought us so much joy
Into all our lives, and you
Showed us how to love

We had each other then
Wish you'd shared your pain
Maybe you'd still be here
We never knew your fears
Wish you'd let us in
Maybe then, you'd still be here, cause...

To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

Girl, make a list
Go out and find yourself a new bad thing
Girl, you need a trip
'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain
Just remember how he would tell you lies
And then pretend that everything is so sweet
Why should you sacrifice
If you're not satisfied
He's just a canine runnin' 'round in heat

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh
Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh

Girl, you must resist
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart
No, girl, I must insist
You've got to stop the fool before he starts
Just remember how he was so untrue
With all the tacky things he did to you
