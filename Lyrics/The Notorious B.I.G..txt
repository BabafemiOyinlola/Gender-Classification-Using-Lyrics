Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to
make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach

Uh uh, check it out, uh, Junior Mafia uh

I like this, yeah, uh, yeah, 94

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' moet, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the chronic by the tree
I love it when you call me big poppa

Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa

Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who

Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (ehehehe)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3

Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggaz frontin ain't sayin nuttin (nope)
So I just speak my piece, (c'mon) keep my peace

Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways

However I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks

Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it

Conversate, sex on the first date I state "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually"
Then I, whip it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South, aoowww
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans skirt butt-naked it all work

Gotta love ma little nasty girl

Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift

So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean

Mess around and go blind, didn't see shit

Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby I drop

No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst

Uhh, check it out, uhh
I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay-bee!
Fuck all that pretty shit
Takin it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggaz know the deal
Niggaz know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop? Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but seperately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us

was like who's gone who's gone who who rules the
The nigga kingdom and shit, basically
you know what I am saying shit
I was like this is like a fuckin election
It is an election...
You know what I'm sayin
Me and Biggie situation is smaller than that
Me and Biggie situation is like

Metro... we got a black male shot...
tupac shakur was shot seven times

You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see, when there aint nothing insight
Why I am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die
I'm destroying them
I'm destroying them

Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin

I'm interrupted by a phone ring
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin' thing

"Hello, hello?
Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis?

Yo call back, I'm busy

Why don't cha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team

I seen a honey with a butt lookin' butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sittin' all thick, with the ruby red lipstick
That's the one I gotta get with

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin

Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake

Sick of mama screaming that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in a hooptie
Whispered in his ear "This is what we got to do, G"
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby-mama screaming "Your daughter 12 months"
Can't live life swinging rocks and smoking blunts

Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though

Lock your windows, close your doors

Huh, yeah

My man Inf left a tech and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G
You with me?

Motherfuckin' right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
And I'm stressed, yo, Biggie, let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the tech is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard

Yes, love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Webs on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore

Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one

Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie

Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker

Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

Packed up my tools for my raw power move

(You talking some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger

Your heartbeat soun like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Finish it, stop, when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three in the corner

Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school new school need to learn though

Burn slow like blunts with ya-yo
Peel more skins than Idaho potato

As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Oooh, Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey, Mary?
Them jeans, they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'ma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimping ain't easy, but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts, I bust 'em one by one
So what's the four one one, hun?

Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch

Oops!

I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin
Its a face that I seen before
My nigga sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?
He tells me c-rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
Cuz I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the uzi
Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fuck the pop
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man c-rock

Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die

You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien

Well, I'm fucking you tonight

But I still can't let you pass me

Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners
to all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all

You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance

We push the hottest V's, peel fast

Me and Biggie and the models be, shaking they saditty ass
And parotta be, somethin you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan'
Scope the spot out, see somethin nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin Ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that pay for hors d'ourves
and rack up frequent flier mileage

Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent you
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggas brainless

All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between

They eyes, like 'True Lies', kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit put bombs in yo' moms gas tank

Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out

Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six, buy the house on the beach

Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention

These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss, promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga
That breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us

Treat em like we beat em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you never knew what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible, fuck the nigga next to you

When I release, you loose teeth like lil' cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my cd twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, yo he nice, but that's on the low doe
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as ripple be
Til lil' cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from bk to new jeruz -- thinkin bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin

Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, My cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

Niggaz in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun testin', Coke measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot steers my Lear, yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all
I spit phrases that'll thrill you

Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass

Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting

Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in they drawers

Yeah, ninety-six, for my Nordstrom Ave n****z
My Fulton Street n****z, dangerous MC's

Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Ooh wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness

Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is, y'all n****z know the rules
I blast on n****z so my fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues

Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted

Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your s*** it, just ain't got that loud
Gold tooth shine like ta dow
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, frays raise your eyebrow

By now you figure, he talkin' bout that n****
But your weak-a** assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift

At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jokes turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches
Missed you by pinches, your talk is senseless

Actor needs chiropractor for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked your cheddar box
Dangerous you're not I gets down
Twist your body round and â€~round, upside down

C'mon, yo, throw your hands c'mon
B**** grab your tits c'mon
Let me know you in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon

We 'bout to get mo' rich, c'mon
Let's blow the club, c'mon
F*** the place up, c'mon

And make it swing all around, c'mon
Yo, make this money
Throw yo' loot on the ground, c'mon

Bounce in your whips, c'mon

Make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chicken hearts don't exist
Settin' up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle

The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory

The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand

Sucked all day, smokin' blunts, countin' cheese

Violate me, he get beat to death

Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float

She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin to hear it

Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he likes to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics

Tell that reporter to go pick up ten thousand from Dez
and go take about like twenty G's from Gino
Tell that muh'fucker get this nigga next door up out of here
Nigga be snorin all night I can't sleep (hehe)
Call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick
(Bad Boy Big, c'mon)
The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
but the nurses is lovin me
Sayin the best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast, and givin me a sponge bath
Niggaz say I died dead in the streets
Nigga I'm gettin high, gettin head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggaz, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips (that's right)
All the time, Big Poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes
[Puff Daddy]
NOTORIOUS!
C'mon. we are, we are
NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!
He is. he is.
NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!

However I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi

Navajos creep me in they tee pee
As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet
Stop it, if you think they gonna make a prophet
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.

In diamond necklasses, stretch Lexuses

I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre' duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can i bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like i was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is...

Chorus:
Bullshit ... And party, and... (x9)

Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes

Oh, what a feeling drivin' in my four by four
Girlies galore, BIG on the door
Chrome trimming with the smoke tint
Givin' chumps a hit as I count my mint

Stacks of doves, half my mans is C-note
All from sayin' rhymes that BIG wrote
Blunt, I take a toke but only if it's weeds
Skunk with no seeds, a sip of Hennessy

Pass to D or maybe movin' solo
Never with a skeezer by my side, that's a no, no
Tell me I ain't the flyest nigga that you ever saw
Live in action, guaranteed raw

Who's coming through? Y'all know who

Bed-Stuy Brooklyn where this rapper was originated
Your rhymes ain't shit, they must be constipated
Many awaited, the heavyset brother from Fulton Street
To drop a rhyme to a funky beat

Expellin' MC's as if I was at Sarah J

Want me to drop the drama kid? Yeah

My man 50 Gran' told me straight up and down, man
I ain't 'sposed to love no ho, know what I'm saying?

I tried to tell her 50, I got three rules in life
I'm not to be played with, played on or played out
I'ma drop it like dis

Lyin' in my bed, I'm lookin' at four walls
Echo in my head sayin' I got a lot of gall
Grippin' my cap, my pen in my teeth
Thinkin' what this ho said, she called me a thief

She said I stole her heart and didn't leave a trace
I told her I was sorry and she said get out my face
Walked out my door with my walkman and my pocket
Playin', "Love is a house" and thinkin' how she jocked it

When she had the key to open up my door
Adore that prince scam that got me on the floor
I know that she loves me, I couldn't ever fake it
I say go buy a pie, the girl would go bake it

Comin' where you rest at, surrender

Step inside the ring, you're the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty, like your pussy in December

Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact

To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest (uh-huh)

pass that weed I got to light one,

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us,
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us notorious, thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us,
You all niggas be scrambling gambling, up in restaurants with mandolins and violins,
We're just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin,
High off weed and lots of gin, so much smoke need oxygen,
Steadily countin' them benjamins, nigga you should to if you knew what this game would do to you,
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I've been through,
So called beef with you know who, fucked a few female stars or two,
Then a bluelight niggas knew like
Mike-shit not to be fuck with. Motherfucker better duck quick.

Throw your hands in the sky, nigga
I'm stickin' ice picks on the tip of ya dick
Give your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?
Am I hard hardcore, harder than a Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with the spliff
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized 'cause I love to see niggaz die
Brains all leakin' out on the street
And the pastor preachin', he was a good man
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singin' sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, 'bout six cross the pelvis
Ya fuck with the high guy, ya die
Yeah, the same motherfucker kickin', look up in the sky
I'm on some old neck shit
Suplex shit, hardcore sex shit, and Tec shit
Whatchu want, nigga?

But I would've loved to hear
A Big Pun and B.I.G. collabo
That shit would've been incredible

Aye you know what I'm sayin, it was just happen
We have our day, you know?
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?
We keep it, keep it, keep it going from there

Uhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD
Cryin, know my friends is lyin
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apoligies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

Nigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap

1970 Somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late,
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,
Untill I call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2: 19 was when my moma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck,
Im seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY!

I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, i knew that i was

Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and (oooh-wee)
I stay, dressed, to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past fo'
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home, tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O. (heyyy)
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryin to wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "But I don't usually" (let's go)
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (aooww)
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt

Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work

Gotta love my lil' nasty girl
Know I love my lil' nasty girl
I love my lil' nasty girl
All the ladies if you feel me grab your titties for B-I-G

All my women from around the world

Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggaz

Theres no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell me what's happening to me

The country bud got me chocking
I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smoking
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that Killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all up on the drug dealing
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Paying dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swinging from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain
I'm living in a house of pain

Is anybody listening and tell me can you see this darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin hard to breathe

Make my name taste like ass when you speak I
See me in the street your jewelry you can keep it
That'll be our little secret, see me, B that is, I that is, G whiz

Hope they know my nigga Gutter fuckin' kidnip kids
Fuck 'em in the ass, throw 'em over the bridge

Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out
Y'all got to go, all I make is one phone call
All y'all dissapear by tomorrow
All your guns is borrowed, I don't feel sorrow
Actually, your man passed the gat to me, now check this
What's beef? Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you, guaranteed to be an ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep

Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying

So don't you get suspicious

Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all

To all the people that lived above the

Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to
make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many

To up close and personal with Robin Leach

Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks

But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can i bring my gat?

The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Ohh, yeah

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore she be game for sure
Pimp so hard, a nigga drag his mink on the floor

Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied, till all my niggaz get it
See you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it

And Big be that nigga we be flyin' through your hood
And hood rats scopin' with they eyes on my goods
See we date 'em like we hate 'em, see 'em like we don't need 'em
Treat 'em like we meet 'em and never give up freedom

And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you, never knew, what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual and if she's flexible
Fuck the nigga next to you

Walked out my door with my walkman and my pocket

Verse one:

Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though

Yeah
Motherfuckers better know...
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
Huh, yeah

My man Inf left a tech and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G
You with me?

Motherfuckin' right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
And I'm stressed, yo, Biggie, let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the tech is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard

Yes, love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Webs on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore

Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one

Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie

Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker

Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars

But not that many

Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's

That's why my mom hates me

She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves

Four drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it

Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault

I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about leer jets and coupes
The way salt shoops and how they sell records like snoop
Oops!
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3: 52, who the hell is this?
I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin
Its a face that I seen before
My nigga sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?
He tells me c-rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
Cuz I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the uzi
Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fuck the pop
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man c-rock

Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid

Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die

Twist cabbage off instinct niggaz don't think shit stink

Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right, if they head right, Biggie there every night

Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
do something to us, talk go through us
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (ehehehe)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3
(Take that, take that, take that, haha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggaz frontin ain't sayin nuttin (nope)
So I just speak my piece, (c'mon) keep my peace

Packin, askin who want it, you got it nigga flaunt it

Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid (uh)

Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (hip to)

And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners
to all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all

You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance

And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan'
Scope the spot out, see somethin nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin Ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that pay for hors d'ourves
and rack up frequent flier mileage

Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent you
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggas brainless

All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between

They eyes, like 'True Lies', kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit put bombs in yo' moms gas tank

Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out

Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six, buy the house on the beach

Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention

These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss, promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga
That breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook we can both pull burners
Make the motherfuckin' beef cook

Picture a nigga hidin', my life in that man hands

Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I been through!

No aspirations to quit the game

Grab your Gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one

As I sit back relax
Steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex

I'd probably go to jail
For fuckin' Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
The jeans they fittin' like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'mma show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm takin' no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. wit telepathy
The recipe of picture hardcore wit a gun
Pimpin' aint easy but it Sure is fun
When I bust my nuts
I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun?

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to
make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' moet, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the chronic by the tree
I love it when you call me big poppa

Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies

Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in' a hooptie
Whispered in his ear "This is what we got to do, G"

Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good

Can't live life swinging rocks and smoking blunts

Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies

Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews

Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project

Yeah

(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Lock your windows, close your doors

Huh, yeah

My man Inf left a tech and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G
You with me?

Motherfuckin' right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
And I'm stressed, yo, Biggie, let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the tech is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard

Yes, love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Webs on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

One:

So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
that you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is
natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates
The funk baby

Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial

I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
the Q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die

As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big BAD motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold

What, you tryna tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up wit my girl and shit you fucked her eight times
You see her you don't say shit to her, ya know what I'm sayin'?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talkin' 'bout you
"Why the fuck Big don't want me?"

Yo Big, this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shana in the mall
And I know you ain't fuckin' her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that

Yeah muthafucka, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass
For like a fuckin' hour, I don't know what's goin' on
Muthafuckas tryna rob me, you be dissapearin' and shit
I'm waitin' in the cold, what the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fuckin' call, alright?

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga, the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit

Now I throw shields on the dick to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggaz know they hot like a twinkie filling
Playing the Villian prepare for this rap killing
Biggie smalls is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
"What you talking 'bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dyke's
Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fuckin Fortune like the wheel
I squeeze gets till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me you don't want to fuck with Biggie
Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin' where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you're the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty like your pussy in December

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to
make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach

Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle

I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell

People look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay

That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you

Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me

She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves

Four drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it

Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault

Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo

What took you so long to answer motherfucker?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tripped a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch But you know you love that ass, don't you?
Yeah, no question

Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's

Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the chronic by the tree

My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2: 19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream

Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream!

Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced

And when I see the semen I'm leavin'

Yeah...
Yeah...
(you ready motherfucker?)
(we gon' kill your ass)

As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper girl stripper the henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave g
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die

As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold

All you hoes, calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that mommy?

Hi Daddy, how you doin'?
This is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night, mmm
You acting like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all that
What, you tryna tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up wit my girl and shit you fucked her eight times
You see her you don't say shit to her, ya know what I'm sayin'?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talkin' 'bout you
"Why the fuck Big don't want me?"

Yo Big, this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shana in the mall
And I know you ain't fuckin' her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that

Yeah muthafucka, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass
For like a fuckin' hour, I don't know what's goin' on
Muthafuckas tryna rob me, you be dissapearin' and shit
I'm waitin' in the cold, what the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fuckin' call, alright?

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga, the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the EP along by James Todd

Now I throw shields on the dick to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggaz know they hot like a twinkie filling
Playing the Villian prepare for this rap killing
Biggie smalls is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
"What you talking 'bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dyke's
Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fuckin Fortune like the wheel
I squeeze gets till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me you don't want to fuck with Biggie
Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin' where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you're the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty like your pussy in December

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to
make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach

Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle

I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell

People look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay

That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you

Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me

She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves

Four drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it

Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault

Hmmm... yeah

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch But you know you love that ass, don't you?
Yeah, no question

Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes

Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's

Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the chronic by the tree

My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2: 19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream

Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up

Wanna get their little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote tecs and stuff to get'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leavin'
Bitches be schemin', I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my glock cocked
One hoe said, big, why you so hard on us?

No sleeping all day, no getting my dick licked
Hanging with the goodie-goodies lounging in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice

And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth

Even left all my motherfuckin hoes for ya
Niggaz think frankie pussy whipped, nigga picture that

Petiteness but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that, I'm fucking witchu
The bitch official doe, dick harder than a missile yo
Try to hit if she trippin dissapearin like arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a connivin stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'm a peel with her
Find a deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Television's, versacci heaven, when I'm up in em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush

Straight up weed, no angel dust, label us "Notorious"
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling

Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sitting here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I been through!
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two

Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game

Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your Gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do: fight or run?

Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga: die slowly
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me:
"Cash Rules Everything Around Me"
Shit... lyrically, niggas can't see me

Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself loving it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer, me or you?

With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine

Goin out to all the niggas that died in the struggle

See your family and that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away, I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're goin' through, oh yeah

Got my man a beat down to the third power

Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather

No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up

And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine

Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno:  never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2:  never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness

How's everybody doin' tonite?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
he came out wit the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Haha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B.I.G. *clapping*
The Notorious B.I.G. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him ya'll
Uhhh

A nigga never been as broke as me, (I like that)
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, (besides that)
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
and alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga with the fake- blaow!
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
and hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gear - Oshkosh with blue and white dunks
Pass the blunt
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on

Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, pressin what you want

The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I know
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just trying to be all I can be

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore, she be game for sure
Pimp so hard a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me, that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it
See, you hit it then I hit it. We get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga, we be flying through your hood
And hood rats scoping with their eyes on my goods
See, we date em like we hate em, see em like we don't need em
Treat em like we beat em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you never knew what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible, fuck the nigga next to you

"When the Remy's in the system, ain't no telling
Will I fuck him? Will I diss him?" That's what these hoes yelling
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase em, I'll replace em

Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as ripple be
Til lil' cease crippled me

Move from bk to new jeruz -- thinkin bout

Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous

You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, My cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

Strictly gun testin', Coke measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito

Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot steers my Lear, yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin'

Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift

At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jokes turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches
Missed you by pinches, your talk is senseless

Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary

Uhh. uhh. uhh. (yo c'mon Big) uhh.
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
the prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high
Yo. yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here

To my motherfuckin' man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate Thai smoker hear

I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl butt cheeks I'm smackin' her
The raw rapper, spine snapper with the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah

A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin' comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin' her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her

Why you wanna play your games on me, bitch, you crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggaz on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics are drastic

Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigree you better be, filled with energy
Niggaz never gettin' me, so let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down

Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man

Come and run with me . I really wanna show you

Hi I'm Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mom
I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he likes to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics

So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
that you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is
natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates
The funk baby

In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich

Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to

And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach

First things first:  I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get nathan
But penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like Island Carpet

Stop it, if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, gon' see my guns, get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell is stopping ya
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I'm in game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back, I get

What's under that skirt?

Who fillin 'em with octane? Got 'em gassed up
'Bout to get blast up, son
The last one, word to your mother, brother, listen
I've seen it when they kissed 'em at the wake
Made his body shake, the high guy in 850i's smoke tint
Rap terror, full chromed Anteras
True fly by the rivers but this is conspicuous
Bad Boys slipped in ninety-five ridiculous
My rap rhymes is like land mines
One step, ka-boom, black suits fill the room
To whom it may concern, Junior Mafia's the click
Act up, I'll have my honeys Total bust your shit
In the middle of the day now baby
I seem to think of only you
Never thinking for a moment baby

Uhh, uhh

Hah, what, I like this
Uhh, uhh, I like this
What? Uhh, what?
Uhh

Verse One: Jay-Z

We push the hottest V's, peel fast
through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be, shaking they saditty ass
And parotta be, somethin you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan'
Scope the spot out, see somethin nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin Ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that pay for hors d'ourves
and rack up frequent flier mileage

Chorus: Angela Winbush

Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know

We got Da Brat in the house and me
Y'all know who I be, check it
I got that shit all you niggas just love to ride to
Funk for your trunk is what I provide you
So slide through your hood with me in your deck
Cause your correct way to get your groove on flomps
And I paid the costs to be the boss as a kid
Fucked around and made some shit you can't fuck with
They thought luck did it but it didn't 'cause I'm back again
Back with the B.I.G. and my new-found friend
Sliding in from the front, never way behind
Niggas wonder how I came with this style of mine
Remain in your seats as I release the clip into yo' hip
Brat and Biggie Smalls
Aw shit, on top of all that, I'm so, so remarkable
Flow to make you motherfuckers know
Ain't an MC coming close to touch
Bitches I like to fuck, guns I like to bust, so

Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related
Most hate it.

While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him
What's ya name?

Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Tryin to push 700's, they ain't made them yet
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too

Runnin' from the police (Yeah, I know what you mean)
No matter what I do, they got a nigga
Still runnin' from the police

I ain't got nuttin' on my mind, but gettin' in some trouble
Licking shots to they block, leavin' bloody blood puddles
For some ridah's delight, now we in a gunfight
I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight
It's on me, but if I die, bury me a motherfucking G
A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
Thug Life motherfucker, got me runnin' from the police

Nigga, you know that's true
Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin' with a crew
Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re
The O.J. and it's all okay
To that fuckin' fake cop, got to play the man
Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand
Damn, I hope it don't spill
Nigga chill, shit is real, cock back my steel

Still runnin' from the police, I gets no sleep
I got you peepin' in my window, while I'm smokin' indo
But I ain't no motherfucking track star, pigs got a jeep
Like Big Malcolm, runnin' through motherfucker's backyards

Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales pullin' all the love
You don't believe in Harlem World nigga double up

We don't play around it's a bet lay it down
Nigga didn't know me ninety one bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no PHD niggaz hold me down, Cooter

Schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble stay low blow like Hootie
True pimp niggaz spend no dough on the booty
And then ya yell there go Mase there go your cutie

It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

I don't know what, they want from me
It's like the more money we come across

Yeah, yeah, ah, ah, from the C to the A to the D D Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly

Cop all the drops, I know you thinkin' now's when all the ballin' stops

Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest (uh-huh)

So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,
Untill I call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2: 19 was when my moma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck,
Im seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY!

All the blood spilling, is all up on the drug dealing
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Paying dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swinging from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain

Now it's gettin colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin hard to breathe

Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you, guaranteed to be an ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep

Akon and B. I.G. yeah

Niggaz talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Cristyle pop I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
Gator chunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the willyist of the Willie
Hitch link cop, M1's and 9-Milli's, stories like a motherfucker

Model bitch is wonderin' if I'ma fuck with her
She knows I treat my bitches like gavana
Dolce and Gabbana drippin', Big Poppa never slippin'
H-Class diamond, shinin', dinner with wifey whinin', dinin'

Smokin' cigars and Bogatar with Columbian nigga's
Named Panama and Enrique and shit, games we play, life endin'
Bitches bendin' over with ease for a pair of Moschino jeans

Donna Karan Tank-top I got your bank stock, say who's on top?
Benjamins under the rest of them, advancing from duplex to mansion
Stashin' keys, hidin' g's over seas, VCR's in my veins
Game elevates, money I make into stocks and real estate, bitch
Jet-skiing in the Caribbean, white sand, discussin' plans with my man

Dark blue land, smoke tint, chrome rims
And a system that leave my rear views trembling
Whatchu gonna do when poppa catch ya attitude
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my ring, it's a frank white thing
I stay potent, bitches devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

Eternal sunshine in this elevated world of mine
Lookin' for this hour glass of time
Tryna find my purpose on this grand design

Is there anybody out there living
4, 5, 6's on the streets they shootin'
Is there any money out there for me?
You just listen to this hustler's story

Picture me, a product of the zone three
Scareless, don't know what I am supposed to be
Shit 'cause, money never came to me
When shit shout, I suffered unshamelessly

First Verse (Missy Elliot)

Don't you know I'm the ultimate?
To get this milk, you be fortunate
Just like tasting pussy with pork in it

My steez is immaculate
My paper stacking, keep tracking, I'm macing, Ya'll slacking, Reaction, Make Ya'll dicks scream
I'm more gutter then golddiggers with figures, more bigger then jiggas, and even Paris Hiltons
Damn sir, Sniff me like a Coke

Cintamelia, All you wannah do is sniff me

Damn sir, Sniff me like a coke

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell

Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice

Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)

Uh Yea Baby Oooooooh, Listen To Me, OH Yeaaaa

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I f**k around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, didn't see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin "Aiy papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
F**k tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherf**ker with g ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to f**k her till her nose bleed

Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bently door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told u he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coup's up take the new Lame for a sec
12" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And Im goin out like Keyshia with the uzzi

They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it cause she running her mouth

She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

F**k around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted

Conversate, sex on the first date

Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (aooww)
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt

And when you yell, "there go Mase!" there go your cutie

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to
make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' moet, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the chronic by the tree
I love it when you call me big poppa

Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player

Calm as possible, make the deal go through

Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between

They eyes, like 'True Lies', kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit put bombs in yo' moms gas tank

Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out

Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six, buy the house on the beach

Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention

If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss, promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Picture me bein' scared of a nigga

Niggas bleed just like us

See who's this pagin me - and why
It's my nigga Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gamblin spot, and heard the intricate plot
of niggaz wanna stick me like flypaper neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggaz from the hill up in Brownsville?
That you rolled dice wit, smoked blunts, and got nice wit
Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah they're my niggaz nah love wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say dem, they schooled me to some niggaz
that you knew from back when, when you was clockin minor figures
Now they heard you blowin up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So - thank Fame for warnin me cause now I'm warnin you
I got the mac nigga tell me what you gonna do

Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my paper

Mad question askin', *** passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's

Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the *** by the tree

Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player

Feedin me breakfast, and givin me a sponge bath

Chillin, sittin on about half a million

All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)

Hoes I thought you know I'm smooth as a babies ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn born Teflon don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah ya'll a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in they drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you

Hope you got a rope to hang yourself

Fat like a Lexus coupe, I'll rip your troop

Yeah, ninety-six, for my Nordstrom Ave n****z
My Fulton Street n****z, dangerous MC's

Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Ooh wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness

Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is, y'all n****z know the rules
I blast on n****z so my fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues

Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted

Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your s*** it, just ain't got that loud
Gold tooth shine like ta dow
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, frays raise your eyebrow

By now you figure, he talkin' bout that n****
But your weak-a** assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift

At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jokes turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches
Missed you by pinches, your talk is senseless

Actor needs chiropractor for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked your cheddar box
Dangerous you're not I gets down
Twist your body round and â€~round, upside down

C'mon, yo, throw your hands c'mon
B**** grab your tits c'mon
Let me know you in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon

Thugs tote yo' s***
We 'bout to get mo' rich, c'mon
Let's blow the club, c'mon
F*** the place up, c'mon

Shake yo' nasty a**
And make it swing all around, c'mon
Yo, make this money
Throw yo' loot on the ground, c'mon

Bounce in your whips, c'mon
B**** lick yo' lips, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My n**** this be the s***, c'mon

Dangerous MC's
My n**** this be the s***, c'mon

Make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chicken hearts don't exist
Settin' up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle

The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory

The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand

Sucked all day, smokin' blunts, countin' cheese

And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand 'cause man
Come and run with me
I really wanna show you
How I run the streets
I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's
I really wanna show you
Come and run with me
I really wanna show you
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, "Who's next?"

Hi I'm Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mom
I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he likes to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics

Uh uh, check it out, uh, Junior Mafia uh
I like this, yeah, uh, yeah, 94

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' moet, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' ***, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', *** passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C notes by the layers, true da life players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the *** by the tree

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' fellas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a *** up in your waist please don't shoot up the place, why?

I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre' duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can i bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like i was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is...

Chorus:
Bullshit ... And party, and... (x9)

Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes

Even left all my motherfuckin hoes for ya

Petiteness but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that, I'm fucking witchu

Try to hit if she trippin dissapearin like arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a connivin stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'm a peel with her
Find a deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop? Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but seperately cause now I, charter my own

I seen a honey with a butt lookin' butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sittin' all thick, with the ruby red lipstick
That's the one I gotta get with

Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three

Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project

Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit

The first pocket that's fat the tech is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard

Yes, love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Webs on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter

Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie

Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker

Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches

Who the fuck is this?
Pagin me at 5: 46 in the mornin crack a dawnin
Now I'm yawnin, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin me and why.

Told me he was in the gamblin spot and heard the intricate plot

Yeah...
Yeah...
(you ready motherfucker?)
(we gon' kill your ass)

As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper girl stripper the henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave g
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die

As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold

All you hoes, calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that mommy?

Hi Daddy, how you doin'?
This is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night, mmm
You acting like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all that
What, you tryna tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up wit my girl and shit you fucked her eight times
You see her you don't say shit to her, ya know what I'm sayin'?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talkin' 'bout you
"Why the fuck Big don't want me?"

Yo Big, this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shana in the mall
And I know you ain't fuckin' her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that

Yeah muthafucka, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass
For like a fuckin' hour, I don't know what's goin' on
Muthafuckas tryna rob me, you be dissapearin' and shit
I'm waitin' in the cold, what the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fuckin' call, alright?

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga, the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the EP along by James Todd

One: Notorious, Meth

I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick
To stop me from that HIV shit
And niggaz know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playin the villian
Prepare for this rap killin
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
"What you talkin bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
is here to excite and
throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless
Guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fuckin Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me (T-H-O-D
Man) You don't want to fuck with Biggie

Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitchin, button up ya lip and

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to
make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good (It's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach

I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle

I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle

Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle

I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell

People look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay

That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you

Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me

She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves

Four drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it

Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault

Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo
Yo would you kill for me?
(Girl)
Hmmm... yeah
(Puff Daddy)
What took you so long to answer motherf*cker?
(Girl)
I don't know
(Puff Daddy)
The f*ck wrong with you b*tch?

Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's d*ck (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and sh*t, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my b*tch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy f*ckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.

Just me and my b*tch (variations repeat to next verse)

But you know you love that a$$, don't you?

Uh uh, check it out, uh, Junior Mafia uh

I like this, yeah, uh, yeah, 94

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' moet, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the chronic by the tree
I love it when you call me big poppa

Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa

No people pon gun men, seen? (big up, big up)
Comes on 94' where the African people and [?]
[?] on the corner
Watch this, lawd

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Nineteen-seventy something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2: 19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team:
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up

Now when I'm fuckin' those jen I'm invincible
Don't love no hoe, that's my priciple
'cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin' door
[you know] they might be the one to set me up
Wanna get their little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote tecs and stuff to get'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leavin'
Bitches be schemin', I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my glock cocked
One hoe said, big, why you so hard on us?

Live from bedford-stuyverson, the livest one

Gats I pull it, bastards duckin when big be buckin
Chickenheads be cluckin in my bathroom fuckin
It ain't nuttin, they know big be handlin
With the mac in the ac' door paneling
Bandaging mc's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, red boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my cluthes get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta, you see I smoke a lot

Hello, aw shit nigga, what the fuck time is it
Oh goddamn, nigga do you know what time it is
Aw shit, what the fuck is going on
You alright, nigga what the fuck is wrong with you

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense, going to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleeping all day, no getting my dick licked
Hanging with the goodie-goodies lounging in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
(You talking some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
