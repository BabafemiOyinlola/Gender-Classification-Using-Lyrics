Hey baby
You're driving me crazy
With that special loving feeling
That you give to me
And I'm so proud
You want me to be your lady
Now I know how it feels
To live a fantasy

I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more
'Cause I
I got more than I can stand
I found me a lover in another man
I got you baby
That's all I was waiting for

And I love
The way you love me
I place no one above
I don't want true love
I love
(And I love)
The way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the
I love the way you love

(Oh oh)
Me
(Oh oh
Oh oh)

Oh baby baby baby
I might as well face it
I've fallen in so deep
You have control of me
Without a doubt
It has to be the greatest
You're every bit the man
I had hoped you'd be

I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more
Oh no
'Cause when I think about your loving
Then I get a good beat
I get excited from the feeling
That it's giving to me
So won't you keep it coming baby
'Cause I love the joy you bring
I, I, I, I love

(And I love
The way you love me)

Happiness is when i, i think of you,
and we'll be gettin' together for a rendez-vous,
i'll be on time, you bring the wine,
and when we lock the door, you'll be all mine...
alone in my room, thoughts of you in my head as i wait...
the time is soon, you'll arrive, together then,
we'll escape into the night on wings of love,
and do the things that we onced dreamed of...
all aboard a luxury, a first class ticket to ecstasy...
It won't stop! it don't stop! a non-stop secret rendez-vous!
it won't stop! it don't stop! a non-stop secret rendez-vous!

Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has it's sugar and cream
Your eggs are over easy, your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me
Now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking 'bout me
We don't talk the way we used to talk, it's hurtin' so deep
I've got my pride, I will not cry
But it's makin' me weak

I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token of love from you to me, ooh, baby

I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me you're not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk
You like to think that I'm just crazy when I say that you've changed
I'm convinced I know the problem
You don't love me the same

Yesterday you told me that you love me
And you love me for good
You said that we'll get married
When the time was right and I understood

But how long were you planning
To deceive me?
Love me and then leave me
How long will you pull on with my love over my eyes?

Wish you had told me
You were a family man
'Cause if you had told me
I would have made other plans

It wasn't very long ago
You promised me that we'd go away
Told me to be patient, you say
Good things come to those who can wait

How long will you play with my emotions
Treat me like a token?
How long must you play your silly games

I used to think that love was so silly
Something that a girl like me never dreamed of
It never was for me, (no not really)
But there was not a guy who was special enough
Until you came and made me so happy
Like a child on Christmas Day
I was so, so, so, so anticipating
And I didn't know I could ever feel this way

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
You bring me joy, you bring me joy, you bring me joy

I used to think that love was a mischief
Something that a guy just could not figure out
As if I never had no fancy stuff
Not even a clue what true love was about
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring

We walked into the room
You tried to make your move much too soon
And then you cried the blues
Why don't you understand I won't date you

But I heard of the other night before
Boy I'm amazed that you could just ignore
How does a lady find the words to say it
Why can't you get it thru your head "I'm not that way"

I wasn't for it the very first time
Don't Mess with Me, Baby don't you mess with me
I didn't stutter, I didn't think twice
Baby Don't you Mess with Me
With your bad self, baby Don't Mess with Me

You took me for a ride
A fancy restaurant to wine and dine

Lately I've seen a change in you
Your touch is not the same
You close the door to all your emotions
I'm left out in the rain

You said that we should go our separate ways
Indecision leads your heart
I could never live in a world without you
And the pain inside is tearin' me apart
Tell me tomorrow
(Tell me tomorrow)
Don't you break my heart tonight, oh baby
(Tell me tomorrow)
Oh, let's just make believe
This love will never die
Maybe I was holdin' on too tight
I guess I should have known
When you leave, I won't put up a fight, no
If you have to go
Close your eyes, take me in your arms
Just the way it used to be, yeah
But before you turn and walk away

Burying bones on every corner
Better keep him on the leash

Never felt so good before
Never dreamed I would explore
Makin' love in the positions that you got me doin'
I never thought I'd beg for more
Never thought I'd find a man who can do it again and again
And then even do it like once again

I've never trembled in my life
Heard about it once or twice
But now I'm shakin'
And I swear the shakin' feel so nice

Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause I don't want to be away from you
You shouldn't have felt so good
Lord knows I've never felt so good
It's wonderful
Well, there's only one thing I need to know

Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of the night
Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of my life

Can I stay with you, babe
Through the end of all time
Oh, baby, please
Let me stay through the night

Never felt so weak before

Let's be romantic

Take me in your arms, caress me gently
Oh, I can't get enough, ooh
Thrill me, say the word, I will surrender
To your poetic charm, oh

'Cause when the night falls
I hear seductive voices sing
Romantic songs of love
Let's get intimate

Turn the lights down

Kiss me, I feel waves of steamy passion

we'll escape into the night on wings of love,
and do the things that we onced dreamed of...

Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has it's sugar and cream
Your eggs are over easy, your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me
Now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking 'bout me
We don't talk the way we used to talk, it's hurtin' so deep
I've got my pride, I will not cry
But it's makin' me weak

I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token of love from you to me, ooh, baby

I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me you're not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk
You like to think that I'm just crazy when I say that you've changed
I'm convinced I know the problem
You don't love me the same

I hope you'll find what you came from.
He'll be mine since tonight I'm looking, feeling fine
And I'm ready, won't you bagging up a door.

My level's whole in me
And this one condition you'll love me, you'll love me, we're making.

Let's do it right, we can pun it all night,
With some music in your line.

Fairless came up to one on watch,
Right what you see, boy,
When you stand up looking this hot
You see me, you see me leaving.
Up in the club so let's go rock,
Rock the night, oh.
Dropping it round, we make it pop.

I've got you mine, and you've been so unleashed,
I know what your body's calling for.
I'll be your candy girl, you and me along the days go.

Forever trapped in your world.

Mesmerized, forever trapped in your world.
Now request for company,
So I plea for affection,
Your affection, boy, it’s truly a blessing.

Sex, boy, I’m feeling, boy,
I’m hoping to whatever, boy,
Mind and body to enjoy,
You got me so weak.
Nothing cannot belong,

Boy, this is where you belong
You’ve got me so weak.

Are something you can’t deny.

Your actions and words don’t mean a thing
I feel the pain.

But I don’t cry all these tears and now I’m all alone
If this is for the best, then that’s what love’s about.
Nothing in the edge, telling me lies.
I thought that I can take no more, though my heart’s unbreakable.

Pick up the pieces to my heart.
Put it together, a brand new start.
Been through it all, learning through the pain,
And do it all, my heart remains

Unbreakable, unbreakable,
Unbreakable, my heart’s unbreakable.
Unbreakable, put your hands to my chest
Rip my heart right out my soul,
I’m unbreakable.

Help me, I'm drowning in sadness.

Take my hand, say I will, say I do.
'Cause my heart's yours forever.

In a world full of people,
You can lose sight of it all.

Can make you feel so small.

Shining through.

Something that a girl like me never dreamed of
And it all was for me, no, not really
But there was not a guy who was special enough
Until you came and made me so happy
Like a child on Christmas Day
I was so, so, so, so anticipating
And I didn't know I could ever feel this way
Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
Boy, you bring me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
I used to think that love was a mischief
Something that a guy just could not figure out
If I never had no fancy stuff
Not even a clue what true love was about
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring
