We are friends, we are brothers Always there lookin' out for each other In a world where so many dreams are broken apart But when the world tries to beat us We hang tough, ain't no way they'll defeat us You and I will always survive, together we're strong Heart to heart Any storm we can weather You and I we've become United forever  Two hearts that can beat as one There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome We're indestructible (indestructible) We've got the power of love So strong we can generate A wall of solid love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Going loco down in Acapulco If you stay too long Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco The magic down there is so strong Feel the pressure Your back's against the wall Love is gaining on you You're just about to fall If you're afraid to love Afraid to take a chance You better hide your feelings Get out while you can 'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco If you stay too long Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco The magic down there is so strong ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
