Didn't I say please don't ask me questions about my life My life's an open secret It's in the songs I write It's in the way I sing It's how I feel Let me break this down for you See if you can really understand me  Everybody wants to know about my style and where I'm from Born a beast set out for feast at early age when I was young Mary Jane... my claim to fame was all about me having fun And smoking in the sun  Money in my pockets while the woman came and they'd go Seven cars in my backyard cause that the way I loved to roll ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

She's a very kinky girl, The kind you don't take home to mother; She will never let your spirits down, Once you get her off the street.  She likes the boys in the band, She says that I'm her all time fav'rite; When I make my move to her room, It's the right time; she's never hard to please.

That girl is pretty kinky; The girl's a super freak; I'd really like to taste her ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
