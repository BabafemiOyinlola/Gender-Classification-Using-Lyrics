Welcome. U have just accessed the Akashic Records Genetic Information Division. This program is required 4 those wishing 2 obtain a marriage blessing from the kingdom. When U wish 2 begin this program, place your right hand on the scanner and tightly clench up your buttcheeks as U might feel a slight electrical shock. Please select the race history U desire. U have selected "African-American". This is your history:  First of all, the term "black and white" is a fallacy. It simply is another way of saying "this or that". Let's examine the term "this or that" in its ultimate form which is: "this" means the truth or "that" which is resistant 2 it.  When a minority realizes its similarities on a higher level not just "black", but "people of color", and higher still "indigenous", and even higher still, "from the tribe of", and yet higher: "The Rainbow Children". When this understanding comes, the so-called minority becomes a majority in the wink of an eye. This action will cause a reaction or resistance. The source of this resistance must be banished as it is in direct conflict with the initial action. It cannot be assimilated, 4 its very nature is resistance. In other words, one cannot serve 2 masters. U are either "this" or "that which is not this".  End of part one. 2 continue, select the program "Family Name" and type in the current government name U wish history on.
