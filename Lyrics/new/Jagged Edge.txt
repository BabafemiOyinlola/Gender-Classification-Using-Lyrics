Muhtemelen aranızda pes ettiğimi sananlar var Ne dediğimi unuttunuz benim eski zamanlarda Yarım kalan bir şey vardı oyuna geri döndüm Benim olanı almak için 2 yüzlü salaklardan Jag hala sokaklarda ve bu kez bitti moruk Artık sikimde değil ya sevin ya siktir olun! Onu almaya gidiyorum olucaksa şimdi olur Yeryüzünde var olan tüm kuralları çiğniyorum Şimdi söyleyin bana hala sorunlu muyum? Siktimin geleceği için çalışma zorunluluğu Şimdi Jag somurtup uyur ama ben sadece. Hayatımı yaşamak istiyorum sikiyim sorumluluğu! Bana nasihat vermeyin bırak yaşayıp öğreneyim Çünkü herşey geride kalır ama başarı öyle değil Başarı seni kalıcı kılar bu yüzdende söylediğim... Tek bişi var yıllardır; bunu başarıp ölmeliyim!
