When we met, I always knew
I would feel the magic for you
On my mind constantly
In my arms is where you should be

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you in my life for all time

I'm caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
Aaahhhhhhh.

We stand side by side

Ain't there something I can give you
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
...

With all my heart I love you, baby
Stay with me and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave, 'cause I believe
I'm in love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name, I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way
your heart has called me closer to you
I will be all that you need

Hmm...

What have you done to me
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
'Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today
But now I wanna walk through your door

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, ho, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold
Just love me body and soul

"Buy Anita Baker's CD
Just Because
Anita Baker
(Micheal O'Hara, Sami McKinney Alex Brown)

When I think about how much I'm loving you
No limitations, no set of regimented rules
I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life
And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice

This must be, sweet fatal attraction
My life-long date with destiny
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'

Rhythm Of Love

Dialogue:
You know, this old worls just,
Keeps on spinning around and around and around
And sometimes it just spins too fast
And you, you not only lose you r balance
But you lose your rhythm and
It's at times like these that you just need to stop
And not only find your way again but find your own rhythm
Because life has a rhythm . . .
And mother nature has a rhythm . . .
And love . . . oh yes, love has a rhythm.

Can't cha come away, away tonight and talk to me
Far away from all the world's insanity.
Fill your heart with music tonight.
Satisfy your soul and ease your mind

Open your arms, close your eyes
...

If I lost you now
It would take my heart from me
I can't imagine life without you
The love of you, baby

Latley I confess
I've been short on tenderness
Too much time on work, I guess
Not enough on you

Now if I fogot to tell you I love you
I really got no excuse, no excuse

Because You're beautiful, my one desire
You're my soul's inspiration
And if I didn't say it, well I do now
You're my sweet inspiration-baby, baby

Lead Me Into Love 

We may never understand
If love just happens or it's planned
We must believe our spirits know somehow
Baby, we can't stop the falling we feel now (oooh)

New emotions overflow
And now this heartbeat wants control (oooh baby)
If the love was meant to be so strong
Something close to magic's coming on

Take my heart and lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love
I'm deep in the miracle of you (oooh)

Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

Dreams are dreams, some dreams come true
I found a real dream, baby, when I found you
You're so strong, but tender too

You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

Oh well, I think I need someone new
Oh, it just won't do, because I think about you baby

All I want to you is keep on loving you

I can remember stories, those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales, before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings, then tucked me in real tight
She turned my night light on, and kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions, of perfect paradise
She told me everything, she said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and, take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight
She never said that we would, curse, cry and scream and lie
She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise - of fairy tales - uh
No, uh - huh - mmm - mmm

Baby, don't hold this inside, relax your pride
Let it go, set it free, my baby, talk to me now

Say but the that I can offer is love true
Still I know you wonder why
This love of mine seems to die
As if I
Live in the clouds and you live in the sea

Now you can bet your bottom dollar
That I love you
Now for a basic fact like that
You'll need no clue

I just hope you think I'm good enough
I hope you think I'm girl enough
I hope you believe in chemistry for two

Soon you're gonna be gone

And I know I'm gonna miss you
My love I will send with you
'Cause I've been down too long
And you keep doin' me wrong

We once shared and I must have been blind
Just to think I'd find someone new
One who'd love me better than you

Well, it may come as a surprise
Loneliness has opened my eyes
I tried every love I could find
Still I can't get you out of my mind

'Cause there's no one in the world to hold me
No one in the world's gonna move me
No one in the world can love me
Like you do, baby

Every time I'm with someone
I'm loving you, yes, I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again

I look back on all those good times
We once shared and I must have been blind
Just to think I'd find someone new
One who'd love me better than you

Well, it may come as a surprise
Loneliness has opened my eyes
I tried every love I could find
Still I can't get you out of my mind

'Cause there's no one in the world to hold me
No one in the world's gonna move me
No one in the world can love me
Like you do, baby

Every time I'm with someone
I'm loving you, yes, I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again
...

Hmm...

What have you done to me
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
'Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today
But now I wanna walk through your door

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, ho, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold
Just love me body and soul

(Body and soul)

Ain't there something I can give you
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow

Changed all my plans, look what you've done
My house is small, and there's only room for one
I know this game darling ' I don't want to play
Why can't I just walk away
Who's got the time, I need my space
Maybe someday in another time and place
Who's got the time, I need my space
Maybe someday in another time and place
Just turn around, I don't need this, not right now
But I'm falling anyhow

How does it feel? And it feels so fine
How do you know? 'cause I feel something deep down inside

All the fun that came from those love games
Oh, well, I think I need someone new
No, it just won? t do and because I think about you, baby

From beginnin' to end, 365 days of the year
I want your same ole love, baby

You protect my heart, right from the start

Ain't no need in worrying
what the night is gonna bring,
it'll be all over in the morning.

There's a fear of night fall,
when darkeness comes and covers all the day.
Sometimes we feel pain,
but there are things that we can change, just pray.

Ain't no need to worry,
what the night is gonna bring,
it'll be all over in the morning.

Troubles come, but they do past,
heartaches, hurts, oh but, they don't last always.

Ah, many days it goes unspoken
But this desire never seems to go away
It's gonna take much more than hope to bring you close
I think I'll pray

I hear you say you've got a lot to give up
And there is so much more this heart of mine can take
If what you have to bring to me is positive
You send it right away, right away

I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life

Good love, good love
Good love, good love

There is a void that stands between us
And it seems it's getting harder to relate
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine
Life this way

"Buy Anita Baker's CD
Just Because
Anita Baker
(Micheal O'Hara, Sami McKinney Alex Brown)

When I think about how much I'm loving you
No limitations, no set of regimented rules
I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life
And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice

This must be, sweet fatal attraction
My life-long date with destiny
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'

Lead Me Into Love 

We may never understand
If love just happens or it's planned
We must believe our spirits know somehow
Baby, we can't stop the falling we feel now (oooh)

New emotions overflow
And now this heartbeat wants control (oooh baby)
If the love was meant to be so strong
Something close to magic's coming on

Take my heart and lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love
I'm deep in the miracle of you (oooh)

I can remember stories, those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales, before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings, then tucked me in real tight
She turned my night light on, and kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions, of perfect paradise
She told me everything, she said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and, take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight
She never said that we would, curse, cry and scream and lie
She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise - of fairy tales - uh
No, uh - huh - mmm - mmm

And I've held it in through October,

But I lost my nerve
Cause every time I saw you
Like a lovesick kid,

Things tend to slip my mind
Like how you like to wine and dine, babe
With romantic lights you mean a lot to me
In so many ways

Lately, have I told you you still mean the world to me?
Lately, have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well, tell me what you want babe

You know, this old worls just,
Keeps on spinning around and around and around
And sometimes it just spins too fast
And you, you not only lose you r balance
But you lose your rhythm and
It's at times like these that you just need to stop
And not only find your way again but find your own rhythm
Because life has a rhythm . . .
And mother nature has a rhythm . . .
And love . . . oh yes, love has a rhythm.

Can't cha come away, away tonight and talk to me
Far away from all the world's insanity.
Fill your heart with music tonight.
Satisfy your soul and ease your mind

Open your arms, close your eyes

For a little while we know what heartache is
And we feel the pain the world can sometimes bring
For a little while we cry in the night without a single song to sing
But one day all will change, there will be no more stormy rain
Then at last we will rest forever more

So if you're in the valley
 (If you're in the valley now)
And life is so unkind

And if your tears keep falling
 (If your tears keep falling)
From your tired eyes
 (From your eyes)

Your burden seem so heavy

I want you in my life for all time

I'm caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
Aaahhhhhhh.

We stand side by side

I won't be neglected
I won't be denied
The pleasure of your kisses
The pleasure of your smile

I think you take for granted
I'll always be here
Just because I love you
It doesn't mean I won't disappear

CHORUS
Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby
Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

Thoughts and mellow memories
Of once upon a time
Slowly creepin' on me
And they linger on my mind

Holding on to misty memories
Chasing shadows throught the night
Trying to find my happy ending

Reaching out for another chance at heaven
We could still find a way if we try

Baby, believe in the mystery

We were more than lonely drifters in the dark
I can remember the sun inside
Love held us tight
I need to feel your magic hear tonight

I look back on all those good times
We once shared and I must have been blind
Just to think I'd find someone new
One who'd love me better than you

Well, it may come as a surprise
Loneliness has opened my eyes
I tried every love I could find
Still I can't get you out of my mind

'Cause there's no one in the world to hold me
No one in the world's gonna move me
No one in the world can love me
Like you do, baby

Every time I'm with someone
I'm loving you, yes, I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again

Sometimes we feel pain,
but there are things that we can change, just pray.

Ain't no need to worry,

And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice...

This must be sweet fatal attraction, my life-long date with destiny;
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion I never knew was here in me...

I love you just because, (I love you) just because,
Just because I do - my darlin', you...
Emotions more than words can help me say;
I love you, (and I love you, and I love you) baby, just because you're you... (Just because you're you...)
Just because you're you...

You're a diamond in my mind, a treasure found;
A precious gem to me, you're so nice to have around...
I'm so glad I took the path that led to this,
And it's amazin' loving you, I'm doin' things I never thought I'd do...

Baby, we can't stop the falling we feel now (oooh)

New emotions overflow
And now this heartbeat wants control (oooh baby)
If the love was meant to be so strong
Something close to magic's coming on

Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love

I can remember stories, those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales, before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings, then tucked me in real tight
She turned my night light on, and kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions, of perfect paradise
She told me everything, she said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and, take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight
She never said that we would, curse, cry and scream and lie
She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise - of fairy tales - uh
No, uh - huh - mmm - mmm

You were with me, old friend, we gave in to sweet surrender
Now, I've held it in through October, November
No wonder, I never been the same since then

I picked up my phone, a million times to call you
But I lost my nerve, 'cause every time I saw you
Like a lovesick kid, child it was my paranoia
You'd laugh, but instead
You read these thoughts inside my head

And it's you
It's been you all the time
You're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute
But now that I'm in it

It's you, darlin'
It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on a light
Come on and watch me shine, boy

Now when you smile the world opens up for me
You're just my style and this time I do believe

Love has really no conception to this rule

And as a rule they were hard to take
All it took was the number of a fool

So many hearts break the same way too, aw baby

I will be all that you need

When we met, I always knew I would feel that magic for you;
On my mind constantly - In my arms is where you should be...

I love you here by me, baby - You let my love fly freely;
I want you in my life for all time...

I'm caught up in the rapture of love;
Nothing else can compare when I feel the magic of you...
I...

I look back on all those good times
We once shared and I must have been blind
Just to think I'd find someone new
One who'd love me better than you

Well, it may come as a surprise
Loneliness has opened my eyes
I tried every love I could find
Still I can't get you out of my mind

'Cause there's no one in the world to hold me
No one in the world's gonna move me
No one in the world can love me
Like you do, baby

Every time I'm with someone
I'm loving you, yes, I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again

Hmm...

What have you done to me
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
'Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today
But now I wanna walk through your door

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, ho, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold
Just love me body and soul

(Body and soul)

Ain't there something I can give you
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
