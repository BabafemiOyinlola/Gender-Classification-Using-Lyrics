Used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now?

Ooh, that's how much I care for you
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone

Ain't no cuisine my queen can't order

Niggas grab your lighters
Bitches grab your privates
We break night and take flight, I'm the pilot

It must be the Mo and ** mixed with Ty

Do we share the special thing called love?
I know I do, what about you?
I just can't get enough of your time

Where do I go, what do I do?
I can't live without your love
Thinking of you makes me feel

Girl, I want you be with you
No one else only you
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life

Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart

I don't wanna see, wanna see you leave
Wanna let you go, I just wanna find a way to work it out

We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
And I apologized tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think it's time to let this go

And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
And neither one of us wanna be the first to say, "Goodbye"

Listen to me

Last night I allmost cried when you told me
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gunna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that i've got for you
Im telling you

When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere

Lately I have been questioning if what we have is lost
I heard it in your voice when we were fighting
Tell me where it's gone?

Girl I thought that we could talk about whatever
Any problem that we had we'd always work it together
Did I say or is there something I've done wrong
Baby I should know, but I don't, still I wanna make it better

If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore

And work this out, work this out with me

Whats wrong with me
Why can't I do right
You promise me
You give me a life
If I could be
Well then just a typical
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do
The things that I say I wouldn't do
Keep doing the same
I give you
Might just too pitiful
To recognize your worth

Now you tell me that before
Promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants

There's somethin' one my mind about you and I that I gotta say oh baby

who'll never comprimise,
wanna see things thru my eyes.
which means it's my way

or is it you.
who's always shutting down,
never wanting to talk about,
the problems we got.

or is it we
to blame for all that's going down.
(we say that i love you but we can't work it out)
it's making us not want to stay around
we need to sit down and ask ourselves.

*Chorus*
Why can't we (Why can't we)
Why can't we get along.
when we know we can't be away from eachother for long
Why can't we
Why can't we get along.
when at the end of the day we know we gotta come home

Your hands full of cards parallel to mine
With your poker face on
Forcing me to draw four
I took, I took, three smarter steps
Seems as if I won this round
So I scream it connect four
But, you say I'm stringing you along

I don't wanna play this game of chess anymore
Cause everyone knows when your queen is gone you don't last long
So I keep myself in checkmate love

This is a dangerous game of love
Accusing you of cheating on us baby
Cheating on love baby
And I know that is so dangerous just because I do the same baby
Cheating on love baby

You may be the reason why I ever wanna be a star

Hoping that I meet you one day

Never wanna start with haters
never wanna get my weight up
You might be the reason why
You might be the reason why
Reason why I stay so fly
pull up for you everytime, time...
I pull up for you everytime
You're the reason why I get it

So the time has come, to pull back the covers

Her face, a perfect 10 in every way
with a body that's priceless and hair of gold
And my face would cvatch her eye in every way
She took a chance and let me be the one to know
oh the one to know
Her face went from blue straight to grey
She collapsed there in my arms, she passed away
oh, oh
And my face, confused and deep in faith
took a drink to let my sorrows pass away
Nowadays the sun it feels like rain
my only angel came and had to go

It was so musical, I first laid eyes on you
We both had things we needed to work through

There's no two people anywhere, more compatible than us

So we can be together, I'm in love with you

Never was a love before me, no one else compares to you
No one does the things you do to make me feel the way I do
Every time I see your pretty face it makes me love you more
All this time I've looked for love and now it is knocking at my door
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******

All the love you've given me is so special
Seems to be no limit, I'll do anything
There's no boundaries to how we can grow
How can I let you know, girl, let me sit and think, oh

Why does the wind blow? Why does the sun shine?
Why does the rain fall down on my face?
Why does the earth spin? Why do the waters reach the shore?
And tell me, tell me why, why do I love you like I do?

Oh, in the past, you were there when I was down
My friends could not be found, your touch kept me so strong
...

Alone at night
My body craves you
As i let the music play
And we make love in my mind
I feel the chills
As though your here with me
That's why i can't wait
Til you come home just to please me
That's why
If you want the sun
Then i'll shine it your way
And if you want your back rub
Then i'll come right away
And anything you want from me
Baby, you can have it your way
Ohhh... girl
This is your day
Its all your day
Baby, you know you make my day
When your with me

Try to style, fly up North with a homie

And there you'll always be
Baby don't go
Your love's so special
Can't let me go now
If I did wrong
I'm sorry
No other love
is for me

Catch me in the spot, low C's in the drop
About half and ounce, the size of Zip-lock
Knockin' the new One-one-deuce
I wanna (intro)deuce me and my old flame
And his name is Bruce
But blew my eye when his girl drove by
Told me bye then he winked his eye
I'm too Don fo' this, too fly to curse
Threw his jacket out first then BAM! Hit reverse

Oh, baby
You need to know
I've been in love
And I've never known love like this
I need to know
Just how you feel
Let me know if this love is real

Here we are all alone
You and me,

And we can do anything
Your fantasy
I wanna make your dreams come true
Can you hear?
She's calling me
Between your legs Loud and clear
I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

We can make love in the bedroom
floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair

Making love away beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere...
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet

On the patio we can make a night you won't forget

On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere...

I love the way your body feels
On top of mine so take your time
We got a night
Girl, you know I like it slow
And I know you like it too, baby
Please don't stop I feel it now

Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed

Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known

Listen baby

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me?
Whatcha gonna do without my love?
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you?

Whatcha gonna do without me?
And everything I used to do for you

But I never thought you'd let me down

I saw a letter lying on the floor
I couldn't help but look inside
Thought it was something that you must have left
Left there for me to find
All your words were on that page
All my dreams came true that day
I found your letter
Your letter

It said you love me
But you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew
That you could ever feel this way
It said you only wish someday
That I would feel the same
In your letter

I guess it just never occurred to me
That you would feel the way I did
You kept the sweetest secret from my heart

With your poker face on
Forcing me to draw four
I took, I took, three smarter steps
Seems as if I won this round
So I scream it connect four
But, you say I'm stringing you along

I don't wanna play this game of chess anymore
Cause everyone knows when your queen is gone you don't last long
So I keep myself in checkmate love

This is a dangerous game of love
Accusing you of cheating on us baby
Cheating on love baby
And I know that is so dangerous just because I do the same baby
Cheating on love baby

Yah
Oh Oh, Everyday
This is the real right here
Things aint always what they seem
Check it

People look at us
And say man they got it made
They signed a record deal
And now them boys is paid
But they don't know what comes along with it
With all the fame and the fortune there's still bull
Cause even though we struggled hard
And gave up everything just to make it this far
Some people love us, and
Other people hate us
But we gonna take the haters
Make them our motivators
Cause they don't
Know what we've been through
And none of them could ever
Walk a mile in our shoes
And I got to keep it real
Every record deal aint a good record deal
But I'm a grown man so I didn't cry about it
Kept my head up, stayed strong
Until I got up out that contract
And I reminisce on what my lawyer use to say
But I wanted it so bad
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Everyday
Yah

If it aint one damn thing it's another thing

If it aint one damn thing it's another thing

And get it off your chest

Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin' with a smile
Let me make you feel so right!

Wazzup ma, how you doin'?
24 in the waist; that's how you do it?
Rockin' them sell with the waistline low
The kind I like, that let the crack show
I ain't neva' did shit but rob a pocket for a ho
Between me and you, this shit's gettin' old
I could see me and you, in this grill,
Or ridin' shotgun while you whippin' the wheel

Come take a trip
With your boy Unk, I want what you want
Don't be talking about what you don't
Open that bottle; shots of patron
Let's get it on
Foreplay my way and she bumpin' my song
5 in the morn'
She holla' one more round before lickin' my cone

Y-E-S
I could take away your stress
I say Y-E-S

Oh babe, ah darlin'
Oh babe, babe, my, my, my sweet babe
Oh babe, babe, ah darlin'
Oh baby, my, my, my sweet babe

A man is important in a scheme of things
He's the king of his castle and the head of his household
And when you look at a man you expect him to be a leader
This world belongs to a man but there is someone else
That I can not leave out she's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt even though were living in

A man's world, to know that your living in a man's world
But it would be nothing without the touch from a woman
Though were living in a man's world
To know that your living in a man's world
But it would be nothing without the touch from a woman
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
