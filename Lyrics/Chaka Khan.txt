Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your kiss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody (Nobody)

A faded photograph I mailed to you
With feelings I don't want to face
And the long song of surrender in blue
I remember when you took my breath away, yeah

Chanson papillon, we were very young
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly
Chanson papillon, we had just begun
We let it slide on by, we didn't realize

All our memories are burning in time
Like a bittersweet perfume
Can you tell me how a love that's so fine
Could have climaxed in a single afternoon

For me to say I love you
It wouldn't be difficult
If you would say the same
And believe me when I tell you
That I know you very well
I know you like I know my name

I think that I have met you
Somewhere in my dreams
I may never have met you at all
And I know you must be thinking,
"What a silly girl"
I know your every thought and scheme

I wake up to the feeling each morning
I go to bed to it at night

Here is my hand for you to hold
Here's the part of me they have not sold

Call me foolhardy if you will
But i loved you when, do you love me still

So I walk a little too fast and I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely

A long time ago in the 40s
Dizzy and bird gave us this song
They called it a night in Tunisia
And the melody still lingers on

It was new and very strange
Blew the squares right off the stage
Few could play along
The, the melody still lingers on

Max and miles to name just two
Together they grew
The music was young and strong
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun
When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever Come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
...

All night and day
Just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work

As hard as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you

Can you hear me calling
Out your name
You know I'm falling
And I don't know what to say

And I can't get the words out

Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Wanna be with you everywhere

All is fair in love boy

Every time you go missing you so somethin' deep

But then you say the word then I go under

I'll take every little thing I do

Busy, I'm so busy
Climbing higher, moving further everyday
I gotta keep going, don't you know it?
I can't let sentimental feelings in the way

But there comes a time
When you want to share your heart
Give up everything
And just lose yourself in love

I'll take every little thing I do
Give it up, give it all up for you
I mean every little thing, it's true
Give it up, give it all up for you

Keep up with the Joneses
If they've got it then you need it right away

It's five a.m. when you walk in
This is where your story begins
You say you've been out with the fellas
But the perfume tells me where you've been

Well I knew for sure, when you walked through the door
You had another lover
I read the signs, but I tried to hide
All the pain I felt inside

You can make the story right
I believe what you say though you tell me lies

Big brown bedroom eyes
They're bad for me
Reluctantly you hit me
To my vulnerability

I don't like this feeling
'Cause I can't see straight
Something says I met my match
Courtesy of fate, alright

I've always taken pride
In my independence
So afraid and careful
Not to show it

No, but you give me clarity
Like a bright green laser beam
I think you want what's best for me

Lekin studio mein jaana meri majboori hai

Phir thoda t, then I take it easy

Well, well
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

I, I can't explain
How you got inside my system
But I feel the sweetest pain
I, I can't do that
But I've got to break this tension
If it makes you feel the same

An ordinary woman
That's all I am
And I think I'm fallin'
For an ordinary man

Take me to your heart
When the love begins
You and I can only try
To make a love with no strings

Take me to your heart
When the story ends
You and I, we can't deny

I'm too good to you, yeah
What the hell you take me for?
I'm nobody's fool

Boy, what is wrong with you?
I don't have time for this
You can't make me lose my mind
I'm too strong for ya'

Disrespectful
Yeah, it's no mystery
Best thing to happen to you
No one compares to me

Baby, I remember
When you use to love me
I remember when you used to love me
Through the good and bad
What a good thing we had

I remember when you used to love me
Why you so brand new?
What happened to you?

I remember when you used to love
Love me

Disrespectful
I don't think you're hearin' me
Better pay attention
I'm everything you need
Who's the one cookin' the food
Goin' through the same thing

Answers aren't clear
I thought we made a promise
Now you've disappeared
You seem to lead
Two lives at a time
Do I still fit in
I thought you were mine

Sitting at the bar
In our favorite café
I turn to see you laughing with her
And your smile fades away
Didn't suprise me
There's nothing left to say
I've got you red-handed now
And you can't walk away

You were caught in the act
When you thought I wasn't looking at you

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I used to think that I was happy
But I was just lying to myself
Made me believe no one would have me
So I put my poor heart on the shelf
Like a heatwave
Like a sud-den wind
Like a slap to the essence of my being
Boy you came in, like a sud-den wind
You know you blew me away
Away...
(Chorus)
Will you love me
Will you be-the-one
Who is coming, coming to my rescue
Will you care for me
Will you com-fort me
Will you be the one
The one who's gonna rescue me
I feel like I was born just for you
I am so glad you came in time
Now that your here

Yeah, it's no mystery
Best thing to happen to you

Through the good and bad
What a good thing we had

I remember when you used to love me
Why you so brand new?
What happened to you?

I remember when you used to love

Oh yeah

In France, skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
Soon she did the same

At home there are seventeen year old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun

Time

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Tellin' you somebody died

Sister killed her baby 'cause she could afford to feed it
They were sending rockets to the moon
September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June

You got to pay your dues

Me and the baby gonna miss you
I see your smile in her face

It's a lonely, lonely place

Would you walk away
Or would you have this dance with me

Slow dancin' (Slow dancin')

And you aim to win
And I wish you'd love me now
Like you did then
You're the best in the west
You're the best I've ever had
A naughty boy
And the memory of you fills me with joy
Let's do it again, let's do it again

Best in the west, when you were five
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Better than the best, oh you built your place
Lovin' is a symphony

There's someone I've found, so far he's true

Out of me there's a voice which keeps calling
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am

So medication still the devil in me

The feeling's up to you, up to you

So not to worry
Don't be afraid, not tonight
It's all the same, love
I'm in no hurry and
If we make love, it's alright

Alright (tonight)
Alright (tonight)

Bring back the day I met you
We knew it then, my love
You smiled goodbye, then told me
That your time was not your own
I see you five years later
Two thousand miles away
You left her for a mission

I'd never forget those nameless years
Street sounds whirling through my mind
Trouble was often in the air
So we thought to forget our despair

Cause I'm a street player
And I play you a song (play me a song, play me a song)

Will carry, carry on

City life's the only way
Street corners and billiard halls
Was my home away
Lesson's learned that still help me today

A brand new meaning
For whats goin on today
I felt it comin
Thought Id pass it on your way
In case your heads in the mighty fog
Theres a thought, a show in the dark, I say

Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on

Pass it on, a sure thing, baby

Good things coming

Clouds
Different shapes and sizes
Hiding the horizon

Clouds
In the distance
Coming to change my plans
All my dreams will melt like sand

Clouds
The moment that you say good-bye
They're gonna rush right to the sky

Whoa...

When you walked into my lonely life tonight
I saw my destiny, I saw eternity tonight
And the moment I held you I knew it
What we do is decided before we do it

Fate, this can only be
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in
Fate, now I understand
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman

Time stood still, and we were lost on words to say
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away
All we knew it was love we were feeling
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I'm in the mood to end these empty days
Ever when I, you stare down romancin'
Every time I see your face hopeless
Colder than ice with no more flame

I think our love has reached the part of no return
It's so sad when lovers don't see

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

That distant look is all you've got to say
Every time I try to talk to you

I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
Let me take you in my arms

I'll make it more than just a physical dream

All night and day
Just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work

Won't get the job done
As hard as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you

It's not difficult
For me to say I love you
It wouldn't be difficult
If you would say the same
And believe me when I tell you
That I know you very well
I know you like I know my name

I think that I have met you
Somewhere in my dreams
I may never have met you at all
And I know you must be thinking,
"What a silly girl"
I know your every thought and scheme

I wake up to the feeling each morning
I go to bed to it at night

I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun
When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever Come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

It moves my body
Yet frees my mind
There ain't no question
Ooh, it makes me high
If you're feelin' unsure

And this beat is mine (hello)

There ain't no question (I'm so happy)
Ooh, it makes me high

Captured effortlesly. That's the way it was.
Happened so naturely. I did not know it was love.
The next thing I felt was you. Holding me close
What was I gonna do. I let myself go.

And now we're flying through the stars.
Want this night will last for ever.

I've been waiting for you. It's been so long.
I knew just what I would do when I heard your song.
I fill my heart with your bliss. Gave me freedom.
You knew I could not resist. I needed someone.

And now we're flying through the stars.

(Back to me)

Lovers walk off on each other
Brothers go their separate ways
You wake up somewhere in the middle
Wondering why nobody stays
You are a child of wild desires
When your innocence leaves, yeah
Why you want to play with fire
Here I am
Here I am

Je m'appelle la Flamme
(Ça c'est mon nom)
Oh
Set off your alarm
(Oooh, ce soir)
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll take care of everything
Tonight

(What what what
What you gonna do for me)

You thought her love was too good
But she's the reason for your pain
But hey, I'm gonna make you happy

To pull out the happy feeling

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
An angel in my pocket, right?
Feels so right
This mirror's tellin' no lie
Gonna let this magic shine

Through smoke filled ayes
I begin my inspection
And I'm watchin' you
Your smooth syncopation
You synthesize
Your beatin' vibration
Makes me watchin' you

(And) If I smiled at you
Would you walk away
Or would you have this dance with me

Slow dancin' (Slow dancin')
Slow dancin' (Slow dancin')

Yeah, just you and me, baby, oh babe

Something about your freaky ways
Gives me a shiver
I watch you
You're a smooth operator
With sexy eyes, in anticipation

If I could only shake the hand of time
'Cause time has been good to us
Bringin' us closer together

I know our love is of a special kind
A real everlasting love
That keeps getting better and better

Night after night, night after night, day after day
The closer we get with every minute just tickin' away

Our love has come to see maturity
And from the very day we said hello
I washed our love for all

One million kisses later
Our love is so much greater
One million kisses after

What we do is decided before we do it

Fate, this can only be

Fate, now I understand
It's part of the plan

Time stood still, and we were lost on words to say
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away
All we knew it was love we were feeling
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning

Dizzy and bird gave us this song
They called it a night in Tunisia
And the melody still lingers on

The, the melody still lingers on

Max and miles to name just two
Together they grew
The music was young and strong

Got a need as deep as a canyon
I'm so glad I found my soul companion

I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours
'Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it

There's a message in the middle of the bottom
You see 'em, you love 'em, you got 'em
There's a proper time to pick 'em when they're fallen
Just listen, you'll hear 'em a callin'

There's a special way to know you got his lovin'
Can't you feel it, you ought to, you taught him
There's a special time for lovin' and another time
For huggin' and a lot of time to leave him alone

I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone

You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun

When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all

Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I think that I have met you
Somewhere in my dreams
I may never have met you at all
And I know you must be thinking,
"What a silly girl"
I know your every thought and scheme

I wake up to the feeling each morning
I go to bed to it at night

When you walked into my lonely life tonight
I saw my destiny, I saw eternity tonight
And the moment I held you I knew it
What we do is decided before we do it

Fate, this can only be
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in
Fate, now I understand
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman

Time stood still, and we were lost on words to say
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away
All we knew it was love we were feeling
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning

When I heard your song
It filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist

If I get a little praise, you say something to bring me down
And when I go it on my own, you'll remark that I'm neglecting you
There's too much to lose if I should stay around
Tonight and for the rest of my life, there won't be a compromise
To justify the lies
Now is the time(all the colors are faded)
Time to move on(and it's a story so jaded)

Maybe it's time that you step aside
This is my time and I'm feeling strong
Maybe it's time that you step aside
There's no use holding on
Maybe it's time that you step aside
I'm happy at last and I'm feeling high
Maybe it's time that you step aside

and I'm building walls inside me to keep the world from coming in.
I see no sense in taking anymore
I've been here more than all once before
I know the headline of the story
Before I read the morning news
It's not to late to recognize
that you're taking the best of me
I've waited long to see you change
But here we are and we're still the same

When it gets too crazy and I can't be found
I may be hiding in the silence of my mind
If you're looking for me but I can't be found

When Curtis Jackson was yet to crawl
He had a photo of a Gran Torino
From Ohio to the wall

He got deeper into the sound
When the big debate was Watergate
My Lina and my brotha made it clear like makin' love

He remembers the boogie boy down the house
The DJ's turnin' out in 1975
He surrenders this total incomplete down to his dancing feet
And he gave it up for love, and he gave it up for love

He gave it up for love
He gave it up for love

What is left for us to say between hello and goodbye
Any day now you'll close the door, and walk away

Well that's the way it goes

Of all the things I said
And the promises I made you
On the day that we first met
But ain't that just like you baby

And you talk out loud
Dragging the night into my day

and demanding
It hurts me I won't lie
can't we give one more try
what we need is a little understanding

Don't turn around baby don't you doubt
Don't walk away cause we can work it out
Baby we've been here before
Even closer to that door.
Baby kiss me let's fall in love again
Come closer now cause i don't want to fight
I can think of better ways that we can spend the night
Baby we've been here before
Even closer to that door

And raced through the burning building out to the pavement.
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames.
And when it was all over I said to myself,
'Is that all there is to a fire?'"

Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends,
Then let's keep dancing.
Let's break out the booze
And have a ball
If that's all there is.

"And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to the circus, the greatest show on earth.
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears and a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.

Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me

It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight

Those
Schoolgirl days
Of telling tales
And biting nails
Are gone
But in my mind
I know
That they
Will still live
On and on
But how
Do you thank
Someone
Who has taken you
From crayons
To perfume
It isn't easy
But I'll try

If you wanted
The sky
I would write

Phir thoda t, then I take it easy

But your diamonds lie within your soul
You can't count your cash 6 feet under, stiff and cold, cold

I never meant a single thing when you tried it
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair
It got moved into view, then I liked it

I never meant a single word when I said I could love you
I thought it, I heard it, I used it
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours
'Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it

There's a message in the middle of the bottom
You see 'em, you love 'em, you got 'em
There's a proper time to pick 'em when they're fallen
Just listen, you'll hear 'em a callin'

There's a special way to know you got his lovin'
Can't you feel it, you ought to, you taught him
There's a special time for lovin' and another time
For huggin' and a lot of time to leave him alone

I have a feelin' deep inside that I've got you
I'll keep you, why not? It'll make me feel better
If there's a woman on this earth who should love you

Caught for a while
Under a wave that's breakin'

Such love, none other could compare
Do you remember when you were loving me?
Holding me? How could this love not be?

You seem to lead
Two lives at a time
Do I still fit in
I thought you were mine

Sitting at the bar
In our favorite café
I turn to see you laughing with her
And your smile fades away
Didn't suprise me
There's nothing left to say
I've got you red-handed now
And you can't walk away

You were caught in the act
When you thought I wasn't looking at you
C-I-T-A
I can see what you're doing
Caught in the act
And I can't stand to hear your lies

Let me fill you with my charms, Chaka

I'll make it more than just a physical dream
I wanna rock you, Chaka, baby
'Cuz you make me wanna scream
Let me rock you
Rock you

Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your kiss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody (Nobody)

I never meant a single thing when you tried it

I never meant a single word when I said I could love you
I thought it, I heard it, I used it
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours
'Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it

There's a message in the middle of the bottom
You see 'em, you love 'em, you got 'em
There's a proper time to pick 'em when they're fallen
Just listen, you'll hear 'em a callin'

There's a special way to know you got his lovin'
Can't you feel it, you ought to, you taught him
There's a special time for lovin' and another time
For huggin' and a lot of time to leave him alone

I have a feelin' deep inside that I've got you
I'll keep you, why not? It'll make me feel better
If there's a woman on this earth who should love you

Fate, now I understand

All we knew it was love we were feeling
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning

Throw my heart away each Spring

All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling
Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most
Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most
All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it

Like the snow in the summer

I know it's gonna be all better
When you touch me (oh, oh, give it to me baby)
Love can't wait, You'll never get away

Rockets launch us to outer space
Far away from this human wasteland
We're bringing heaven to other worlds
Abandoning the home fires of our birth 
There are fools who believe we can't live here as one
There are wise men who say it still can be done

Chorus:

I'm watching the world
I'm watching the change in power
I'm watching the world
Are we building a future or just standing still?

We will harvest the fields of wheat
For a promise of food to eat
Forging plows to make swords for war
We can stop this fighting and open the door

A penny has two faces
When one of them you have to choose
Between the two places

You say you have a sense of freedom
Whenever you're away from here
Put your hand on your heart and tell me
That you never shed a tear

Ooo, what you doing babe
On the other side of the world
With all those fancy girls
Never believe their hearts are stolen

I've been thinking 'bout you, my baby

But as hard as they try

I can't be loved
By anyone but you, oh baby, baby
It's not enough
There ain't no substitute for you

I can't be loved

No one seems to understand

I'm afraid it's getting out of hand

"I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire.
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms
And raced through the burning building out to the pavement.
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames.
And when it was all over I said to myself,
'Is that all there is to a fire?'"

Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends,
Then let's keep dancing.
Let's break out the booze
And have a ball
If that's all there is.

"And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to the circus, the greatest show on earth.
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears and a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.

Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together

So weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me

Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your kiss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody (Nobody)

When it's this good, there's no saying no

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall

Through the fire, through whatever Come what may
For a chance at loving you

Right down to the wire, even through the fire

A long time ago in the 40? s
Dizzy and bird gave us this song
They called it a night in Tunisia

The, the melody still lingers on

Max and miles to name just two
Together they grew
The music was young and strong

When you walked into my lonely life tonight
I saw my destiny, I saw eternity tonight
And the moment I held you I knew it
What we do is decided before we do it

Fate, this can only be
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in
Fate, now I understand
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman

Time stood still, and we were lost on words to say
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away
All we knew it was love we were feeling
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning

Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling
Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most
Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most
All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it

I'll make you melt
Like the snow in the summer
'Cause you're blowin' my mind
I know it's gonna be all better
When you touch me (oh, oh, give it to me baby)
Love can't wait, You'll never get away

Tearin' it up, tearin' it up
You were tearin' it up
Tearin' it up, tearin' it up

I'm feeling so divine, it must be a crime, don't take it away, no
More than a few told me, "I love you", now, I know better
'Cause when it got down to you somehow I knew
My number was up for some sweet, sweet lovin'

Keep givin' me lovin', lovin', your lovin', lovin'
 (Ooh yeah)
Keep givin' me lovin', lovin', your lovin', lovin'
 (Ooh yeah)

Cold endless summer days
Since you went away
Tore my heart in two
And now wandering through the night

Love you all my lifetime
Lost to you eternally

Baby when you need me
Wintertime or anytime at all
I'll be right there for you

More and more than all the stars above

And I say boy I love the way you walk

It's five a.m. when you walk in
This is where your story begins
You say you've been out with the fellas
But the perfume tells me where you've been

Well I knew for sure, when you walked through the door
You had another lover
I read the signs, but I tried to hide
All the pain I felt inside

You can make the story right
I believe what you say though you tell me lies

Big brown bedroom eyes
They're bad for me
Reluctantly you hit me
To my vulnerability

I don't like this feeling
'Cause I can't see straight
Something says I met my match
Courtesy of fate, alright

I've always taken pride
In my independence
So afraid and careful
Not to show it

No, but you give me clarity
Like a bright green laser beam
I think you want what's best for me

Utna hi nichhe

Mujhe bataa hai padai zaruri hai
Lekin studio mein jaana meri majboori hai
A square b square formula eh hain kitne
Dhundh ke dikhao kalakaar mere jitne

Pehle mera school phir meri tuition
Phir thoda t, then I take it easy
Bunk mara pucche principal

Well, well
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

I, I can't explain
How you got inside my system
But I feel the sweetest pain
I, I can't do that
But I've got to break this tension
If it makes you feel the same

An ordinary woman
That's all I am
And I think I'm fallin'
For an ordinary man

Take me to your heart
When the love begins
You and I can only try
To make a love with no strings

Take me to your heart
When the story ends
You and I, we can't deny

Another time you were the one in my life
And this world of mine just turned around you

Another time I would've run to you
I finally learned that I could love somebody new
And now I'm finally over you

But don't look at me that way

Kick it love, see her little baby

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely

Max and miles to name just two
Together they grew
The music was young and strong

When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall

Don't you know you're my everything?
Ooh, oh, sweet thang

I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
To love you, child, my whole life long
Be it right or be it wrong

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your kiss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody (Nobody)

I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me

If you heard the whole thing before

Oh I had to go away to finally know
How much I need you back, I need your love

My love is alive, yeah yeah yeah

Well there's something inside that's makin' me crazy
Tryin' to keep it together

I'm in the mood to end these empty days
Ever when I, you stare down romancin'

Colder than ice with no more flame

I think our love has reached the part of no return

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

That distant look is all you've got to say
Every time I try to talk to you

Lovers walk off on each other
Brothers go their separate ways
You wake up somewhere in the middle
Wondering why nobody stays
You are a child of wild desires
When your innocence leaves, yeah
Why you want to play with fire
Here I am
Here I am

Je m'appelle la Flamme

Oh
Set off your alarm
(Oooh, ce soir)
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll take care of everything

You gotta hold her now
Never leave her, never let her go

You think you lost her number but you've only lost a little bit of time
She's waitin' just to see you boy, a continental girl so fine
Mirrors on the ceilin' make it hard for you to sleep at night
The opportunity is now, you know you got to do what's right

So, you take yourself down to her, before it gets too late
There's no need to telephone, 'cause this can hardly wait
The meaning of a moment, has never been so strong
A girl like this, a night like this, it's right where you belong

You gotta hold her now, never leave her
Tell her ho, you're gonna love her, squeeze her
Hold her now, never leave her, again
Never leave her again, don't you go

When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever Come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Answers aren't clear
I thought we made a promise
Now you've disappeared
You seem to lead
Two lives at a time
Do I still fit in
I thought you were mine

Sitting at the bar
In our favorite café
I turn to see you laughing with her
And your smile fades away
Didn't suprise me
There's nothing left to say
I've got you red-handed now
And you can't walk away

You were caught in the act
When you thought I wasn't looking at you
C-I-T-A
I can see what you're doing
Caught in the act
And I can't stand to hear your lies
