Good lovin', body rockin' all night long, yeah
Makin' love until we tire to the break of dawn
But oh, come on, come on and turn the lights down, and let me get on it, yeah

The fever for da flavor and girl you know it's on
The fever for da flavor and girl you know it's strong
The fever for da flavor and girl you know it's on
The fever for da flavor and girl you know it's strong

Of breaking me down into two
Cause those the things you can't do
So I got the fever for da flavor

Tu eres todo lo que quiero ver
Haria cualquier cosa porque rias de una vez
Sé que no soy tan bueno como crees
Pero al estar contigo me transformo en lo que ves
Si el tiempo se para cuando te veo
Si cada caricia por tu piel es un paseo
Si te beso es porque de verdad yo lo deseo
Me gusta tu cara enfadada cuando bromeo
Eres la Julieta que muere por su Romeo
Eres la nota mas bonita de mi solfeo
Por un mar de lágrimas del corazón buceo
Me enamoras solo con un gesto y pestañeo
Y es que yo vivo por ti
Por la vida que me entregas
Por el momento de felicidad que me congela
Por el futuro que nos espera
Por el pasado, el encargado
De que este destino nos uniera

And tell me what you need
Cause I just want to
Taste the sweetness
From your body

Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down
Come on let me lick you around
Up and Down

You will feel my fire
