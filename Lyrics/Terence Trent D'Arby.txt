She is negative as can be
And she's weak emotionally
But she kissed me
And she put it there
She's got a chip on her shoulder blade
And her attitude makes me afraid
But she kissed me
And she put it there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

Now do you love me like you say you do baby?
(Do you love me like you say you do?)

Listen baby, until I find the river
I won't be satisfied with who I am
In my Monasteryo your love ran hot or cold
Symphony or damn
I wanna be careful not to lose by laughter
What I've gained by tears
So here's a question baby
You answer I most need to hear

Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love

My best lines
Working on her, working on her overtime
Working on her, working on her clever mind
Working on her, working on her sleek lines
She's sure fine
As fine as Whitney Houston in the daytime
Working on her, working on her big time
Looking at her, looking at her waistline

Baby let me share my love

A delicate advance
A delicate retreat
Delicately planned
Delicate like peace

She never wanted to be my neon messiah

I prayed it wasn't more blood
Than your month could stand
I didn't hear you say
Kick my pedestal away

I'm seventeen and under the illusion
A girl like you could end my confusion
Penelope please
Penelope please

My jeans are not
Big enough to hold me
So come on girl
Don't you try and scold me
Penelope please
Penelope please

You will still be home in time
To watch the 'Pops' featuring Chrissie Hynde

I know you see me as an aggravation
I dream of you in full moon frustration
Penelope please
Penelope please

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You are beautiful to me
Wet your lips and let's do a thing
With a view to make your spirit sing
I have come to be your man
In a strange and hostile land
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You are blood and wine to me
Wet you lips
And let's do a turn
With a view to make your body burn

You chose with age
To speak with a prima ballerina's rage
And speak of all the kingdoms
That would swoop down
Stick around
Then proceed to ignore you

No flash pot pan, guitar man
Or resurrected Apollo myth
To seal your fate
Feed your plate
And just plain worship and adore you
But the pills you swill
Bring you no thrill
So travel lightly on the wing this time
Leaving all your baggage behind

As you wander through your vagabond stage
And find yourself shovelling shit
With a rusty jack-handle queen of a broken spade
You must not be afraid
You must turn the page

You wore your goddess down
In jaundiced disarray
Your halo fell into decay
Swiped by those you loved
But could not hold in sway behind you
And then the dry spell leaves
At a low shutter speed
Long enough for you to see
...

She was a paragon of soft scented chinois curls
She stood with nothing on
As we watched my flag unfurl
We fell in love so fast
That it spun my head around
Her coffee tawny skin
Sent my blood pressure up and down
Castilian blue
Castilian blue
I never ever thought
I'd be so taken by a girl like you

Lavender scented pillows

That has nothing to do whatsoever with my time

Yet you knew the tension inside the sweetness was so near
She stated very clear

In a way that needs noain

Frankie and johnny were lovers alright

As an aid and a comfort
I can see what you're going through

Look me in the eye

In a molecular world

And I sit and wait for you

Give me your tears

She feels that she's a worldly girl
But man you've been around the world

Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

Can you transform the pain you feel?
The birds of prey have swallowed
The breadcrumbs you left behind
To find your way back from the soul mines

But sooner or later

I left the east side for a west coast beauty
A girl who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read

They say that all poets must have and unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought provoking fears

But holding on to you means letting go on pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you

I left the rough side for a seaside baby
A chamomile smile that pouts on cue
For every moment I breathe her sigh

The answer is yes

How many ways do I have to find
To tell you that you're mine all mine
Does a moth fly to a flame?
Does a man cling to his name?
Turn your head around my sweet babe
Look at me and

Read my lips I dig your scene
Read my lips I dig your scene
I'm a match and you're kerosene

Was only interested in trying to bring you down
Tear you down and keep you down

Undeniably I love you
Undeniably I love you

Baptized by the fire in your eyes I was mesmerized

Alone in a car driving me far to get to you today
The wind at my wings whispering things for me to say
The moon is in view when I get to you
Alone in a car driving me far to get to you today
The wind at my wings whispering things for me to say
The moon is in view when I get to you
These tender moments are a precious few
'Cause we don't have that much time together
'Cause we don't have that much time together

The smell of your skin and I begin
To kneel and to pray to you
Your sensual caress makes me confess my love for you
As we're making love we can't get enough
The clock is never kind when we unwind

You're looking more like a real fine woman every day
And you look like the kind of girl who likes to play
Would you dance with me if I lied
And told you you were fine? (hey I'm only kidding,

Would you play with me?
And let me eat you like a watermelon rind
Get over here girl

And I was a car, we didn't get real far
We took a highway full of black top roadkill
Could that be me?

In the 2nd dream you were a rifle
And I was a deer but with no shelter near
You were camouflaged
In pain I couldn't see through
Could that be me?

Have you had your death today
And felt the loneliness of what you can't explain?
Have you had your death today
And resurrected joy from the jaws of pain?

As a dark angelcalls my name
I won't answer (loneliness)
Arid landscapes call for me to be the desert cancer

Have you had your resurrection
And seen old opinions formed swept away?
Have you had you soul baptism on a ragged flame
And felt the loss of shame and seen the world had changed?

She is negative as can be
And she's weak emotionally
But she kissed me
And she put it there
She's got a chip on her shoulder blade
And her attitude makes me afraid
But she kissed me
And she put it there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

You lead a life inside of your mind
That has nothing to do whatsoever with my time
She stated very clear
She made it very plain

Your subplot world is so cavalier
Yet you knew the tension inside the sweetness was so near
She stated very clear
She made it very plain
In a way that needs noain

Frankie and johnny were lovers alright

Come and go with me children

Beautiful soul don't keep it in
Can you transform the pain you feel?
The birds of prey have swallowed
The breadcrumbs you left behind
To find your way back from the soul mines

But sooner or later
Sooner or later you'll feel the spirit move you
And it'll come down to this, vibrator
It'll come down to this, vibrator
It'll come down to

Beautiful child of God and man
There's a messiah inside of you

Hey you! Give up to the ghost

Shout it out
Don't let it stay inside

When you're my age
You'll learn
From all you've left behind

If you all get to Heaven
Say a prayer for my mother
Say a prayer for my father
Say a prayer for my brother
But most of all please say a prayer for me

Words of a feather
All flock together
Going round and round
A soul is astral travelling
Watching human motion
Wasting thy seed upon the ground
Discreet intermissions
Coroners petitions
Their work goes into the sand
Voices from the middle
Are gaining very little
It's getting all out of hand

If you all get to Heaven
Say a prayer -volace menteh-
Say a prayer for food and plenty
Say a prayer -sehr sensible-
But most of all please say a prayer for me

I was born by the river in a little old tent
And just like the river I've been running ever since
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
It's been too hard living but I'm afraid to die
'Cos I don't know what's out there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes, it will
Then I go to my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please"

To tell you that you're mine all mine
Does a moth fly to a flame?
Does a man cling to his name?
Turn your head around my sweet babe
Look at me and

I kissed her lips in a perfumed pavillion
And all the subtleties that we could find
Blowing grace notes through my mind

Oh, but her hand brought such sweet pain
The kiss, yet all powerful, saved face twice
And turned your bad seed to grain
Ripping the roots of my heart again

I held her hand in an unchanging moment
She was feeding me love like she was holding a spoon
But her head was turned by a raging moon
And she would be gone by the next afternoon

Hollywood memories are made from times such as these
But, I wouldn't feel sorry for me if I were you

In my shadow nature there's a private room
Where I keep my fear
Every now and then never knowing when

Slaying my dragons by trying to love them
Let's suspend some time together
Let's reduce our gravity
And remind ourselves of rainbows
And make love convincingly

Since we're parking in each other's spaces
Would you visit me in my dark places?
Would you come and help me bring it into the light?
Would you visit me in my dark places?
Would you help me burn a candle into the night?

If ignorance is blissful then knowledge has made me wistful
Once upon a time I stayed within your dotted line
But you would never swallow that I was never born to follow

The coach instead of praising me said I should have made the pass
Once upon a time I ran with your lions in the field

I left the east side for a west coast beauty
A girl who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read

They say that all poets must have and unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought provoking fears

But holding on to you means letting go on pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you

I left the rough side for a seaside baby
A chamomile smile that pouts on cue
For every moment I breathe her sigh

That would swoop down
Stick around
Then proceed to ignore you

No flash pot pan, guitar man
Or resurrected Apollo myth
To seal your fate
Feed your plate
And just plain worship and adore you
But the pills you swill
Bring you no thrill
So travel lightly on the wing this time
Leaving all your baggage behind

As you wander through your vagabond stage
And find yourself shovelling shit
With a rusty jack-handle queen of a broken spade
You must not be afraid
You must turn the page

You wore your goddess down
In jaundiced disarray
Your halo fell into decay
Swiped by those you loved
But could not hold in sway behind you
And then the dry spell leaves
At a low shutter speed
Long enough for you to see

She is negative as can be
And she's weak emotionally
But she kissed me
And she put it there
She's got a chip on her shoulder blade
And her attitude makes me afraid
But she kissed me
And she put it there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

You're top man on the scene
You don't think life comes in between
But hey, she's just seventeen
She feels that she's a worldly girl
But man you've been around the world
She is just some worried daddy's girl
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way

Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

I left the east side for a west coast beauty
A girl who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read

They say that all poets must have and unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought provoking fears

But holding on to you means letting go on pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you

I left the rough side for a seaside baby
A chamomile smile that pouts on cue
For every moment I breathe her sigh

And if in time the day's defeat
Should seal those lips I love so sweet
I'd catch up to her wandering feet
And lay the law down upon her sheets
And if in time this love should pass
And throw my heart upon the grass
I wouldn't hang on to the past
I'd sell my sorrows for a glass
And pull myself from this morass
And save myself this sombre cast

If you all get to Heaven
Say a prayer for my mother
Say a prayer for my father
Say a prayer for my brother
But most of all please say a prayer for me

Words of a feather
All flock together
Going round and round
A soul is astral travelling
Watching human motion
Wasting thy seed upon the ground
Discreet intermissions
ners petitions
Their work goes into the sand
Voices from the middle
Are gaining very little
It's getting all out of hand

If you all get to Heaven
Say a prayer -volace menteh-
Say a prayer for food and plenty
Say a prayer -sehr sensible-
But most of all please say a prayer for me

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell

Teardrops rusting on a steel bar
Harmonica blues
Heartblood thick enough for pine tar
I've got a hole in my delta shoes
Grown men wither and they dry away
Their lives compromised
I've gotta hold on
Struggle through another day
To see the fire in my baby's eyes
Society's debt have been more than paid

In seven more days
I'll be home to you
And the walls will tumble down
That's separating us two
The Jericho mile and a river so wide
In seven more days

Far from a river where things grow green
The flowers weep and they lean away
From the blood stained soil beneath my feet

On propaganda page
That will rule your life and fuel my rage

I am still endeavouring to find a few roads to peace

I chased your shadow all around the world
New York to London... won't you slow down, girl
Hey taxi driver, won't you follow her...

And I don't want to hear no jive

"How 'bout working' late?"
I told him: "It's Friday...
You know I've got a date."

Six o'clock, and I'm almost through...
I took a shower, shaved...
And put on my blue suede shoes
Picked up my lady,
And headed down the street
"Before we go to the disco, baby...
How 'bout something' to eat?"

Jumped in the disco

I was careful not to
Do it all again

That you care for the ones
Who really need it
But they go take off and run
Now I'm believing
In myself once more
Because I found someone
Who opens up the door

You made me cry
But she has made me laugh
She makes me whole
But you tore me in half
She makes me feel
I'm sexy... I'm hot...
I hope you're jealous

Rain rain
Go away, go away

Come back again another day

Step out your cool suit
Snap on you wet boots

Listen baby, until I find the river
I won't be satisfied with who I am

Symphony or damn
I wanna be careful not to lose by laughter
What I've gained by tears
So here's a question baby
You answer I most need to hear

And she's weak emotionally
But she kissed me

She's got a chip on her shoulder blade
And her attitude makes me afraid
But she kissed me

The way no other girl has kissed me there

The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

You're top man on the scene
You don't think life comes in between
But hey, she's just seventeen
She feels that she's a worldly girl
But man you've been around the world
She is just some worried daddy's girl
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way

Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

I left the east side for a west coast beauty
A girl who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read

They say that all poets must have and unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought provoking fears

But holding on to you means letting go on pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you

I left the rough side for a seaside baby
A chamomile smile that pouts on cue
For every moment I breathe her sigh

Grown men wither and they dry away
Their lives compromised
I've gotta hold on
Struggle through another day
To see the fire in my baby's eyes
Society's debt have been more than paid

In seven more days
I'll be home to you
And the walls will tumble down
That's separating us two
The Jericho mile and a river so wide

If you all get to Heaven
Say a prayer for my mother
Say a prayer for my father
Say a prayer for my brother
But most of all please say a prayer for me

Words of a feather
All flock together
Going round and round
A soul is astral travelling
Watching human motion
Wasting thy seed upon the ground
Discreet intermissions
ners petitions
Their work goes into the sand
Voices from the middle
Are gaining very little
It's getting all out of hand

Say a prayer -volace menteh-
Say a prayer for food and plenty
Say a prayer -sehr sensible-
But most of all please say a prayer for me

Far from a river where things grow green
The flowers weep and they lean away
From the blood stained soil beneath my feet

On propaganda page
That will rule your life and fuel my rage

I know the last few pages
Haven't been good for the both of us
And I've caused you a lot of grief
But put those bags down, o.k.?
Before you make a decision like that,
Please just listen to me
'Cos I don't want you to leave.
I definately don't want you to leave
Just hear me out.

Honey, don't leave me now
With my head on my shoulders wrong
Have I done something wrong for you to leave?
I know I've been careless, girl
And I must apologize
I'll try better next time, baby
If you let me stay

If you all get to Heaven
Say a prayer for my mother
Say a prayer for my father
Say a prayer for my brother
But most of all please say a prayer for me

Words of a feather
All flock together
Going round and round
A soul is astral travelling
Watching human motion
Wasting thy seed upon the ground
Discreet intermissions
ners petitions
Their work goes into the sand
Voices from the middle
Are gaining very little
It's getting all out of hand

If you all get to Heaven
Say a prayer -volace menteh-
Say a prayer for food and plenty
Say a prayer -sehr sensible-
But most of all please say a prayer for me

All I need from you
And that's all regardless of whatever you do
And that is that you understand

Teardrops rusting on a steel bar
Harmonica blues
Heartblood thick enough for pine tar
I've got a hole in my delta shoes
Grown men wither and they dry away
Their lives compromised
I've gotta hold on
Struggle through another day
To see the fire in my baby's eyes
Society's debt have been more than paid

In seven more days
I'll be home to you
And the walls will tumble down
That's separating us two
The Jericho mile and a river so wide
In seven more days

Far from a river where things grow green
The flowers weep and they lean away
From the blood stained soil beneath my feet

And the darkness amplifies the sound of printers' ink
On propaganda page

She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read

They say that all poets must have and unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought provoking fears

But holding on to you means letting go on pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain

A chamomile smile that pouts on cue

Keeping your prayers on time
Getting burnin' love in cities you can't recall

Gives you daytime, and the nighttime

And turned your bad seed to grain
Ripping the roots of my heart again

I held her hand in an unchanging moment

Now do you love me like you say you do baby?
(Do you love me like you say you do?)

Listen baby, until I find the river
I won't be satisfied with who I am
In my Monasteryo your love ran hot or cold
Symphony or damn
I wanna be careful not to lose by laughter
What I've gained by tears
So here's a question baby
You answer I most need to hear

Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love

My best lines
Working on her, working on her overtime
Working on her, working on her clever mind
Working on her, working on her sleek lines
She's sure fine
As fine as Whitney Houston in the daytime
Working on her, working on her big time
Looking at her, looking at her waistline

Baby let me share my love

Delicate like rain
Delicate like snow
Delicate like birds
Delicate just so
Delicate like air
Delicate like breeze
Delicate like you and me

A delicate advance
A delicate retreat
Delicately planned
Delicate like peace

She never wanted to be my neon messiah
She never wanted to be my neon messiah

I saw the blood dripping from your caring hands
I prayed it wasn't more blood
Than your month could stand
I didn't hear you say
Kick my pedestal away

I'm seventeen and under the illusion
A girl like you could end my confusion
Penelope please
Penelope please

My jeans are not
Big enough to hold me
So come on girl
Don't you try and scold me
Penelope please
Penelope please

You will still be home in time
To watch the 'Pops' featuring Chrissie Hynde

I know you see me as an aggravation
I dream of you in full moon frustration
Penelope please
Penelope please

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You are beautiful to me
Wet your lips and let's do a thing
With a view to make your spirit sing
I have come to be your man
In a strange and hostile land
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You are blood and wine to me
Wet you lips
And let's do a turn
With a view to make your body burn
...

You chose with age
To speak with a prima ballerina's rage
And speak of all the kingdoms
That would swoop down
Stick around
Then proceed to ignore you

No flash pot pan, guitar man
Or resurrected Apollo myth
To seal your fate
Feed your plate
And just plain worship and adore you
But the pills you swill
Bring you no thrill
So travel lightly on the wing this time
Leaving all your baggage behind

As you wander through your vagabond stage
And find yourself shovelling shit
With a rusty jack-handle queen of a broken spade
You must not be afraid
You must turn the page

You wore your goddess down
In jaundiced disarray
Your halo fell into decay
Swiped by those you loved
But could not hold in sway behind you
And then the dry spell leaves
At a low shutter speed
Long enough for you to see
...

She was a paragon of soft scented chinois curls
She stood with nothing on
As we watched my flag unfurl
We fell in love so fast
That it spun my head around
Her coffee tawny skin
Sent my blood pressure up and down
Castilian blue
Castilian blue
I never ever thought
I'd be so taken by a girl like you

Lavender scented pillows

You lead a life inside of your mind
That has nothing to do whatsoever with my time
She stated very clear
She made it very plain

Your subplot world is so cavalier
Yet you knew the tension inside the sweetness was so near
She stated very clear
She made it very plain
In a way that needs noain

Frankie and johnny were lovers alright

I know that it's your own life
I tell you this
With an eye on your future
Yes I know
Mind my own business
But I am here
As an aid and a comfort
I can see what you're going through
'Cause we've all been there before
But all in all
Here's that I'm wondering
I want to know
Are you happy?
Look me in the eye
And answer my question
I want to know
...

Whoever you are come forth
Come forth
These are the days that must happen to you
Come forth

I am a spirit
Up above your head
Though I rest in you
As though you were a bed
In a molecular world
In an electric state
I sing the praise of angels
And I sit and wait for you

Baby, baby, baby
Succumb to me
Baby, baby, baby
Succumb to me

Give me your tears
I'll keep them in a glass

I couldn't sleep last night wondering where were you?
In your mind I mean
Why didn't you scream?
Though I say the wrong thing now and then
I still love you

In my hour of passionate thought

I won't say goodbye
I don't want to use that exit line
Please don't make me lie
I have no excuse for you this time
'Cause sometimes
(It's alright for a season)
But then it's time to go

The verses of my life are moving past
...

You're top man on the scene
You don't think life comes in between
But hey, she's just seventeen
She feels that she's a worldly girl
But man you've been around the world
She is just some worried daddy's girl
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way

Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
