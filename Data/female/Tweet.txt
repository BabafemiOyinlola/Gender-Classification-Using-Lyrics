And I picked up a
Joy to my face
My heart beats faster
Than a regular pace
And I'm not sure
Of what it is
I asked my mother
To help me with it
And she said, "Daughter
You reached a Jones
And that's real lovin'
So carry on"

Come to my place
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
'Cause I really need you so
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
Be on your way
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
And we can handle it real slow

Why oh why (why)
Gave you several years of my life
And it just ain't right
What's your perception of love
Now how many times did we say it was over
And how many times did we not leave
There's no sense in this love hangover
Please come back to me
Cause I can't forget your ways
I still remember our first kiss

I'm nervous and trembling (smoking cigarettes at night)
Wondering where you been (smoking cigarettes at night)
I can't cope with this (smoking cigarettes at night)
You're the one to help me quit (smoking cigarettes at night)

In the midnight hour
Late in the midnight hour

*verse 1*
Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From the start it, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

*verse 2*
I tried and I tried to avoid
but this thing was happening
Swallow my pride
Let it ride and party
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

Do I wanna blow the score
Or just relieve you with this freak

But what if there's no love to lose?
If everyday I saw sunshine
And it, it never rained the blues

If my fear were tears
I wonder, could they fall
If a smile could stretch a mile
Even if I had no money at all

But I'm willin' to take
Whatever life brings
'Cause you're the only one
That seems to know me

And even if the bad times call
If I had you back
I wouldn't complain at all

Even if I had no hands to pray

Ooh done... yeah, loving

I'm in no need for love
Stretched this sister more than a mile
It's not for me because
There's no trust in love, so I'm restin' a while
How could u do me this way, love?
I can't recall how you made me smile
And I don't have time to play (with ya)
If I see ya, make it worth my while
Until then...

Seems like I've seen you before
Been watching you the whole night
Since you walked through the door

Seen you in my dreams
We were together, had a family,
It felt like reality

The key to turn me on and off

Even when she makes me mad (fussing and fighting)
All she does is crack a smile (it's alright and...)
Sometimes I wish it wasn't this way
But you just have this power over me

And now matter what...
I love you more
Hey Hey I do...

They called him Paul like his popsy was his names sayin'
There has been a lot of preasure tryna keep that name great
just because I got his name don't mean I'm him
people look at me like I'm supposed to be his twin
be his twin.
we're so different yeah we're still the same
he taught me how to be a man for that he's the blame
he's the blame.
For being a man and learn I gotta stand on my own, not spend my whole life tryna be his clone
crazy things that proposing never came from home
nope.
they came from outsiders who think the known him so back up you don't know me you don't understand
This is the life of a son of a preacherman

Started out a boy that didn't know the game
Didn't know the game
But so many years I remained the same
The same
Used to be a love maker, heart breaker, major part player
Never thought that my heart would ever change
But since then I have grown to know this much
What it really means to fall in love
But I don't know how I know
I just know baby you're the one for me

Could it be, could it be that I'm falling in love with you?
Tired of the same old thing
Same old thing
And playing all same old games
And if I could trade one thing, all I need is change for you
Boy I give anything, anything

You're good for nothing
And I ain't gonna cry over you
You hurt me in ways
But those days are through
Learn how to push from the pain
You didn't expect me to
With you always the same things
And I've had enough
Wasting my tears on you
Yes I've had enough
Wasting my tears on you
Reconciliation

He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey baby let's get away, go some place, huh?"
Where I don't care
He's the kind of guy that will give you everything
And trust your heart, share all of your love
'Til death do you part
I want to be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it
Lovin' him a little bit more each day
He turns me right on when I hear him say
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere huh?)

Time On My Hands
I Put My Feet On The Gas
On A Road Only Going One Way
And I Won't Turn Back
Blowin On With The Wind (Oh Yeah)
And Imma Let It Float Me Away From Here
See I Want Me Something Real
And Oh I Wont Stop Until Then

Help Me Find It…The Way To Love
The Way To Love (To Love)

I feel drained, there's so many thoughts on my brain
And I've had enough of going round
Chasing you boy
Play myself, here's what I'm gonna do
I'll let go, take back my heart
So turn it over,
Sooner or later, you'll be sorry
Soon as you say you're sorry
It will be too late, I'll be gone
I'll be gone
