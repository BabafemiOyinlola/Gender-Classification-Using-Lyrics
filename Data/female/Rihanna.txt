Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe

I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

Cos I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys-

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

I got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got all the drive but a whole lot'a boom in the back

Put on your brake lights

Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice

Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows
I'm unfaithful and it
Kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore

You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby you're my disease

I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, plode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go,

Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy then we can go all night

Goes from 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby you got the keys

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive

Start over drive with a whole lot of boom in the back.
You look like you can handle whats under my hood

If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl

Baby, come and share my world, share my world
If it's loving that you want
Come and take a walk with me, walk with me
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here, baby, baby

Now it's obvious you need a friend to come hold you down
Be that one you share your everything when no one's around
Baby, come tell me your secrets and tell me all your dreams
'Cause I can see you need someone to trust
You can trust in me

And I'm tired of waitin' baby while you still obey me
Want me come and whisper in your ear

'Cause if I get you alone I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time

I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye

Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole 'in love' thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinnin' 'round
And deep inside my tears I'll drown
I'm losin' grip, what's happenin'?
I strayed from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Ey, this is special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who you are

So live your life, hey, ay, ay, ay
You steady chasing that paper
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life, hey, ay, ay, ay
No telling where it'll take you
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just living my life, ay

Just living my life, ay
My life, oh, my life, ay, my life
Just living my life

Never mind what haters say
Ignore them 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay and no
They couldn't even work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away

I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more (coming back for more)

Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She's just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever

The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows

Kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy

I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command

No more gas, in the red

Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight? (Your mind is in)
Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like

Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry (please)
Just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go

Every little city I go, "Fuck me!"
Shawty must've heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by her bladder, she like, "Oh, I gotta pee!" Hahaha
Ran into a Rothko in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
Gotta have a ticket for a walk through
Everything I do is Big ("Who y'all talkin to?")
I talk big money, I talk big homes
I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I'm flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up
What's up?

One and two and a three and four
Come on, let me know if you want some more

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

I can't breathe but I still fight
While I can fight, as long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High of a love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
And I love it, wait where you going?

I'm leaving you

No, you ain't come back

We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman
With the wind in his bag
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude?
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight...
Is who's gonna run this town tonight...
We gonna run this town
We are
Yeah I said it
We are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get y'all black tees on
All black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds
Ridin' with they dillingers
I'd get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is la familia
I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma
Six zeros
Dot zero
Here it go...
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas
Now we squared up
Hold up
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now

What you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got, you know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey (You're gonna be a shining star)
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far

'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay

No telling where it'll take ya just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay (Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser just living my life(Ay)
Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away

Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way

Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray

Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it

Just wanna forget about it

And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now

And I just can't figure out why

Sorrow in my soul ‘cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside

I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend

Know that we'll still have each other

And give up this fear within
Of what would happen if they ever knew
I'm in love with you

'Cause I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance, to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
We'd make it through

A thousand dreams I still believe
I'd make you give them all to me

I surrender

(Ohh no!!) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch!)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (Fuck you!)
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal

Te amo, te amo
she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice.
then we danced underneath the candelabra
she takes the lead
that's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no,
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
but let me go
My soul is awry,
without asking why
I said te amo,
wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you

Te amo, te amo,
She's scared to breathe

Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Been waiting on that sunshine
Boy, I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gonna get it like that
So I argue, you yell, had to take me back
Who cares when it feels like crack?
Boy you know that you always do it right
Man, fuck your pride, just take it on back, boy
Take it on back boy, take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting bad man, and it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Wildflower, sacrifice everything
In a wonderland that you know
It's crazy that I'm clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be

Wildflower, sweet as the morning light
If I blink an eye, will you go?
I'm starting to care much more than I dare
A wonderful thing to see
And what do we know

First say, 'You love me'
And then say, 'You leave me'
But we never say goodbye

When I'm gone gone gone
When I'm gone
Soon when that moment comes,
I can say I did it all with love love love

And you're the one to blame

Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,

Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

Got up in the club
Posted in the back
Feeling so good
Looking so bad

Rocking this skirt
Rocking this club
Got my middle finger up
I don't really give a fuck

Rocking these diamonds
I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture
I'm rocking my fame

To be with you is
You gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing
Is a black guitar

I'm a rock star
Hey baby
I'm a rock star
Hey baby

Big city
White lights
Sleep all day
Up all night

Hey baby
I'm a rock star
Hey baby
I'm a rock star

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you’re
Feeling brave
There’s so much power
In my name
If you pop off in your seat
Steady
I’m gonna do the wave

I’m such a
Fucking lady
You don’t have to be
So afraid
Cause I got room
Up on my team
You can play
But hold up

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

It’s getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova
Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don’t you fumble
That’s a flag on the play
Babe if you don’t wanna
Then you don’t have to wait
But together

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
I need me a remedy

Take off my mask to breath

Fluid in the breaks
Was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm going
I don't need my breaks
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size 10
In my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right

So I made it
Even though Katy 
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right

Don't understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like Im stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this

They got their guns out, aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me

Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood

We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it

Rocking this skirt
Rocking this club
Got my middle finger up

Rocking these diamonds

To be with you is
You gotta be what you are

Pretty motherf*cker with the Mossberg
Jiggy motherf*cker at my concert
I'm wearing fox furs, liking Oxfords
Eating oxtails, sipping cochburg

Silly motherf*ckers looking awkward
So much dick riding now my cock hurt
... we running clockwork
So we got purp, and we got work

Tel Ri-Ri I go Re-retarded
On a remix had to re-recorded it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3
Como see me for it

I go cuckoo for your cookoo, your
Flying fish in my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick
It, hit it play games like soccer
When we kick it, get it?

No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant

(Youuuu)
suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then

Swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around

You come around
I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay

Set my whole body on fire
They mad at Rihanna game
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts

But Imma be the queen of your body parts
No one can do ya
The way that I do

Boy you know that you always do it right
Man, fuck your pride, just take it on back, take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting bad man, and it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone

We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better

You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with Little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah Imma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up

It was a crush
Now I might have went and said too much
But that's all it was
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

Gyeah, Rihanna
Good Girl Gone Bad
Take three, action

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone

We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better

You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with Little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

Baby, baby
When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy

I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore

Uh huh, uh huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh huh, uh huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (Take three, action)
Uh huh, uh huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank (Eh, eh, eh)
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone, we Roc-A-Fella (Eh, eh, eh)
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because...

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, Imma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you pushin' all my buttons, taking me out of my zone, yeah

The way that you stare, starts a fire in me
Come up to my room, my sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me

You're makin' stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
If you dont have to go, don't

Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor acting naughty
Your hands around my waist, just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play

So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget that I was upset
Can't remember what you did

But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong

But, I hate it

So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more

Sweet like sugar tell me what I wanna hear

And when it's meltin on my lips
A rush through my body

Feel it in my fingertips
You selling me your
Fantasy that I wanna explore
Sound so good
Spoil me rotten to the core, you know

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need

Is you beside me
It's destiny

Baby sell it to me

Sell me candy
Sell me love
Sell me heaven

Sell me doves

When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby you're my disease

Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab

Stare at myself in the mirror
Take me apart, piece by piece

Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me, before a decision, ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?

You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone, now she
In the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She's just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (gone)
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason

I don't know if I will find you, find you, find you
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you, right behind you

And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again I don't mind

Sticks and stones

May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me

Na na na na
Come on
Come on

Gyeah, Rihanna
Good Girl Gone Bad
Take three, action

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone

We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better

You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with Little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Nothing heard, nothing said

All my life on my head
(Don't want to think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort

Throw on your pretty lies
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't goin' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight
(Your mind's in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like

I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

Cos I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys-

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive

Got all the drive but a whole lot'a boom in the back

You're making staying over here, impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible

But now we're rocking on the dance floor, actin' naughty

Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face

But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
so that I cant stay mad at you

Shaking inside my bones

Come up to my room my sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease

All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She's just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad

So what are you tryna hide?

You hold my hand so tightly,

Standing by the door,

Blow your secret open wide

But I won't

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Pretty motherfucker with the Mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concert
I'm wearing fox furs, like in Oxford
Eating oxtails, sipping cochburg
Silly motherfuckers looking awkward
So much dick riding now my cock hurt
Pause
We runnin' clockwork
So we got ... and we got work
Tell RiRi I go re-retarded
On the remix, of the re-recording
On the CD, DVD, MTV, MP3, come see me...
Go koo koo for your coo coo
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Gon' hear crickets when I...
Gon' play games like soccer when we kick it, get it?

No one can do ya the way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant (Youuuuuu)

Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then
Swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my feminine
Set my whole body on fire
They mad at Rihanna game
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But Imma be the queen of your body parts

No one can do ya the way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant (Youuuuuu)

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand ya
Most everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like it for a while?

No, but you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget that I was upset
Can't remember what you did

But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong

But, I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said, I despise that I adore you

Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart, beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)

Uh huh, uh huh (Yea Rihanna)
Uh huh, uh huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (Take three... Action)
Uh huh, uh huh

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone, we Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's are better, You know me,
In anticipation, for precipitation. Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'd be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other

I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows
I'm unfaithful and it
Kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore

And I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing incessantly pressing the issue

Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken I'm never mistaken, but I can't control myself got me calling out for help

Baby, baby
When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Sak pasé!

I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why?

Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down

I know you won't, 'cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, just want out of here
Yeah, once I'm gone, ain't no going back

I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out(wait it out)

But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out(wait it out)
What now? Ohhhh what now?

I found the one he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But i'm numb again
...

Uh huh, uh huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh huh, uh huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (Take three, action)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank (Eh, eh, eh)
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone, we Roc-A-Fella (Eh, eh, eh)
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because...

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, Imma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever

Take the gun, and count to three

Got my middle finger up

Rocking these diamonds
I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture
I'm rocking my fame

To be with you is
You gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing
Is a black guitar

I'm a rock star
Hey baby

Hey baby

Big city
White lights
Sleep all day
Up all night

Hey baby

Wait your turn

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you’re
Feeling brave
There’s so much power
In my name
If you pop off in your seat
Steady
I’m gonna do the wave

I’m such a
Fucking lady
You don’t have to be
So afraid
Cause I got room
Up on my team
You can play
But hold up

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

It’s getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova
Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don’t you fumble
That’s a flag on the play
Babe if you don’t wanna
Then you don’t have to wait
But together

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
I need me a remedy

Never have I ever
Been a size 10

I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right

So I made it
Even though Katy 
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right

Don't understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like Im stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but

And she flies it better

Stack chips for the rainy day

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She's just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad

You should tell me whats buggin you
And Imma tell ya bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And Imma make it easy

And Imma make it easy

Emotions running wild
I could feel it when I'm next to you,
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay but wont tell me,
its about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?
I know what the look means
You hold my hand so tightly,
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door,
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide

()
So maybe if you say it
Tell me what it is you likeeee (likee)
Baby baby dont be shyyy (shyy)
Maybe you can spend the nighttt (nii-iii-iightt)
If you say it
But if you playin (not wit it)
Cuz you know what I wanna hear (hearr)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clearr)
I need to know how you feel
So baby why wont you (say it), say it (say it)

Gyeah, Rihanna
Good Girl Gone Bad
Take three, action

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone

We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better

You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with Little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella ella, eh eh eh)

Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it

Never lying, truth-teller

All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'mma rock this shit like fashion, as in
Going til they say stop and my
Runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (here)
No fear (feat) and while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (so hard)
Yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard (so hard)
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (so hard)
Yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard (so hard)

Du du du du du du
Du du du du du du

In a perfect world
We would make love over war
With our hands in the air
Got no problems, no care, oh no
Oh, no!

Oh, America!
Moving down to Africa
We keep singing
Now the world
Spining round and round
And round, and round, and round, and round

We will dance in the rain, despite of all the pain
What the world really needs is to feel love again

Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ship
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
But the hand of the Almighty
We forwad in this generation
Triumphantly
So won't you help to sing

I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I'm flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless

Take three, action

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone

We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better

You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with Little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Good weed, white wine

Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Oh, Let it play
Say you gotta leave but I know you wanna stay
You're just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text that I write is gonna say

Oh na na, what's my name?

Tip pon toe, now it's time to wine it slow (wining it, slow down)
If you like what you see, then you have to let ma know
Put your hand pon her back and pull her in close
Tip pon toe, wheel it back now here we go (here we go, now)
I cannot front,

Let's go!

Uh

You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head, girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head, girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head, girl
No use your lips keep moving, but I got a couple screws loose.
And other boys talking bout me, they say I'm bad miss, and probably best for you to keep it short, it's my turn, don't interrupt it, don't take a lot to start me up
I think you really wanna do it right now, and now with me, start with me, I gotta, gotta, gotta gun on me.
Don't think you really wanna run your mouth, that's how I'm feeling while you down, you burn it do-ow-own
All over your radio, see me in your stadium, ask anybody, I'ma rep this for the ladies so, watch your tone around me, Don't push my button, If you wanna see me get wild, ge-ge-get wild
I got a hole in my head, a hole in my head.
Sometimes I get crazy, and I ain't scared of nobody.
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said, I got a hole in my head, I am, I am.
I got a hole in my head I am, I am.
I got a hole in my head, I am, I am.
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said I got a hole in my head I am, I am
Buckle up, I ride just like a fast car, suck it up, don't even try to act hard, and you can try to run but you won't get very far, and you can try to hide, but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you, you got a hole in your head too, and I knew it the very moment i met you, so I hope you got your swagger up, you know just what I love doesn't take a lot to work me up
I think you really wanna do it right now, and now with me, start with me, I gotta, gotta, attitude on me, don't think you really wanna run your mouth, thats how I'm feeling while I'm down, while I'm dow-ow-own

Beautiful and dangerous
Hot and cold
Don't you see the light, boy

Til I get what you got

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down

Baby, baby
When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

You're makin' staying over here impossible

'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
...

I lick the gun when I'm done
Cause I know that revenge is sweet...
So sweet

This is a gang, ladies thang, baby bang
Tell me what you need, oh

Any mother fucker wanna disrespect
Playing with fire finna get you wet
How it feel down there on your knees

I got this girls like a soldier
Trip and its going down, down, down

I'm ready to roll
Girl I'm with you, whats it get you, to get me
So come on, lets go!
Bitch I'm with you if you with it, you with me

You know I'm down, I'm down for life
Load it, reload it and let's
(Go!) Gangster for life
Till the day that I die
I promise I'm standing high
Cause you know that I'm down, you know I'm down
Gangster for life

We driving by with them headlights off we know where you stay

Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
...

On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold Case Love (love, love)
And I let you reach me one more time but that's enough, oh

Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over it don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along, tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime of a
Cold case love, oh-oh, oh-oh ohh

Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally, on
The road that's headed away
From all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby we'll hear it when I'm gone
It's time to turn on
The last song (oh)
The last song (oh)
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
...

Ohh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah, standin' ovation
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry (please)
Just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining

Ay, this a special what's happenin' to all my, all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here, what you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna, let's get it)

So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya

Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away

Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray

I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away

Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid

I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts

Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

Put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind

Turn up the music

Tu-turn up the...

Turn up the music 'cause i feel a little turned on
Turn up the music, don't you try to turn me down.
Turn up the music can i feel it just a little bow

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one, so I make sure I'll behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

Baby, I love you I need you here with me all the time
Baby, we meant to be
You got me smiling all the time

Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back when I go runnin', runnin'
Tryna get away from loving ya
You know how to love me hard
I won't lie, I'm falling hard
Yep, I'm falling for ya but there's nothin' wrong with that

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one, so I make sure I'll behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one, so I make sure I'll behave

I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies kill
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Feeling with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thanking you, just don't know
Try to run from that, say you're done with that

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all see blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just summising
Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
...

Feeling it coming in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I m addicted to thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when nickels down
Got a problem tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind is who gon run this town tonight (Wassup)
Who gon run this town tonite (Wassup)

We gon run this town.
We are
Yeah I said it we are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on
All black everything
Black cards, blacks cars
All black everything
And that girls a black birds riding with their dillingers
I get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down
And I'm tryin get back
I gave doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Me I'm talking 5 comma 6 zero's, got zero's, (?)
Back to running circles round
Now we squared up, hold up.
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doing my own thing

Going til they say stop and my
Runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (here)
No fear (feat) and while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal

All of the lights (all of the lights)
(Lights, lights)
All of the lights (all of the lights)

[Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

(all of the lights)

Fast cars, shooting stars
(all of the lights, all of the lights)
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
(all of the lights, all of the lights)

If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life

[Kanye West]
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone... our n-gga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a n-gga replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university

[Chorus]
All of the lights
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
(all of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night
(all of the lights)

[Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
