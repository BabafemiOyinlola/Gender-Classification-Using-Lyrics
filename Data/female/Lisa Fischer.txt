All alone, on my knees I pray
For the strength to stay away
In and out, out and in you go
I feel your fire
Then I lose my self control

How can I ease the pain
When I know your coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain
When I know your coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart
How can I ease the pain

Everytime that I let you in
You take away something deep within

Help me
Save me
Save me
Save me

Creatures in wilderness
Ooh, wild are we
Pleasure seeker obsessed
His eyes on me
Him in his corner, me in mine
Circling around me
Surrounding me like fire
He pressed against me
Lips on mine
I stare into his eyes
...

I wanna get close tonight
The way that we used to be
I want you to stop on by
I need you here next to me

Tonight is a gone play night
You know how I love
Talking with you baby
Tonight is gonna be the night
That all this talking ends
And we love again

Chorus:

I always thought I couldn't be caught
Cause I was a cool and cautious kind
You know, I could take love or leave it
You have to make me believe it
Make me believe it

I always tried to keep it inside
To bite my tongue before I'd say
You're my only and one
You have to take the time to show me
Show me
Show me

But suddenly love's finally taken my breath away
It's so intense it doesn't make sense
So intense
Out of control love's blinding me
Like a brand-new light of day
It's so intense
...

Let the rain fall down upon her
She’s a free and gentle flower
Growing wild

People used to laugh at me
When I was a little girl
I guess they didn’t understand
But when you’re young and all alone
You make up things
For the things that are missing

Ooh, how I used to love to dress up
In my mother’s clothes
It made me feel like somebody
I’d pretend I was the prettiest girl
At the dance
And all the boys loved me

And I was gonna be a big success
But of course I never got that dress
For my very own
I didn’t do half the things I thought I’d do
But I guess the good part of my life
Is that I did find you

And you know
Now when I look into a little girl’s eyes
It’s like a mirror
And I remember, I remember

She's faced the hardest times
...

Send the message of love
Let the world know it's time to make a change
Send it right from your heart
It's the right place to start to make a change

The world's supposed to be a loving place
But sometimes I look around
And I don't see a friendly face
We can change it if we could try
We can keep good love alive

You see
People walk about cause they have no home
Feeling hopelessly rejected and so alone
We can change that if we try
We can keep goodness alive

If your love is what you give to me
I'll give love in return
I'm thankful but there's still a lot to learn
So I pray for the ones
Who have no love (they need love too)
Yes, this is what I think we've got to do

Send the message of love

Pick myself up
Right where you left me
Yes, life goes on
On without you
Maybe the others fell apart
But, darling
I broke your...
(Chorus)
Chain of broken hearts
Darling, listen

I knew that this was coming
The day me made the final break
I'm kinda glad it happened this way
There's not much more I can take
It's never easy when you have to bid love farewell
Right now I'm in a daze
I only hope I live to tell

Tears will dry
Make room for new ones I will cry
Pain subsides
We'll both survive the last goodbye
