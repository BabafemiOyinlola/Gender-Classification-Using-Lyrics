Good Morning, Good Morning (lennon/mccartney)
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's o.k.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town

When I'm away from you, boy
All I seem to do is cry
And then when I see you, boy
My, how the time does fly
I don't know if you need and love me
The way I love and need you

I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
...

When hearts are buried deep, too deep read
When life starts falling down, just look up
Comfort can be found, just look to me
I'll shelter you, on that you can depend
We will always win
And when the night is dark, too dark to see
You'll never lose you way, just stay
Stay right here beside me
(I've got your love to guide me)
I won't be afraid anymore, my heart will lead the way

Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you
Whoa-oh-oh, kiss me like you just did
Oh, baby, do that to me once again

Pass that by me one more time
Once is never enough for my heart to hear
Whoa-oh-oh, tell it to me one more time
...

Whoa whoa whoa oh ho ho
Ooh ooh yeah
Ah, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh

Girl, I love you so
I promise you I'll never let you go
Till the end of time
You will always be forever mine, baby

We will share our joy
We'll care and understand each other, boy
A love that's built on trust
I'll never love again, you're the only one

You give me all that I need
And I can't get you out of my mind
We have the love everyone wants
And we know it's real, 'cause the way we feel
It was so hard to find

Just like Romeo and Juliet
Our love is strong and stronger we'll get
Like a hand in glove, nothing's closer than this
That's what love is
(Oh oh, baby oh)

Your touch, your tender kiss
Your smile I can't resist
No one can love me better
Until the end of time we'll be together

You're a special part of me

Mmm... mmm... hmm...

I've been tryin' to tell myself I don't need you
Trying to hold back the feelings I feel for you
Knowing in the end there's no future for you and I
I can't tell no lie

(Baby, be mine) You never really got to know me
(Baby, be mine) I should have said it at the time
(Words left unspoken)
They only gave you a token of my love, ooh

Take a second chance, see what you're missing
I'm just somebody you don't know as well as you think you do
So understand me this time
Baby, be mine

(Baby, be mine) You never really got to know me
(Baby, be mine) I should have said it at the time

Diz que ia me pegar
E hoje tinha sacanagem
Que era maluca, que era da malandragem
Mas na hora "h", virxii
Tô vendo que você é muito gelo e pouco whisky

Bem que me falaram que você
Gosta mesmo é de aparecer

Ohhoohoh

So you don't wanna talk to me
Just don't even call me anymore

Though you don't call me anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane

I wanna tell you, baby
The changes I've been goin' through
Missin' you, missin' you
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had have to set me free, baby
I guess I'll swallow my pride
Beggin' you, baby, baby, baby, please see me

Hey girl, you're runnin' away from me
I can't give you any more than honesty
I must read like an old love letter
Little girl, it's now or never

We've had some time to learn the rules
I'm so bad at wearing other peoples shoes
I really thought that we could be together
And that's why, its now or never, it's now or never

And like a candle burning
Both ends are melted all through
My hourglass is turning
I can't live this life without you

Oooh

Oh baby baby yeah
I've heard it said
that good things come to those who wait
And i thought you were my good thing
coming a  little late

You wined and dined me
You even showed up on time
you liked to bring me roses
And I thought you were so divine
And now you say that you don't want me
You say you found somebody new
Someone who loves you too

You made me love you
just like nobody could
You made love you
And I cared for you
Oh
And I won't regret it
Yeah
I just can't get it out of my mind 

I've had the thrills

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying

You say that you miss me
How I wish those words were true
But your arms are never here to hold me
When my heart gets lonely
Your words make me confused

First you said she was just a convenience
A place to stay
Now you say that you shared so much more
Oh, when will you stop
Playing games with my heart

If you still love her
Why are you leading me around?

Searching for love that's true
I didn't know it was you
All the time

Questions marks between us two
Then I looked at you
And I knew it was true
Never thought I'd feel this way

When I was

Now, I'm craving your body,
Is this real
Temperatures rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
Woahh and I'm; longing to love you
Just for a night,
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
With all my might
Reasons, the reasons that we hear,
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings a-won't disappear
Oooh! And- after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade
