Why can't I find somebody else
When I know, know that you're doing wrong
It's so hard, hard to let go

I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back

Keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back

Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (one time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love I give to you
I live for you baby

I bust the windows out your car
And no it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you'll see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile

But I think that I deserve to smile

I bust the windows out your car

I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair

But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task
Why it don't last?
Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?

Sorry if I sound so filled with gloom
You say you care and I know you do
But this is from my experience
And my conclusion only makes sense

Just 'cause I love you and you love me
It doesn't mean that we're meant to be
I can climb mountains, swim cross the seas
But the most frightening thing is you and me

I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears

He did it again, he hit me

Listen to me
I’ma kill him, I know I’ma kill him, mama
Listen to me, get your stuff and come home
I can’t come home, mama, I’ma kill him, I’ma do it

I'm sitting contemplating
Is it worth it, should I take it?
Take that shot and change my life
Get that glock and take his life

Hospitals and bloody noses
This would end all, I suppose
That I could leave, knowing I can’t leave
So it’s either him or me

’Cause he’s gon' kill me if I stay, I know
Gon' kill me, he can’t change, I know
From the first time that he did it
Made a promise that he'd quit it

Shit, it’s gotten so much worse
Don't wanna end up in a hearse
I guess I gotta do it first
Guess I gotta do it first

Walked up the stairs and then I turned on the lights
Couldn't even speak because it happened so quick

I wish I never saw your punk ass that night
You always seem to calm me down with your lies

He said he'd like to get to know me
Just a little more, asked me to dinner
I said, "I'd bring my girlfriend"
He said, "That's cool"

'Cause he was gonna bring
His best friend but something happened
That I wasn't expecting his best friend
All night has my attention

Know it was wrong, I couldn't help it
And I don't care, I'm bein' selfish
Know what I want
And I want your best friend

Ain't gonna front, uh, uh

With a "Don't Disturb" on the doorknob
Then I buy a cheap dress every Friday
Cause I go to every show on the weekend
And I gotta look good when I'm reppin' him

And gotta move to Atlanta, we about to go

But the label said he should be single

Well baby fuck you and then the new crew that you're rollin' with

Writings on the wall but I can't see the words

I bust the windows out ya car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crobar

I bust the windows out your car
And no it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part

I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it 'cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel, when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when

You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile
ha ha ha ha ha

I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it 'cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark

Why can't I find somebody else
When I know, know that you're doing wrong
It's so hard, hard to let go

I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back

Keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back

Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (one time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love I give to you
I live for you baby

You did me wrong for the last time
And I took so much from you, baby
But you really crossed the line
You know I ain't mad for nothing

I call my momma, she go to my cousins
And they ain't never liked you
From the beginning
So listen I'm giving you only ten seconds to go

One, two, three
(Four)
Five, six, seven
(Oh, oh)

Eight, nine
(Baby, we getting closer)
Just don't let me get to ten
(Oh, boy)

You broke my heart
With all your lies
You really should look for an exit
'Cause you running out of time

I can put my best dress on, get my hair all done for you
And you still wouldn't say I'm pretty, no
And I can spend my whole life doing everything you asked me to
And you wouldn't appreciate what I'm giving, no, no, no

And if I'm not good enough, then baby there's the door
I bet you, you won't find another who gon' give you more
Baby I don't wanna waste my time changing how you feel
If you don't want me, someone else will
If I'm not, if I'm not good enough

I can fly around the world and back in 80 days
And it's still not fast enough baby
Give you every dime I got, you see it's all for you to take

I don't want your number, boy, just want your body
You can keep the conversation for some other hottie
I got a one-track mind, baby don't worry
No dinner dates or movies, just come on and hurry

It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home another night
It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home

Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on
Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on

I met him at the state store, he was tryin' ta holla
I ain't care if he was old enough to be my father
I knew his wife and went to school with his daughter
He was the boss that I knew went harder

Gave me my first taste bud, I had to take it farther
I mean I had to go harder

I started callin' up his crib just to get him
And I ain't even care, asked his wife if she was with him
Came home late and he got into a fight
And he called me that night

He said he never want to see me on the block
I said, "I don't need you but I need that rock"

I couldn't take it so I had to go see him
Stole my momma car and drove around all evening
And when I found him, I thought that he would lace me
I ain't got no money but you know I'll let you taste me

He pulled his gun out and told me I was stupid
I started crying, prayed to God, he wouldn't do it

Help please, Lord, I plead, just save me
(If you're really there)
Hear the sinner's prayer
(This is my redemption song)
Redemption song

Oh, give me just a minute, just a second
I gotta get it off my chest
Ain't no competition, when you're in it
Let you know that you're the best

If I never told you baby
I really do appreciate it
Keep on like you do and I'll always be true

Because no one, no not no one ever made me feel
(No one, no one)
Like I could be dreaming 'cause you can't be real

(And it makes)
Makes me so happy, yes it makes me cry
(Yes it makes)
And I know you're looking at me probably thinking why but

Excuse me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
One I've been hoping and waiting for

I had high hopes for us baby.
like I was on dope for us baby.
chasing after high that I
would never get back again
So we turned into 3 long years
and it became painfully clear

that we, we would never see those days again
But I guess forever, doesn't last to long
Forever, doesnt last to long

I ain't usually lost for words
This has got to be a first
And I'm tryna find the reason why I'm
Stu- stu- stu- stuttering

Something funny's happening
I'm at a place I've never been
And there's got to be a reason why I'm
Stu- stu- stu- stuttering

Every time you look my way
Something in me feels so strange
And I'm starting to think you are why I'm
Stu- stu- stuttering

I said hel, hel, hel, hello
And my, my, my, my, my name is
And it's so frustrating 'cause I don't wanna let you down

I used to dream about cars and things
'Bout being a star and things
I thought that I would outgrow this feeling
It seems my dream won't go away

So it's more like a nightmare, keepin' me up all night
Like a nightmare, it's taking over my mind
My desire burns inside like a flame
And it can't and it won't be contained

'Cause I gotta be famous
I need to be somebody

Oh I won't stay another minute, you and me but now we're finished.
Gave my love but now I want it back.
You were the cause of so much sorrow, but you gon' be sad tomorrow.
Gave my love but boy you want it back.

Baby I. I. am so over you and it ain't take long to find somebody new.
He's everything I wanted and he's everything you wasn't and I know he'll never treat me like you do.
It's funny when I think about the past, when I was so naive to think that things would last. But now that I can see that you were never good for me, and it's over so you can give my love back. Help somebody!

Give me my Love back love back my love back love back.
You think I'm staying but I won't,
Just give me my love back love back my love back love back.
You think I love you but I don't!

Don't know
If you feel the same
So I keep
My thoughts hidden
We both agreed
To be friends
But emotions have risen
Wish you
Would give a sign
That you know
How i'm feeling
But until then
I'll cry silent tears
(I'l cry silent tears)
Oh, but until
Then I'll cry silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears)
Oh, oh
But until
Then I'll cry silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears)

Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life with out you
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you

Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you

Was beautiful

Can't stop smiling,
And I feel like crying,

And we all looking for something,
Tears flow with no end,
But then he makes me smile again,
My Joy,
My Pain,
But I Wouldn't Trade It For Nothing,

Yeah my hair and my ass fake, but so what?
I get my rent paid with it and my tits get me trips
To places I can't pronounce right
He said he'd keep it coming if I keep my body tight
And them bitches stay mad cause I'm living the life
'Cause I'm living the life, oh
Most people think I'm shallow
'Cause I'm always dressed like I'm going out to the club
But I gotta keep up cause it's new chicks poppin' up everyday
And they want the same thang

So I never leave the house without makeup on
I keep mascara in my pocket if I'm running to the market
'Cause you never know who's watching you
So I got to stay on, I got to stay on
I got to stay on, I got to stay on
Said I got to stay on

No, I ain't got a job, but so what?
I don't need it when I'm getting everything that I want
And everything that I ask for
