I see lovers hand in hand
Reminds me of the way it used to be (reminds me of the way it used to be boy)
Baby it felt so right

The clock at work says, "Three"
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

Baby, so you’ll be alright

Every mornin’ I think of you
I just can’t shake of my dreams, no, no

Are things that sweep a girl away

From what I've seen I doubt you can

Don't tell me that you love me

Try to find a number always in the book
Before you come up to me to tell me how you feel
I'm wiser than my years, so let me tell you what's the deal

What I really want to know
Is can you dance

Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Baby, tell me can you dance

I just wanna party, that's what I'm here to do
I didn't come through to pick up by the likes of you
I'll give you a chance and one is all you get
If you think I'm sassy now, boy, you ain't seen nothin' yet

All the boys
Want to know my name
When I don't tell them
They get upset
Breakin' hearts
Ain't my claim to fame
And if I had a dime for all they tried
I'd be a millionaire yet
When I'm out
Hangin' with my friends
People say we think we're cute
When we're together
Yeah, we play to win
And if you're gonna stare
What do we care
So what's it mean to you

Haven't I seen your face before
In some crowded place
Or maybe out at a movie

Too familiar to ignore
But I can't fill the space
Of where we met
Or how we could be

Maybe it was at the park
At a dance after dark
Or through a friend in the neighborhood

Wherever it may have been
I'm thinking as a friend
Cause I really do think that I know you

Do I know you
Is it possible
Do I know you
(Wondering do I know)

Do I know you
Is it possible
Do I know you

I know that I've seen your face before
In some crowded place
Or maybe I'm just dreaming

You're the one I've been looking for
And it's been all my life
And it feel so right
I'm so sure

In love with me
Why do you
Pretend to be

Of my faith in you
Trying to be

Me to
Still it seems
It's all just a game
To you

Somethin' about the way you make me feel
Lets me know that I can do without it
Lets me know that love is oh so real

I love the way you love me
I love the way you do
I love the way you love me
And for always, my love, it's forever true

Life is a breeze, the sun is always shinin'
Nothin' is wrong whenever you're around
Whatever I do there's something there remindin'
Of the beautiful friend in you that I found

Wanna break out from these walls
Catch a bus and take a walk downtown
Maybe run into a friend

So I decided to keep my cool, don't wanna cause a scene
But you're out here on a mission to be in my position

Girl, I know you need a man, I could never understand
Why would you play yourself makin' it easier for any man
To wanna take you home, make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leavin' me, you need to forget it go and find yourself a man

Tell me you why'd you wanna be the one he'd have to creep to see
You know that he's here with me, so tell me what's your intention
I've never been the jealous type and I won't be the fool tonight

And makes me feel like a woman should, oh, yeah

When I close my eyes I break down and cry
It's somethin' 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss, my heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me

Never thought that I would find, so much peace of mind
In every moment that I share with you
Some sometimes I don't know why we fell so deep in love
But then it all comes back to me because

Last night we made love, you called my name
And the next morning things weren't the same
Even though you stole my pride, I just can't understand why?
My heart and my mind and my soul still loves you

And I wanna hear you say that you love me
I wanna hear you say you care for me
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me
That's the way it's supposed to be

And deep inside I know I can't let go
But there's one thing I got to know
Will you be there for me?
Like the way it's supposed to be

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this don't feel right
How could you break my heart and leave this good woman?
See I can't stand the pain after all the love I gave
You took it, smiled and walked away oh baby

Three days passed and there were no phone calls
I was starting to get this feeling you weren't feeling me at all

Don't care if this journey takes all night
Oh, how my heart yearns to be with you

I thought, I would share with you my dreams
I'm still missing you
But instead of just writing you
I'll spread my wings and

Fly like an angel to you
I'll spread my wings like an eagle
And fly straight to you

I'm gon' fly like an angel to you
I won't be writing you no letters
Loves gon' bring our souls together

And if by chance that we should meet
On an open glide, we'll run away with each other
No looking back we're headed to our destiny
Someday I hope it will come true
(Someday will come true and I)

There's a right or wrong to know for everything
And the truth is somewhere written in between
But there's always something missing in the dark
There you find the true condition of the heart

Well, I can visualize the pieces of a dream
And it's not as far away as it may seem
But if truth be told, it's you that holds the key
To the question that defines my destiny

I've been in love a time or two
I've seen the world but not with you
I wanna fly and spread my wings
Don't wanna cry, I wanna sing

I wanna live and take a chance
I'm not afraid to love again
I wanna fall, fall for you
And I want you to fall for me too
Me too, me too

Can get caught up in their imagination

And their mind take over and having them actually think

What is an illusion is reality
But I'm here to set the record straight honey
Girl, ain't no woman gonna stay claim on my property
When they couldn't afford in the first place

Oh girl, I can't help that I have a man so fine
I can tell you one thing
He ain't thinking about your type[Incomprehensible]

And I know you wish you had
But you missed out on that train
I ain't have said it all sweet
I'm just trying to explain

That you can't go around and try mess up a happy home
You need to find a man of your own game
Leave my man alone
This reminds me

This reminds me of things in the movies
When the story is made up in your head
Like fatal attraction inefficient and misery
I know about your history
Girl you got it wrong

All my life I remember I was told
That I need a man to make me whole
I believed that I couldn't be a woman alone
So I searched everyday for someone who
Could give me happiness and truth
Didn't realize that I was living confused

It's OK
That empty space
Has been erased
(Now I can truly smile)
No more lies
They're gone goodbye
I'm satisfied
(Now I can stand on my own)

I'll never let another tell me that I can't be
Happy by myself with only me me me
Can't help that I'm excited

I remember when i was a little girl
A hersheys kiss was my favorite thing in the world
When i was lost i always turned to something sweet
A candy bar would always satisfy me instantly[uh huh] and

[Chorus:]
Your my chocolate, your my chocolate
Caramel, creamy filled, 100% filled chocolate your my chocolate,
Cocoa butter honey lover your like no other
Your my chocolate, your my chocolate like hot fudge your too much
I cant get enough of your chocolate,
Your chocolate you are my favorite candy

I used to imagine that you stayed 
And that I was able to touch your face 
I can remember how I cried 
Wishing you were with me 
I used to wonder about your day 
And if I was present in some way 
I needed to feel like I was loved 
I needed you desperately 

But I'm thankful, I'm grateful 
And you will always be to me 

Forever like a rose 
One so beautiful 
A symbol of love that I can hold 
Your petals shower me 
And I can feel your presence all around me 
Forever like a rose 
You're so incredible 
I can feel it still so powerful 
I finally believe 
That I can have your presence all around me 

I never was able to understand

Ahhh oh ooh oohh oooh oh .oh.yeah.
Standing in the crowded room
All on my own
I just wanna walk away
I cried so many tears at night
I got to stay
trying to find my way
you can't have sunshine, without the rain
So you just have to deal with the pain
"It just another lonely day"
(Another lonely day)
"In California"
(In california)
"It's just another lonely day"
(Another lonely day
In California
What am I doing to myself
Got to get out of my head
Don't like the way I am acting
Get rid of my distractions
