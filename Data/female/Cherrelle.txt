You know, everyone looks for pleasure
And a woman enjoys pleasure
As much as a man
But sometimes it's harder
For women to find pleasure
Or to be satisfied

Will you satisfy?
Will you satisfy?

In the quick of the night
A woman's feeling right
When she needs a man to call her own
Candlelight and sweet perfume
And lust is in the room
But she needs someone to share it with
Ooh, here he comes
With a sexy twinkle in his eyes
Tell me the truth
Lies just make me empty

If I let you take me home
Will you satisfy?
Will you be the man I can call my own?
Will you be the man of my dreams

All these years, you and I
Living in paradise
From so deep insight
Little voices cannot hide anymore
Dirty shirts and roses lay on the floor
You gave me everything that a grown up needs
And I was just a little girl
I could live and teach you
Everything that I knew
I lived inside your world
I never even noticed how much I fell so lonely

Never in my life have I just let go
Standing up and speaking my mind
Can't believe I'm many things
I never made sure
Never in my life did it matter to me
I'm never worth a fight cause I never felt free
Never in my life
Never in my life

Sitting here looking out my window
Waiting for the phone to ring, you see
I, I close my eyes thinking 'bout
The times we shared together
Oh, how I love to do it again

You see, I don't wanna waste my time
If you're not serious
(If you're not serious)
Oh, no (Oh, no)
Oh, no
And I don't wanna waste your time
If you're lucky to find
A temporary lover

'Cause I don't need
A Friday night lover
Part-time lover

Never knew that I was living a lie
So when you came back to me
You have made me see
So don't be surprised
If you see me crying

Tears of joy roll down like rain
Set my emotions free (free, free)
Tears of joy wash away my pain (hey, hey)

Never gonna let you go away

Every woman wants a man who's beautiful

Hey, tune!
Can I get a little more vibe?

One, two, three, whoo!

Keep my heart open to love someone
Anytime they're let in, it always ends up broken
So I've learned to think of love as fun
Never take it serious, never get too close

But then you take me in your arms, it's all right again
And all my troubles seem to fly out the window
That's what I seek from you (Seek from you)
Because I'm weak for you
Make me strong if it takes all night
If it's wrong then why's it feel so right?

What more can I do for you?
You give me everything I need, yeah
No, what more can I do for you
For all that you've done for me?

Tell the truth rather than live a lie
I just started feeling this critical condition
So why not kick it with another guy?
He doesn't make me happy, so why should I feel guilty?

But then you take me in your arms, it's all right again
And all my troubles seem to fly out the window

Lately when I'm with you, you seem so far away
Rumor has it, you're gone astray
There's talk all over town, you've found somebody new
I know sometimes it's hard for you
Making me promises you know that you can't keep
You're even talking in your sleep
I know it's crazy what we're going through
But fooling around is crazy too

Is it yes or no?
Should I stay or go?
Stop fooling around, boy
Is it yes or no?
Should I stay or go?
Stop fooling around, boy

You're feeling what's inside of me wondering what to say
Here we are face to face
Do you wanna settle down or just keep fooling around
Spreading your love all over town?
And it's not very often that I complain to you
But lately, baby, you've been too loose

You know, everyone looks for pleasure
And a woman enjoys pleasure
As much as a man
But sometimes it's harder
For women to find pleasure
Or to be satisfied

Will you satisfy?
Will you satisfy?

In the quick of the night
A woman's feeling right
When she needs a man to call her own
Candlelight and sweet perfume
And lust is in the room
But she needs someone to share it with
Ooh, here he comes
With a sexy twinkle in his eyes
Tell me the truth
Lies just make me empty

If I let you take me home
Will you satisfy?
Will you be the man I can call my own?
Will you be the man of my dreams
...

You are my favorite lady
And you are my favorite man, yes, you are
(I know)
So it feels good to know
That you feel the same

And forever and a day
Together we will be
Nothing on this Earth could ever
Take you away from me

'Cause I've been kissed but I
(Never knew love like this)
And I've been missed but I
(Never knew love like this)

Loved someone before but I
(Never knew love like this)
I've had lots of lovin' but I
Never knew love like this

You're something special
And you know you're something special too
I love you and that's all I need to hear
 (I love you too)
To make my day

'Cause you're always on my mind
No matter what I do
Nothing on this Earth could ever
Keep me away from you

I've been kissed but I
(Never knew love like this)

Hey, tune!
Can I get a little more vibe?

One, two, three, whoo!

Keep my heart open to love someone
Anytime they're let in, it always ends up broken
So I've learned to think of love as fun
Never take it serious, never get too close

But then you take me in your arms, it's all right again
And all my troubles seem to fly out the window
That's what I seek from you (Seek from you)
Because I'm weak for you
Make me strong if it takes all night
If it's wrong then why's it feel so right?

What more can I do for you?
You give me everything I need, yeah
No, what more can I do for you
For all that you've done for me?

Tell the truth rather than live a lie
I just started feeling this critical condition
So why not kick it with another guy?
He doesn't make me happy, so why should I feel guilty?

Not to boast but does an awful lot

Let me give some reasons

You gave me everything that a grown up needs
And I was just a little girl
I could live and teach you
Everything that I knew
I lived inside your world
I never even noticed how much I fell so lonely

Never in my life have I just let go
Standing up and speaking my mind
Can't believe I'm many things

You have made me see
So don't be surprised
If you see me crying

Tears of joy roll down like rain
Set my emotions free (free, free)

I'll never forget the love we shared
And I never lose the love I have for you
You can see it when you look in my eyes

Oh, oh...

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

Listen

When you look in my eyes
What do you see?
Am I still the same person
That I used to be

Even though I was still your favorite girl
That doesn't mean I shouldn't feel
The same way I used to feel

When you look in my eyes
What do you see? (Aah...)
Am I still the same person
That I used to be? (Aah.)

Oh, me
You know, I never meant for this to happen
But if it's wrong, I just feel so right

You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs
All rare but sensitive
Everything I miss at home

You know how to hold me
And feel all the things, I want to feel
Inside of each tender kiss
I get everything I miss at home

I was just out on the town in search of some fun
I was looking for love

I don't need a man to tell me how to feel
Affair, I don't want a promise
All I really need is to be close to you

I want respect and I'll state my case
'Cause, baby, I won't take
All your loveliness in my face

So hear me loud and clear

Till the day when you said goodbye

Man in my life, you made everything right
I held back my emotions
Never knew that I was living a lie
So when you came back to me
You have made me see
So don't be surprised
If you see me crying

Tears of joy roll down like rain
Set my emotions free (free, free)
Tears of joy wash away my pain (hey, hey)
Since you came back to me
Ooh, yeah

Now you're here beside me
Never gonna let you go away
Without you here to guide me

My friends were going out, they said, you rarely go
That's how I got him to really knock me dead
Looked him in the eyes and quickly said

You look good to me
When you walk I just lose all my control
You look good to me
And when you talk I just want to kiss your big mouth, baby

I want you to know you look good to me
So I [Incomprehensible] you, baby, uh, baby, uh, baby

And I'll give you all I have to offer
Not to boast but does an awful lot

No one's gonna kiss you like I will
No one's gonna treat you like I will
Nobody's gonna make you feel like I will

Let me give some reasons

For women to find pleasure
Or to be satisfied

Will you satisfy?

When she needs a man to call her own

And lust is in the room
But she needs someone to share it with
Ooh, here he comes
With a sexy twinkle in his eyes

Lies just make me empty

But when I did, I wasn't trying to lead you on.
Now you bring me home and tell me "good night's not enough for you".
I'm sorry, baby, I didn't mean to turn you on.
You read me wrong.
I wasn't trying to lead you on not like you did.
I didn't mean to turn you on.
You read me wrong. (You read me wrong.)
I wasn't trying to lead you on.
I want a friend.
I didn't mean to turn you on.
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on.

I know you expecting a one-night stand.
When I refused, I knew you wouldn't understand.
I told you twice, I was only trying to be nice.
Only trying to be nice. Oh.
I didn't mean to turn you on.
You read me wrong.
I wasn't trying to lead you on not like you did.
I didn't mean to turn you on.
You read (You read.) me wrong.

Baby, won't you stay with me
A little longer
Won't you hold me tight
For another night
Baby, please
Baby, won't you stay with me
A little longer
Try to make it right
For another night
Baby, please

I can't let you go, I'm not ready
Don't you close the door, mmm
Let me love you more 'cause I'm ready
Don't you leave me behind

Baby, won't you stay with me
A little longer
Won't you hold me tight
For another night
Baby, please
Baby, won't you stay with me
A little longer
Try to make it right

You look good to me, you look good to me

Oh, I found him 'bout a week ago
My friends were going out, they said, you rarely go
That's how I got him to really knock me dead
Looked him in the eyes and quickly said

You look good to me
When you walk I just lose all my control
You look good to me
And when you talk I just want to kiss your big mouth, baby

I want you to know you look good to me
So I [Incomprehensible] you, baby, uh, baby, uh, baby
Never ever been a forward girl, I just speak my mind
Being honest never felt so good or looked so fine

Lookin' good isn't everything
And personality won't make emotion a thing
The combination is what love's about
I'm not in love but I have no doubt

It's been a long time
I didn't think I was
Going to see you again

See you haven't changed
It's good to see you anyway

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain

When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You'll stay on my mind

Always so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other
(All the good I won't forget)
You will stay on my mind
(Saturday, the day we met)

For always and for ever
You will be my Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

Where do I run to?
Why must I cry?
The love that we had was
Meant forever

Where do I run to?
Why must I cry?
The love that we had was
Meant forever

Where do I run to?
Why must I cry?
All the love we made, baby
(Was so) So good
(I know) I know
(Come back to me)
That's all I really need
(Baby) Oh, baby
'Cause all my love is for you, baby

You know, everyone looks for pleasure
And a woman enjoys pleasure
As much as a man
But sometimes it's harder
For women to find pleasure
Or to be satisfied

Will you satisfy?
Will you satisfy?

In the quick of the night
A woman's feeling right
When she needs a man to call her own
Candlelight and sweet perfume
And lust is in the room
But she needs someone to share it with
Ooh, here he comes
With a sexy twinkle in his eyes
Tell me the truth
Lies just make me empty

If I let you take me home
Will you satisfy?
Will you be the man I can call my own?
Will you be the man of my dreams
...

Oh, me
You know, I never meant for this to happen
But if it's wrong, I just feel so right
You give me attention

You're someone who understands my needs
A man who is sensitive
Everything I miss at home
You know how to hold me
And do all the things, I want to feel
Inside of each tender kiss
I get everything I miss at home

I was just out on the town in search of some fun

Verse I

Felt Hurt so many times.
But, i kepted it al inside my self...
Thought this... would be the same.
But, now i'm feeling something else.
(cherelle)
My friend tell me., that i'll get over you.
But, now i feel like such a fool.

But, now it's here...

Ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh...
Ooh-ooh...

I never knew about lonely
Till the day when you said goodbye
I knew you were the only
Man in my life, you made everything right
I held back my emotions
Never knew that I was living a lie
So when you came back to me
You have made me see
So don't be surprised
If you see me crying

Tears of joy roll down like rain
Set my emotions free (free, free)
Tears of joy wash away my pain (hey, hey)
Since you came back to me
Ooh, yeah

Now you're here beside me
Never gonna let you go away
Without you here to guide me

Ohh
Ohh
A gentle touch
It means so much
Attention when I need it
Is what keeps my love
I'm looking for that kind of man
Who'll treat me right
With tender love and care
To give me every night
(Every night)
F-R-A-G-I-L-E
I'm fragile
Better lick it hard
It's hard to handle
So handle with care
My love is fragile
Better lick it hard
It's hard to handle
So handle with care
My love is fragile
Your soft caress
And tenderness
I depend on having
These things

(feat. Keith Murray)

Yo', this is funky
Stevie J (Yeah) this is funky (Word)
Cherrelle, come on

Keith kicks the rhyme at the right time
In a black jeep with Cherrelle in the driver's seat
Socializin', dip-dip divin'
Noddin' to a phat Stevie J beat
Master of disaster, you came to me
We treat the Benz just like a hooptie
We bring noise and the funk with the chalk and the skunk
With the double pump in the trunk
Learn a lesson, we make it hot
I'm not a player hater, yo', I just dis a lot
Cherrelle

What am I to say what I gotta do
To let you know my heart is calling out for you
Gotta find the right time
Can't deny that I need you in my life

Been knowing you for awhile now
Always said I had to have you somehow
I'm just a woman who knows what she needs
If you're down, come take a chance with me, ho, ho...

What am I to say (Say) what I gotta do (Do)
To let you know my heart is calling out for you (Oh)
Gotta find (Gotta find ) the right time (Right time)
