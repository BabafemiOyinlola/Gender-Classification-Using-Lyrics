I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguin
From the time I picked you up
Until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's his fault again' is what you telling all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya doing, I know they stressin on ya
I know them times going hard, thats why I'm checkin on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl, I can do it better for ya, cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever

Won't you come on and go with me ooh girl,
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a sit
And let me ease ya mind girl
We gon' do it our way

I heard your friend told a friend that told a friend of mine

Oh, that long? How the hell'd he get time like that
Three strikes with posession, aw, he ain't comin' back
He left you with two kids and bills all around
Plus you found out he had another chick 'cross town

It's always the darkest, ah-right before the sunrisin'
And you gotta stay strong, for the kids in they eyes and
And please don't despise, and go against all brothers
And have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
I hate to sound Tupac-ish lil' mama, but keep ya head up
But you gon' make it, I promise, you keep your head up
And that that don't kill you only makes you stronger
And the will to succeed'll only feed the hunger, f'real, f'real, f'real

HOT SHIT!

Mmmmmm

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
and it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (what?)
I'm from the Lou and I'm proud
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics ‘til the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)

Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on

I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

And I'll be right back, yeah that's my very next line

Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man

Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats - total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compurr this - my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range.
You're out of your brains, thinkin' I'ma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin' it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin' bitchin and cryin' - suck it up as a loss
Cause your, act is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

I am number one - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it

Yo, we 'bout to start a epidemic wit dis one

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty mo at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on da rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say, I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changin' grillz everyday, like Jay change clothes

I might be grilled out nicely in my white tee
On South beach in my wife beat, VV and studded
You can tell when they cut it, ya, see my grandmama hate it
But my lil' mama love it 'cuz when I open up ya mouth
Ya grill gleamin', say what? Eyes stay low from da cheifin'

En la misma primaria, comparte la misma parada de autobús
Incluso cuando era joven yo sabía que era tan mosca
Incluso entonces yo sabía que usted era el

Derecho a través de la escuela a su ocupación actual
Le tomó tanto tiempo para mí al hombre y tener esta conversación
Pero joder, aquí van

Chica que necesito saber que puedo ser su primera y única
Te necesito, que me necesitan
Vea usted mi niña peor error, y por eso
Es difícil mantener la calma cuando te veo con él
Porque yo realmente deseo que se haya aquí
Dime lo que se necesita para ganar sólo un - pedazo de su corazón
Mi kriptonita sólo es usted, es por eso que todo lo que diga que voy a hacer
Permítanme detenerme un minuto, tomar un segundo para decir

Yo... we cool, right?
Nah I mean, we go back
You know, back before the records
Before you went to college and became this person who you are
Oh, congratulations on that anyway too, so
But, for a long time it's been somethin I need to tell you
Uhh, uhh, uhh - listen

You see we been knowin each other since we were about this high
Same elementary, shared the same bus stop
Even as a youngster I knew you was so fly
Even back then I knew you were the one
I watched you grow, I watched your transformation
Right through school to your current occupation
It took this long for me to man up and have this conversation
But fuck it, here it go

[Chorus: Nelly]

Girl I need to know that, I can be your one and only

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want u with no other man
Why can't u understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped u off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again

See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya

Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause

I done said that shit calm, I done said that shit loud

Robbed a jewelry store and tell â€ em make me a grill
Yeah da whole top diamonds and da bottom row's gold
Yo, we â€ bout to start an epidemic wit dis one
Y'all know what dis is, so so def

Got 30 down at da bottom, 30 mo' at da top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If they could call it a drink, call it a smile on da rocks
If they could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot

I got like platinum and white golds, traditional gold
I'm changin' grillz e'rday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely in my white tee
On South Beach in my wife b

Vive ustedes, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it
But my lil' mama love it, â€ cuz when I

Open up ya mouth ya grill gleamin'
Eyes stay low from da chiefin'

I got a grill I call â€ penny candy', you know what dat mean?
It look like Now an' Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it fo' nutin, only a crazy man would
So if ya catch me in ya city, somewhere out in ya hood

Want to see if you still got that look in your eyes
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we got to spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same things
Over and over again

What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' a sportscar, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, and do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flipped it, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cuz baby I can't talk it

Hmm, I'm goin' down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
(C'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I'm goin' down, down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs

And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector
(Hot shit!)

So feel me when I bring it, sing it loud
(What?)
I'm from the Loop and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause

I'm righteous above the law, Playa my style's raw
I'm 'Born to Mack' like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer

My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin' niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

She can be 18 (18) wit an attitude
or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Got 30 down at da bottom, 30 mo' at da top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks

If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot

She hintin' around at gettin' ate out
I know I'm spaced out, but the shit sound way out
So I had to take a playa out, switch up my whurrabouts
'Cause she was tryin' to turn a playa out
And plus she know a nigga blazed out
And lil' mama gon' crack a window, let the haze out

She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Gotta make, sure, I don't get attached

But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering?
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing

From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's all his fault again that's what you tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again

See how ya day going I know they stressin' on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for ya, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me, oh girl?
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl?
We gon' do it our way, our way

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time

We never had a problem with gettin' it done

Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?

They like to work out, and I ain't talkin' Tae-Bo

That's thirty different teachers over ten thousand different peers
And I done fought nearly everyone, been suspended every time
Besides a few were felony and commited dirty crimes

But never braggin' no, I just want you to see me where I have been
I never proud of it so I don't have to go back there again
And I used to go like house to house sleepin' on couch to couch
Walk around sticking out my hands, looking for a hand out

Only thing got handed out was more bills
Only thing that pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills

Ain't for that our or go and beat the block
Ain't no way you can heat the cops
Ain't no way I could beat the clock
Just a matter of time, shut down your shop

You stay up day and nights, livin' this way of life

No more of that sittin', man, sittin' and waitin' and thinkin'

Doubles get you from that bar, and get you right
Or get you bent, whatever you like

I'm not into wifin', no sir
I just wanna beat it up, hear the kitty-cat purr
The whip or the tail, whichever you prefer
The crib off limits, got wifey durr

Got a man home beast, then be easy ma
She don't know how to creep, I be teachin' ma
I got jars of that haze, yeah, I'll show you how to twist
Get it tight but not too tight, it's all in the lick

I'll show you which end to burn, how to spot that trick
All you need is the will to learn
And some good trees to burn
Relax, you'll be straight like a perm, word

Free city, this is a shout out to every young brother ya know
That's doin' his bid right now, keep ya head up
He's walkin' the yard, wishin' he had wings like this
You know fly up out that joint, man

If I could, fly away, ooh bet I wouldn't come back
No more, I, I'd turn around
Just to see you for the last time

See, now I know, hey, that it won't be easy
I done fought in a battle and I done made it this far
I gotta few more feet but it's still 'The Longest Yard'

Man, it's 'The Longest Yard' I ever had to get in my life
And see my life ain't right, if my wife don't write
My nigga can't eat if the fish don't bite
My raise the gross sales, like Mike did Nike

I'm big brother almighty
I keep a gamma ray, I'ma G-5 G
Take a G-5 jeep, G-5 deep
Too some of their bare feet
And a G don't speak

Listen mayne, they lock it down round here
See body bagged and gagged and your found round here
This as serious as it sound round here
The guards guard the ground, 4 pounds round here

And they ain't playin', they're just lettin' you know
That anything they want to happen, nigga, happen real slow
Get the word from upstairs that you're in that hole
I cant take it, I'm just ready to go

If I could, fly away, ooh and I wouldn't come back

But now it's flipped and I don't want u with no other man
Why can't u understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped u off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again

I aint pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Come on ova to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl

[** feat. T.I.:]


[Chorus:]
Me and you go hand to hand*
And I don't give a damn
I'll always be your man
It's something about you smilin'
That lights my life
I need you by my side
I need you in my life
As long as me and you keep doing
What we're doin'
'Cause I know it's right
'Cause I know what we ask won't take us to our lives

Are we meeting again?
When that young man was kid and a wimp
We'll I'm just... you the beat until it ends
'Cause I'm so damn hot
Like the heat when I win
I'm speaking to him like I'm speaking to him
So little wimp no fucking beat for your swim
Yes, I'm keeping all the little shuck up
I'm just like the algebra course that you took up
I'm smooth like a...
I floss like a new truck
So you all gonna get chewed up

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah, it was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream

I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road

Yeah, this time I'll make my move, this time I'll show improve
To prove that I'm really irreplaceable

Plus I don't know if she's ever been told
But I got whatever she needs, yeah

No-one could ever take what we've got right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you could be my lover
And if its in love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby

You'll be here, through it all
I'll do it again if I have to
Throw this money at you

Girl you know you got me gone

Yea I just rock cause I fuck with puff
I pop that ace of spade cause I rock with jay
I'm on that cali good but I'm not in l.a
I'm somewhere halfway between there and the bay
I like them broosy bras I like round the way
I take them outta they js put them in hermays
Might hang out in the club might chill out somewhere safer
King gold and office macks I love to hang with paper
My crib is plush plush I'm talking elevator
So don't touch touch don't feed the alligator
You fly right my fly is greater
Multiply the money and the bitches subtract the haters
She said
I don't want no broke niggas no no
I don't want no broke niggas no no
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
In vegas l.a. and miami oh yea I like shoppin
If you can handle all of that then we can get it poppin

Pull up to the club like a pimpsy
Shouts out to the players in the VIP
Hey DJ, yeah you remember me
It's the nigga with same proof from outta suit
And we be, we be

Poppin' bottles, making noise
On the tables, on the bars
And at every bar
Tell them girls to freak them boys

It's like no matter what I try to do I just can't make her happy
See every other day it's like she throwin' new shit at me
A constant petty complain' 'bout every single thang
Hard to swagger maintain, shorty drivin' me insane

In the beginnin' I'll admit it, if you said it I was on it
And even if I felt you did me wrong, girl, I was copin'
I guess a nigga was hopin', thinkin' 'bout elopin'
See I just call it focused but some might call it open

Yeah, it's like I'm compromisin' everythin' I stood fo'
I'm breakin' rules that every nigga in the hood know
One, weigh it yourself, two, never play yourself
Three, it don't matter, girl
I'll throw 'em out the window 'cause for you

I, I-I'll bend over backwards
I'll, do anythin' you say
I, I-I'm here for you, baby

On the floor, in the chair, under covers

The wrong side to be*
I feel empty,
Try to call me on the phone, call me on tonight,
Tell me that she'll never let me go,
She worries all the time,
I'm gonna be giving her the grind,
Giving her the grind,
I'm properly dealing with a body, so...

I just got a late text, stopping you the late text,
Practicing on your safe sex world.
Cause...
Please believe that the minute that I see that girl,
... and I can't really wait so long.
Text messages and e-mails,
Leaving little voice mails,
She shouldn't ring my phone.
I say, come over!
Come over!

Shorty bring in the...
Hang up the phone, open the door!

Call me on the phone; call me on tonight,
Tell me that you'll never let me go,

Hmm, I'm goin' down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
(C'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I'm goin' down, down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs

And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector
(Hot shit!)

So feel me when I bring it, sing it loud
(What?)
I'm from the Loop and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause

I'm righteous above the law, Playa my style's raw
I'm 'Born to Mack' like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer

My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin' niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

You're out of your brains, thinkin' I'ma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin' it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin' bitchin and cryin' - suck it up as a loss

Two hundred thou, couldn't get you in the league
Get three hundred thou, you couldn't even buy the keys

Now, shall I proceed?

Spread your wings, if you real ma, fly real low
Pause for a second ma, grind real slow

Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold
Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def
Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top
All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
Vvs studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say
Smile for me daddy
(What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill
(Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)
Smile for me daddy

I want to see your grill

Yo, we cool right?
I mean we go back, you know, back before the records, before you went to college and become this person who you are,
Congratulations on that anyway to,
But for long time it's been something I need to tell you,
Listen

You see we've been known each other since we were about this high,
Same elementary, shared the same bus stop,
Even as a youngster I knew your so fly,
Even back then I knowed you were the one,
I watched you grow, I watched your transformation,
Right to school to your coll and occupation,
It took this long to be a man to have this conversation,
But fuck it here we go

I want you
To want me
Girl I need to know that
I could be your one and only
I need you,
To need me,
See you were my worst mistake girl,
And that's why
It's hard to keep my cool when I see you with him,
Cause I really wish that you would right here,
Tell me what should take to win just a piece of your heart
My only cryptonite is you
That's why anything you'll say I'll do,
So let me stop for a minute take a sec to say
Girl you take my breath away
Away, girl you take my breath away
You take my breath away, you take my breath away

They say one's man trash is the next man's treasure,
Or one I find pain and next time I find pleasure,
I wont pay attention to the haters now or never,

But now it's flipped and I don't want u with no other man
Why can't u understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped u off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
"it's all his fault again" that's what u telling all ya friends
I aint pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me
Come on ova to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat

Errebody lookin' if you're jealous turn around
21 inches keep me further from the ground
I'm gettin good grip from the Dunlop Tires
The F1's bumpin' but I need the volume higher
Cause there ain't no way get on the basement beat hits
J.E. and Wally got an wanna get some
I heard them haters talkin' but what am I to do?
I'm the men that little hate the Bill Clinton of the Lou'

Picked up some shorties on Skinker towards roastin'
Headed for the castlelot muskada got me croachin
Bently kinda crowded ol car was leanin' back

Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Girl, you lookin' so fly, do, do, do
Said I wanna get it on, do, do, do
Girl, you lookin' so fly, do, do, do
Said, I wanna get it on

Now you could search the whole globe but couldn't replace me
You skurred to face me, you don't wanna race me
Fendi fur, Cartier glasses for the blur
I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her

I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, "Ahh man" when they see me with Cardin
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan

I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order

So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take
Plus she been on my nuts since thumps and pencil breaks
'Cause I'm a nigga with the hoe, a nigga with the flow
Fo' Reel nigga, pissy drunk in the Rov'

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight

Baby girl, you hear me callin' you?
Now I ain't hawkin' you, just wanna walk with you
Talk with you for a second, spit a little somethin' in that err

Let your waist pop when the bass knock

Can't even tell the time, but you know it's mine
What time is it ma? It's twenty karats after nine

Dust your shoes off before you touch that flo'

'Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug

You can even wait 'til the mountain comes down
And if you wanna wait 'til the river runs dry
But you'll never find another one
You can search around the whole damn globe
Search from in the North, to the East, Westside

No matter what you do, you'll never find another one

Hey yo this chronic got me to', I try to shake it and break it
Thinkin it won't go, I went to see the doctor
X-rays it won't show, I even wrapped myself up in blankets
Just like a cold cause I'm so sick-wid-it
It just happened on a song, I feel it in my eyes
My urrs and in my nose, my fingers and my toes
Translated into flows, man rap gon' need a facelift
I'm just so hungry I can taste it
Imagine me up in the sto', somewhere behind the counter
pushin buttons on the drawer, like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Chk-chicka, here you go, please come another day
I waited a lot of winter days and summer nights to rock the mic
City locked down, right before me and the other 'Tics went down
You fuckin right it went down
Fuckin right I drink Crown, fuckin right we move crowds

Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs

And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch

And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'

Run a mile for the cause

On South Beach in my wife b
Vive ustedes, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it
But my lil' mama love it, cuz when I
Open up ya mouth ya grill gleamin'
Eyes stay low from da chiefin'
I got a grill I call penny candy', you know what dat mean?

It look like Now an' Later, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it fo' nutin, only a crazy man would
So if ya catch me in ya city, somewhere out in ya hood

Just say
Smile fo' me daddy
(What you lookin' at?)
Let me see ya grill
(Let me see my what?)

Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

Let me lick you up and down
'Til you stay stop
Let me play with your body, baby
Make you real hot
Let me do all the things that a nigga wan' do
Tell me why
'Cause tonight, baby
I wanna get freaky with you

Uh, yeah
Pretty lady, nice to meet you
My name is Nelly and you're?
She said, "Baby, you don't need to
You know I know who you are"
Soon as you pulled up, I peeped you
Lace dress, all see through
Get to talkin' 'bout her boyfriend
Ain't tryna hear 'bout other people
Think she said he was a ball player
But all his plays under review
Foreplay, that's a preview
Round two, that's the sequel
Baby, I can keep a secret
He ain't gotta know what we do
We low as the ground
Call me when he ain't around

Hmm, I'm goin' down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
(C'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I'm goin' down, down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs

And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector
(Hot shit!)

So feel me when I bring it, sing it loud
(What?)
I'm from the Loop and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause

I'm righteous above the law, Playa my style's raw
I'm 'Born to Mack' like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer

My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin' niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

She can be 18 (18) wit an attitude
or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y

Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it

And it's a shame that we got to spend our time
Being mad about the same things

Got 30 down at da bottom, 30 mo' at da top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering?
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing

From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's all his fault again that's what you tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again

See how ya day going I know they stressin' on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for ya, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me, oh girl?
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl?
We gon' do it our way, our way

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time

We never had a problem with gettin' it done

But play it off, she won't know a damn thing

I play it off 'til it's played out
I had her motherfuckin' ass on the couch, honey laid out
She hintin' around at gettin' ate out
I know I'm spaced out, but the shit sound way out
So I had to take a playa out, switch up my whurrabouts
'Cause she was tryin' to turn a playa out
And plus she know a nigga blazed out
And lil' mama gon' crack a window, let the haze out

She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Gotta make, sure, I don't get attached

But it keeps, on, bringin' me back

Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?

I never proud of it so I don't have to go back there again
And I used to go like house to house sleepin' on couch to couch
Walk around sticking out my hands, looking for a hand out

Only thing got handed out was more bills
Only thing that pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills

Ain't for that our or go and beat the block
Ain't no way you can heat the cops
Ain't no way I could beat the clock

You stay up day and nights, livin' this way of life

You see I drive one now and drive the other one later
Shit, it's the new Fresh Prince and all I'm missing is Jada
I got a hard drive, all I'm missing is data
Please give my number to ya sister, I been missing to date her
I hate to hate a hater, in fact I hate to hate

Hatin' is hatin' you should never hate, congratulate
Look hurr, my attitude is just that you may never know my mind
Or know just what I'm thinkin' if I don't won't you inside
Yeah, inside my mental, I know you meant well
I'm out of time and out of 'Training Day' like Denzel
Never the gangsta type, more like a hustla
I fucked the ones up out them Playboy books and Hustler
Honeys and black tails, 'The King' magazines
The Maximas, the eye candy in Queens

Walk down the river 'cuz the river don't run
Same thing make you laugh, make you cry

And it hurts so bad, yeah

Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me

And it's a shame that we gotta spend our time
Bein' mad about the same things

But now it's flipped and I don't want u with no other man
Why can't u understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped u off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again

I aint pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Come on ova to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl

She hintin' around at gettin' ate out
I know I'm spaced out, but the shit sound way out
So I had to take a playa out, switch up my whurrabouts
'Cause she was tryin' to turn a playa out
And plus she know a nigga blazed out
And lil' mama gon' crack a window, let the haze out

She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do

Mmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs

And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector

So feel me when I bring it, sing it loud

I'm from the Loop and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause

I'm righteous above the law, Playa my style's raw
I'm 'Born to Mack' like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer

My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin' niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

And break it down low to the flo', and there you go

Somebody probably jealous, 'cause they (bitch) got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' (shit) like this

So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?

Hey hey guys, yeah yeah yeah

We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now, please rise for the singin' of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tah-ryin'
Just to get up that hill

I said but now we're up in the Big Leagues
My dirty, it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give me what you got thing
Hot wings, fuck a duck, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what

I put my mack down, she threw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, God livin' like a worst race

First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Hittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home

Third baseman just don't understand baby, what the bomb
What the fuck wrong with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed

Now you stays on yo knees
'Cause we's be in the Big League
'Cause we's be in the Big Leauge

All that pressure you applyin' it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off

Don't be lyin' bitchin and cryin' - suck it up as a loss

My hands is all in your hair
But I won't tell your man

You better not let go
Cause you ain't you even you ain't even close
Just wait till I get you out them clothes (out them clothes)
I'm a show what your body is for, I wanna know
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel good baby don't it feel good to you

Yea I just rock cause I fuck with puff
I pop that ace of spade cause I rock with jay
I'm on that cali good but I'm not in l.a
I'm somewhere halfway between there and the bay
I like them broosy bras I like round the way
I take them outta they js put them in hermays
Might hang out in the club might chill out somewhere safer
King gold and office macks I love to hang with paper
My crib is plush plush I'm talking elevator
So don't touch touch don't feed the alligator
You fly right my fly is greater
Multiply the money and the bitches subtract the haters
She said
I don't want no broke niggas no no
I don't want no broke niggas no no
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
If you ain't got no money then you can't do nothing for me
In vegas l.a. and miami oh yea I like shoppin
If you can handle all of that then we can get it poppin
I don't want no broke niggas no no
I want the type of nigga who know how to ball out
You don't no broke nigga I don't want no broke bitch

Shot gun with a twin in the backseat
No one with them two, it's just me
Pull up to the club like a pimpsy
Shouts out to the players in the VIP
Hey DJ, yeah you remember me
It's the nigga with same proof from outta suit
And we be, we be

Poppin' bottles, making noise
On the tables, on the bars
And at every bar
Tell them girls to freak them boys
I feel the patron jello shots
I'm throwing one hundred dollar rain drops
I live it up, yo, and they not, they not
Cause today

I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live tonight away

I talk a lil' Fred Seigal girl (Seigal, girl)
Bonnie and Judy Lee with your bag all beaded, girl
Apple bottom pair underneath it
You talkin like you don't need it
I can tell you see it
I like that in you
I don't see nothin wrong
Drop down and get your eagle on (Woah)

(1: Gipp)
Shorty Scripe Young Scripe
Even Gipp got 4
krispy kreme in the paint
chrome on the toes
Stoufers out the AC, 4-5 Doors
and i never leave the club less its 4-5...(That's right)
Money hungry hustlers,
real-estate investers,
Get the fuckin friend
like he'll never be a customer
Dougy fresh clean,

on the scene chokin' Irene
We don't do relationships
we'd rather have a Plain,
my jeans and my shoes worth
more than your green
40-thousand in the car
keep em closer at hand,
Watch the stone in my ear
make the hoes go "Dang!"
and the women love me
'cause they know who I am

HOT SHIT!

Mmmmmm

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
and it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (what?)
I'm from the Lou and I'm proud
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics ‘til the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)

Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

She can be 18 (18) wit an attitude
or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition, and khaki, and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four

And in no time I better make this friend mine and
That's for sure
Cause I-I never been the type to break up a happy

You gon' fuck around and show why the "Show Me" get called the "Show Me"
Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was hands
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats - total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compurr this - my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range.
You're out of your brains, thinkin' I'ma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin' it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin' bitchin and cryin' - suck it up as a loss
Cause your, act is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

I am number one - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it
I am number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey - now let me ask you man
What does it take to be number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (hey)
What does it take to be number one?

Antes de ir a la universidad y se convirtió en esa persona que usted está

Sin embargo, durante mucho tiempo ha sido algo que necesito decirte

Te necesito, que me necesitan
Vea usted mi niña peor error, y por eso
Es difícil mantener la calma cuando te veo con él
Porque yo realmente deseo que se haya aquí
Dime lo que se necesita para ganar sólo un - pedazo de su corazón
Mi kriptonita sólo es usted, es por eso que todo lo que diga que voy a hacer
Permítanme detenerme un minuto, tomar un segundo para decir
Girl you Take My Breath Away, awayyyy
Girl you Take My Breath Away (awayyyy)
You Take My Breath Away, you take my breath away, yeah

Yo, we cool right?
I mean we go back, you know, back before the records, before you went to college and become this person who you are,
Congratulations on that anyway to,
But for long time it's been something I need to tell you,
Listen

You see we've been known each other since we were about this high,
Same elementary, shared the same bus stop,
Even as a youngster I knew your so fly,
Even back then I knowed you were the one,
I watched you grow, I watched your transformation,
Right to school to your coll and occupation,
It took this long to be a man to have this conversation,
But fuck it here we go

I want you
To want me
Girl I need to know that
I could be your one and only
I need you,
To need me,
See you were my worst mistake girl,
And that's why
It's hard to keep my cool when I see you with him,
Cause I really wish that you would right here,
Tell me what should take to win just a piece of your heart
My only cryptonite is you
That's why anything you'll say I'll do,
So let me stop for a minute take a sec to say
Girl you take my breath away
Away, girl you take my breath away
You take my breath away, you take my breath away

They say one's man trash is the next man's treasure,
Or one I find pain and next time I find pleasure,
I wont pay attention to the haters now or never,

HOT SHIT!

Mmmmmm

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
and it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (what?)
I'm from the Lou and I'm proud
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics ‘til the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

She can be 18 (18) wit an attitude
or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition, and khaki, and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man

Why can't u understand anything I'm offering

From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped u off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again

I aint pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya

Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Come on ova to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat

Ice buckets nigga for the gold Ace
Big cash duffle bag with the gold lace
Heard a nigga say throw in the towel
Numbers speak the truth these niggas out here in denial.

I am so faded, 10, 000 square feet gated
100k tomorrow, money in the bag

There’s no place I won’t go
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I’ll never find another you, baby
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful (leggo)

Been around, been around the world
Lookin for you
Seen so many, many pretty girls
Left it on ya
Been to Tokyo with no luck
I left France with no luck
Found nobody in Toronto like you uh uh

(Pre-)
Seen a million pretty faces
Still ain’t found one like yours
With a walk mean as yours,
New shades, clothes Victor
I’ve been a million different places,
Still ain’t found one like you
It’s the little things you do
That make you so beautiful

And there’s no place I won’t go (where I won’t go)
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world

Switching up your hair, got your freak em dress on,
Afraid that you were fresh, like you about to perform
And I'ma . mess I had you on my own
Wake up he was gone, I can't even blame you
Now you in the arms of a stranger,
And now I'm all alone with the same girl,

Such a worry wind, I want my girlfriend
Party on ten, I can't even pretend

Looking for a brighter day, a brighter day

And if we don't know when we're in a race
And pout a big smile on out mama face
Fly-fly away, flying down the highway
Living in the moment with my shorty right beside me
Touch the sky up, take it higher

Will make it right, make it right oh yeah today

fall on the ground and cry like a baby till I feel better
All I want is R.E.S.P.E.C.T.
I'm not your basic, average, typical hottie

Domesticate me, dominate me, and you'll see

First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind

One pound for the house, that's all we need baby
Just one for the house. c'mon

Pimp juice - oooohoooooohhoooooooohhh

Let her loose, let her loooooose
She only want me for my pimp juice (that's all she want me for f'real)
Not my pimp juice, I'm talkin her pimp juice

Yes I do, yes I doooooo-hoooo

I'm in that, seventy-four, Coupe DeVille
With the, power seats, leather, wood on my wheel
One-touch sunroof BUT leave it alone
Hoes see it can't believe it - "It's goin back on it's own"
Oooooooooooooooh, shit, that's how we do it baby
"Every day like this?" Seven dayy-ayyys

Winter spring and fall, in the summer we ride
You actin like you never seen it befo'
Like them country boys ain't got no dough
Bitch please - GET IN - but don't you slam that do'
DUST YOUR SHOES OFF - befo' you touch that flo'
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?

And I love it when you make your knees touch your elbows
And break it down low to the flo', and there you go
Now throw it on me slow
And everytime I Bust a rhyme, baby "Gimme Some Mo'"
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind
And I'll be right back; yeah that's my very next line
I use it - time after time, when I'm speakin my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, "Who dat is, talkin that shit about the 'tics?"
Somebody probably jealous cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, HEY!

Yo she's lookin' over here but she won't get it out me y'all

Shake it off, that's how you play it off
Shake it off, that's how you play it off
Not now, no you can't take it off
But play it off, she won't know a damn thing

I play it off 'til it's played out
I had her motherfuckin' ass on the couch, honey laid out
She hintin' around at gettin' ate out
I know I'm spaced out, but the shit sound way out
So I had to take a playa out, switch up my whurrabouts
'Cause she was tryin' to turn a playa out
And plus she know a nigga blazed out
And lil' mama gon' crack a window, let the haze out

She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Gotta make, sure, I don't get attached
That ba-da-buh-da
But it keeps, on, bringin' me back

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering?
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing

From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's all his fault again that's what you tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again

See how ya day going I know they stressin' on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for ya, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me, oh girl?
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl?
We gon' do it our way, our way

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time

We never had a problem with gettin' it done

And I can't take it yeah I can't shake it

I can't wait to see you
Want to see if you still got that look in your eyes
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we got to spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same things
Over and over again
Ohh

Jealousy in the air, other girls wanna be her
She young right now, she's an up-and-comin diva
She ain't gotta measure up, but she gotta be off the meter
But if I can dance with Cindy, I can dance with Shaquita
Cause I know I can, I shall, I will
I feels I can, I felt
I plays with a whole lotta mil's
You ain't talkin 'bout nothin if you ain't talkin 'bout dollar bills (hey!)
Shorty glow shine, so fine, you gotta keep her (hey!)
Pretty toed, half Black, half senorita (hey!)

Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo it's three in the mornin' and the party's still goin'
Bass still knockin', Pimp Juice still flowin'
'Tics in the back, you can smell the chronic blowin'
I got girls all around, I got my Hef' game goin'

Baby girl right but her partner got ass
Baby girl left but her partner got ass
She got 'em stuffed in them boy shorts covered up with lil' hearts
Her partner got 'em laced, cut right below the waist

You can tell they got taste by they ensemble
One like to salsa, the other, the mambo
Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?

They like to work out, and I ain't talkin' Tae-Bo
They like fast cars, I ain't talkin' Volvos
They both are the devil but they like the Diablo
Don't worry got it covered just listen to Ronald

I didn't know there'd be troubles along he way
Nobody told me nothin', nobody told me nothin', nothin'

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I went through eight different schools and twelve different years
That's thirty different teachers over ten thousand different peers
And I done fought nearly everyone, been suspended every time
Besides a few were felony and commited dirty crimes

But never braggin' no, I just want you to see me where I have been
I never proud of it so I don't have to go back there again
And I used to go like house to house sleepin' on couch to couch
Walk around sticking out my hands, looking for a hand out

Only thing got handed out was more bills
Only thing that pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills

Ain't for that our or go and beat the block
Ain't no way you can heat the cops
Ain't no way I could beat the clock
Just a matter of time, shut down your shop

You stay up day and nights, livin' this way of life
I was young and restless all my children came and then I had a guidin' light
No more of that sittin', man, sittin' and waitin' and thinkin'
Somebody coming to take me up off the streets, but now I know

I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a General Custard
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Superbowl - with Julius Peppers
I got that cain't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they cain't stop, won't stop, screamin the name
NELLY! NELLY! Go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'ma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win
Up, or down ten, I'ma fight to the end
Breathing hardLet's go

Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin
I'ma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering?
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing

From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's all his fault again that's what you tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again

See how ya day going I know they stressin' on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for ya, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me, oh girl?
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl?
We gon' do it our way, our way

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time

We never had a problem with gettin' it done

She said her name was (paradise)
Thats what she said to me
She said (paradise)
Thats what she said it would be
Cuz she, the finest women that ive ever did see
And not to mention how she looked in them jeans, ah ah ah

She said her name was (paradise)
Thats what she said to me
She said (paradise)
Thats what she said it would be
Cuz she was, the definition of a ghetto queen

And you should see that apple bottom in jeans

I met her on a sunday, one day
She walkin down the runway
5'5"
So fine what the fuck im gon say
And i just sit patiently just waiting my turn
Waiting for my perfect chance so i can spit out my words
I think she openly spokenly damn i hope she notices me
Hopefully she go for me
So she on the boat with me
And ima take her places she can never imagine
Like water ski'in in costa rica
With snow mobiling in aspen
She prefer the cold
Winter, snow
And does she like tropical
Am i dreamin let me know
Tell me is it possible
That i could be the one she in search for a man
And she could be that one that end my search for romance

Hoo, hoo
Well well well, yeah

There's this girl and I see her every day
But she don't know me
(She don't know my name)
And it ain't all that strange to me
(She don't know my name)

'Cause I know hers and it won't be long
'Til she's convinced that I'm her man
The one that's gon' take her away

Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo it's three in the mornin' and the party's still goin'
Bass still knockin', Pimp Juice still flowin'
'Tics in the back, you can smell the chronic blowin'
I got girls all around, I got my Hef' game goin'

Baby girl right but her partner got ass
Baby girl left but her partner got ass
She got 'em stuffed in them boy shorts covered up with lil' hearts
Her partner got 'em laced, cut right below the waist

You can tell they got taste by they ensemble
One like to salsa, the other, the mambo
Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?

They like to work out, and I ain't talkin' Tae-Bo
They like fast cars, I ain't talkin' Volvos
They both are the devil but they like the Diablo
Don't worry got it covered just listen to Ronald

There's this girl and I see her every day

plus you found out he had another chick cross-town,
it's always the darkness right before the sun rises
and you gotta stay strong for the kids in their eyes and
please don't despise and go against all brothers and
have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another,
i hate to sound tupacish now momma but keep your head up,

and that, that don't kill you only makes you stronger
and the will to succeed will only feed the hunger, fo' reel (fo' reel, fo' reel)

Leather is like your seats

I didn't know there'd be troubles along he way
Nobody told me nothin', nobody told me nothin', nothin'

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I went through eight different schools and twelve different years
That's thirty different teachers over ten thousand different peers
And I done fought nearly everyone, been suspended every time
Besides a few were felony and commited dirty crimes

But never braggin' no, I just want you to see me where I have been
I never proud of it so I don't have to go back there again
And I used to go like house to house sleepin' on couch to couch
Walk around sticking out my hands, looking for a hand out

Only thing got handed out was more bills
Only thing that pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills

Ain't for that our or go and beat the block
Ain't no way you can heat the cops
Ain't no way I could beat the clock
Just a matter of time, shut down your shop

You stay up day and nights, livin' this way of life
I was young and restless all my children came and then I had a guidin' light
No more of that sittin', man, sittin' and waitin' and thinkin'
Somebody coming to take me up off the streets, but now I know

My shit was far from legal
Wrong place on a Buick Regal
Check under that seat, look in the back of that trunk is truly legal
Hold up, better pump your brakes
You don't wanna make no mistakes
Runnin' up on the wrong nigga at the wrong time might get you somethin' hot in your face
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no mace
I'm talkin' that shit that chase
That shit that'll run you down and take forensic files gonna solve that case
I hear a lot of that I did this
I hear a lot of that I did that
It's funny when he go to the stand and point at his man like "he did that?"
You wanna stand lookin' so not gangsta
Pleadin' to the judge, "I'm so not gangsta"

See, it's just best to play yo part

It took this long for me to man up and have this conversation
But fuck it, here it go

I slap a nun, beat the reverend up, spit in his church

My derrty niggaz come through, we turn the heat up in June
We at the party mackin', even throw a bitch in the room
Ménage-à-trois, Murph' is [Incomprehensible], me and Law
'Cause we the baddest muh'fuckers that you seen thus far so

Nigga chill, calm down
Watch your words, don't let your mouth get ahead of ya
You really talkin' reckless right now
And we know you ain't built for that

Nigga chill, calm down
Watch your words, don't let your mouth get ahead of ya
You really talkin' reckless right now
And we know you ain't built for that

Look, learn, listen, check it, start your cars up, trick your broads out
Pump your hard up, homie, now put your guard up
You throw that one two but, look how I jab you
No need you run in the derrty, homie I had to

You was doin' a lot of talkin', a lot of barkin'
But your bite was nothin', guess, you mighta been frontin'
Yo ain't no mic to it, city see right through it
I was born to be the shit like I was Mike Hewitt

Don't test me though, homie I might do it
Check my track record, the feelin' go right to it
It was easy for me, I was born to win

Got 30 down at da bottom, 30 mo' at da top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks

Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what
Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I'm going down down baby your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what
Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping bub, getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because accumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted
Fans fainted while I'm entertaining
Wild, ain't it
How me and money end up hanging
I hang with Hannibal Lector, hot shit
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud
I'm from the Lou and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause
I'm righteous above the law
Player my style's raw
I'm Born to Mack like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour
Give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics
Gin, tonic and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic
Slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics til the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

She all nearly smoked

First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind

It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme

All that pressure you applyin' it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off

And I'll be right back; yeah that's my very next line
I use it - time after time, when I'm speakin my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, "Who dat is, talkin that shit about the 'tics?"
Somebody probably jealous cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, HEY!

Andele andele mami, E.I. E.I.
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh! What's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele mami, E.I. E.I.
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh! If the head right, Nelly there ery'night

You see the magazines and me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really don't, you don't even know
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself so I, I splurge a lil' Hell
You see the money and the cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really don't, it really, really don't
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself so I, I splurge a lil' Hell

I think the time has come, for me to have some fun
I'm 'bout to peel back the top and go on and let in the sun
What the fuck I've done? My Mama's only son
I went from slangin' and bangin' to yellin' number one
I love my fans to death, until my last breath
Thats why when I perform I give until there's nothin' left
No competition, my opposition gon' feel the pain
More complications, relationships ain't gon' be the same
Do they want the fame and all that it can bring?
If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes
I'm poppin' collars from California to D.C.
I'm in the V.I.P., Louis bottles and Hennessey
I'm puttin' mileage on twenty inches and twenty three's
I'm flippin' out my keys, I'm flippin' down the screens
I'm 'bout to spread my wings, tryin' to fulfill my dreams
Want anythin' that I want, if I don't I got the means

You see the magazines and me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really don't, you don't even know
But I, I'm feelin' good about myself so I, I splurge a lil' Hell
You see the money and the cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really don't, it really, really don't

Man you better leave your girl at home man
Cuz if I catch her in the club all alone man
