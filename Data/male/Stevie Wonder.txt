******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Ev'ry morning 'fore the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my fav'rite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll stay with me until the end
Ev'rybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Will I call her on the telephone
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far, for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect 'come true'
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say, "Come back some other day"

And though you don't believe that they do
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Little boy under the shade
Come come run here to me
I will pay you a quarter
If you be my water boy

Mister you know it ain't no fun
Working out in the hot sun
Pay me a half a dollar
Then I'd be your water boy

Lil' boy sure sounds funny
You don't wanna make no money
I can go down to the corner
And get me a dozen water boys

Mister if you think its funny
Don't wanna pay no money
Go on down to the corner
Get you a dozen water boys

(Water Boy)

With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

And my dreams are drifting away
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Turn your lamp down low

Now I know I've been away
For such a long time

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far, for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect 'come true'
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say, "Come back some other day"

And though you don't believe that they do

Is every century
A spiral we all climb?

I guess time will teach us all
Time will teach us all

Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?
Isn't she pretty?

Sunny,
Yesterday my life was filled with rain.
Sunny,
You smiled at me and really eased the pain.
The dark days are gone,
And the bright days are here,
My Sunny one shines so sincere.
Sunny one so true,
I love you.

Sunny,
Thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny,
Thank you for the love you brought my way.

Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
She's so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumblin', her world is crumblin'
Because of you, uh uh
One day you'll hurt her, just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch

Hey, hey
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray, oh yeah
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
You're gonna send your baby straight to me

I'm gonna give her all the lovin'

Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

You know what we gon' do?
We gon' bring it down to Earth

Bring it down to earth, I don't understand
Bring it down to earth, I don't understand
Bring it down to earth, I don't understand

Power ignites the Fourth Horseman, turbo
I kick styles like Data, computer reading
Miles away to beam Star Trek
Movin' my style up, Optimums level 4
I get it warp speed, yous on my space tour
Get with the elements, eloquent spacecraft
Change my gamma flow, one-three-eight-seven
Twenty-oh-nine-six, cereal silver seven
I got the skills to rap, so what you want Spock?
Style like Captain Kirk, gamma ray one block

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect 'come true'
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say, "Come back some other day"

And though you don't believe that they do

Lil' boy sure sounds funny
You don't wanna make no money

And get me a dozen water boys

Don't wanna pay no money
Go on down to the corner
Get you a dozen water boys

From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man allright,
Oh, but he was doing a-wrong
Just to show you what came happen

A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect 'come true'
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say, "Come back some other day"

And though you don't believe that they do

Very superstitious, writings on the wall,
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall,

Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past.

Then we suffer,
Superstition ain't the way.

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
...

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration cause we all know in our minds

That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you

And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday

Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition

Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion

And we all know everything
...

Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If he's with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky---ALWAYS
Until the ocean covers every mountain high---ALWAYS
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea---ALWAYS
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind Cause I'll be loving you always

...

Frankie & Johnny were sweethearts
At least, that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man allright,
Oh, but he was doing a-wrong
Just to show you what came happen

A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

At least, that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man allright,
Oh, but he was doing a-wrong
Just to show you what came happen

A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mother's stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war)
And the battle with us
I know that Black lives matter and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangsters is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods
I don't believe the news or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again
...

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by

(Find the sun comes shining through)

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness

Decided to smile

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect 'come true'
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say, "Come back some other day"

And though you don't believe that they do

And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
My blue horizon is turning gray
And my dreams are drifting away
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
It brings a tear,
Into my eyes,
When I begin,
To realize,
I've cried so much,
Since you've been gone,
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears,
I sit and cry,
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Now, baby when you sigh
(when you sigh)
I wanna sigh with you
When you cry
(when you cry)
I wanna cry some, too

Now, ain't that love
(ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love that I feel
(that I feel)
In my heart for you

When your friends
(when your friends)
Turn their back on you
I'll be here
(I'll be here)
Just to see you through

Now, ain't that love
(ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(ain't that love)
Ain't that love, ooohhh now

Little boy under the shade
Come come run here to me
I will pay you a quarter
If you be my water boy

Mister you know it ain't no fun
Working out in the hot sun
Pay me a half a dollar
Then I'd be your water boy

Lil' boy sure sounds funny
You don't wanna make no money
I can go down to the corner
And get me a dozen water boys

Mister if you think its funny
Don't wanna pay no money
Go on down to the corner
Get you a dozen water boys

Frankie & Johnny were sweethearts
At least, that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man allright,
Oh, but he was doing a-wrong
Just to show you what came happen

A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far, for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect 'come true'
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say, "Come back some other day"

And though you don't believe that they do
