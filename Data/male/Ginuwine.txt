And my thoughts are telling me, I’m tripping
Used to say I didn’t care, found your bags packed upstairs
With all that talking tough, I’m about to lose you

If this is my last chance (come on) to love you
I’m gonna play it like a grown man ought to
If I only got one shot (yeah) to win you
Then call me Jordan 4th quarter in 92, yeah

Cuz I know I played the game
Found out I met the change
Till I found you (Till I found you)

I would've known the first thing to do
If I really had the chance with you
Since you've burned into my life
You've shown me the love that's true

Seems like I've been around the world
Cuz I've had my share of heartbreak
All these other women
Don't compare to you

[Hook:]
So I wanna know something
Can you and me go out on the weekend
Babygirl you leave me speechless
Wake me up cuz I must be dreaming

Beh-beh-beh Baby close my eyes
Now that I got you by my side

And you feel we're ready now (and I want it just as bad as you)
Girl I can't help but to smile
Can't believe it's going down (cause this is something you don't have to do)
I promise I'll be gentle
Just hold on tight and pull me in slow
If you're ready then I'm ready tell me right now
When you throw it at me bet I won't strike out
I'ma hit it out the park and put your lights out

You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight

Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good
Why it takes so long for me finding you

Without you right here having my back

Oh, yeah, babe
My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one

I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life

You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight
Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good

Why'd it take so long, finding you
This is my story and I'm telling you
It's not fiction, it's surely a fact
Without you right here having my back

I really don't know just where I'd be at
My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then (Ooh... oh...)

The only time I drink a 40
Is when I wanna drink a 40
And usually when I wear a suit
I leave with not one but two

I'm not trying to hurt nobody
You only live once they told me
You can't be mad at me
I can just be G

Even though I got my own C.D.
Maybe even on T.V.
There ain't no changing me
I can only be me, me, me

Even though I might be on T.V.
'Cause I got my own C.D.
All you will ever see
Same ol' G

I used to be the main one clubbin'
But now I choose to stay at home
Most of my friends still thuggin'
This time the Gs full grown

I'm thinking 'bout my future lately
Whatever that may be
But now it's clear to me

You know what baby? I'm so glad that you're mine
And I'm yours, I thank God for you
And you just make me better, you're my betta half

Who loves me like you do?
Oh baby baby
Who loves me like you do?

Listen baby, there just ain't another way for me to say it
How much I thank the Lord for you
I know I would have never seen the light of day
Without your strength to guide me through

You are my homie, my best friend, my lover, my dime
To show you what I'm feeling, and let you know it's real
There is no mountain I won't climb

It hurts me, just to know your hurting
It kills me, just to know your sad

You bring me comfort to my soul give me such a high
No I will never let you go
Make me wanna fly to the top of every rainbow

Gimme some cheese, eggs, steaks and grits
And hit the after party with G and them boys Clipse

In them Air Force One's and all white band new tees
Plus I got these two honeys tryin' juke on me
You've got the ignition and girl, I've got the key

So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much too many 'cause we ridin' tonight
And it's that pimp talk, that pimp walk
It's big pimpin' over here, playa ya just start
See we're fresh with Air One's, Lexus and big drums

Holding your hand (hand)
Please tell me baby (baby)

And I'm so awfully scared
I need someone who feels me
I need someone who loves me

Why do I stay a while with you?
We can confess what we've been through
To one another, to each other
There's nothing I'll keep from you

Why don't you reach and grab my hand?
I'll be the one who understands
You can count on me, I won't do you wrong
I'll be here with open arms
...

Two reasons I cry
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone
And I'm all alone - I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
Cause my momma's gone and my daddy's gone
And my heart is torn - I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone
There are two

Daddy I miss you, it's hard to cope with my life
Didn't want to go on without you daddy (Still at night I cry)
I still can't understand why did you have to leave me
Why couldn't I just have seen all your pain - now I blame myself
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, cause when your parents
Are gone it's hard to believe

Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't
mean I'm out to cut
Just because, boo, I got game, doesn't
mean I'll forget your name
Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip
It's hard to believe a player like me, could treat
you like a lady ... Just Because

Hearing my name every other day,
people gonna say what they wanna say
But they don't really know me babe,
hate on me 'cause a brother paid
Only known you for a short time, things that you're
hearing weighing on my mind
If you feel me, here's what I suggest, let
me put your fears to rest

Baby I admit it, (I used to), hit it and
I quit it
(But I' trying to), learn to be committed, to
you and only, I'm your man

Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't
mean I'm out to cut
Just because, boo, I got game, doesn't
mean I'll forget your name
Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip
It's hard to believe a playa like me, could treat
you like a lady ... Just Because

What we gonna do right here
Is take you way back
Way back into time
My man Ginuwine
For all y'all people out there
Bobby to the speaker
It's sung by me
Now, Ginuwine speaking

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat

This is for all you who are connected
With the 2 way, ya heard me?

It's a 2 way street, it's a 2 way door
It's a 2 way life, pick it up and 2 way me
It's a 2 way sky, it's a 2 way tell
It's a 2 way life, pick it up, girl, and hit me

Girl it's so easy, it ain't as hard as you trying to make it seem
All you gotta do is pick it up, compose a message straight to me
I won't hear your voice but all your thoughts, that's what I sure will see
Go to and push them key and tell me all of them freaky things

Now you got some choices to make, you got them colorful, girl one
You got them black ones, platinum ones, well me?

I prefer that platinum thing, to go with all my platinum chains
Plus it's hot to death I figure, plus I'm just that platinum nigga

If it's dark light it up, put 'em up, put 'em up
If it's closed, flip it up, in the club, beam me up

I got mine on vibe if you get at me, I'll feel you
I'll call you back real quick, no lie, better yet, I'll just reply

I wanna read your mind and see if you're thinkin' about me

A Wedding song
Music begins
Oh, hey...
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
To you
Mmm... mmm... mmm...

Oh, yeah, babe
My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one

I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life

You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight
Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good

Why'd it take so long, finding you
This is my story and I'm telling you
It's not fiction, it's surely a fact
Without you right here having my back

I really don't know just where I'd be at
My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then (Ooh... oh...)

You know baby
I know alot of people are against you
All the ladies in the world
But you can do whatever you set your mind to do
Can't no one stop you
Believe that

It's time, now's the place, do your thing, it's your world
Don't be scared, its your world, don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world

I can't begin to feel the agony I know you feel
I'm tryin' to break you out of that mold that once was real
But you're grown up and now it's time to let go all your fears
It's time for you to go,
its time for you to live
You've been under your parents,
but they can't live for you
You got to go and do
what's best for you
Make your decisions and live by them and sweat and bleed
You must struggle to be you
Even when you're in need

Convinced I had it all, fell in love quicker
Been goin' through it all this time

Must be out your mind or on some strong liquor

I'm all off in the corner 100 honeys takin' pics
They be in the V.I.P. with lots of chicks
I'm pimped out now, low cut, and a pick
G and Big Tymers together, that's what I'm talkin'

Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbin' like hell, yeah

Woah, it's the remix
Woah, it's the remix
Woah, it's the remix

Chitti chitti bang bang boom like a pow
Everybody up in the club gettin' wild
Drinks everywhere, the crowd is real loud
Looks like we gonna be here for a while
I'm so drunk, I'm just droolin' at the mouth
Tryin' to get somebody to take me to my house, so
So now where my car keys at? And where my money at?
I'm gonna follow y'all to the, ah, where the honeys at
Gimme some cheese, eggs, steaks and grits
And hit the after party with G and them boys Clipse

Your a ooo ooo ooo
Look out for the po po
Ooo ooo ooo
Smokin' on the dro dro
In them Air Force One's and all white band new tees
Plus I got these two honeys tryin' juke on me
You've got the ignition and girl, I've got the key
It's the Pide Piper so people follow me

So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much too many 'cause we ridin' tonight
And it's that pimp talk, that pimp walk
It's big pimpin' over here, playa ya just start
See we're fresh with Air One's, Lexus and big drums
White shirt, plenty chicks, plenty Kris, big fun
Ma, you worry none, the minks come with the guns
The Prada, the Gucci, it's all in the bird fun

Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't
mean I'm out to cut
Just because, boo, I got game, doesn't
mean I'll forget your name
Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip
It's hard to believe a player like me, could treat
you like a lady ... Just Because

Hearing my name every other day,
people gonna say what they wanna say
But they don't really know me babe,
hate on me 'cause a brother paid
Only known you for a short time, things that you're
hearing weighing on my mind
If you feel me, here's what I suggest, let
me put your fears to rest

Baby I admit it, (I used to), hit it and
I quit it
(But I' trying to), learn to be committed, to
you and only, I'm your man

Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't
mean I'm out to cut
Just because, boo, I got game, doesn't

Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip
It's hard to believe a playa like me, could treat

But been all up on her bubble, say man this girl is trouble

Baby girl, you know you're sexy the way you move you're body
Hope the music never stops, I like the way you wind
Don't pay me no attention, I'm just admiring that body
I'm enjoying my view strictly from behind

You stay on the Internet every chance you get
So you won't have to see my face

Gotta go get me a drink, I need some time to think
And then clear my head
I'm tempted to get another shorty in this bed
But I come home instead

'Cause even when I'm mad I'll be wanting to see her
Wanting to please her, I can't help it, I got it bad
Yeah, she be trippin' sometimes, she won't listen sometimes
But I'm glad that she's mine, oh, even when I'm mad

Sometimes I swear that I'm gonna walk away
But ain't no way I could ever stay away, I love you, baby

Look me in my face, you can see that I've changed

But you still act so selfishly, keep blamin' it on me
When you know you're just afraid to fall
You can't run and hide
We're almost to the other side

You need to stop makin' excuses
For all the wrong you do

Maybe even on T.V.
There ain't no changing me
I can only be me, me, me

Even though I might be on T.V.
'Cause I got my own C.D.
All you will ever see
Same ol' G

I used to be the main one clubbin'
But now I choose to stay at home
Most of my friends still thuggin'
This time the Gs full grown

I'm thinking 'bout my future lately
Whatever that may be
But now it's clear to me

You know what baby? I'm so glad that you're mine
And I'm yours, I thank God for you
And you just make me better, you're my betta half

Who loves me like you do?
Oh baby baby
Who loves me like you do?

Listen baby, there just ain't another way for me to say it
How much I thank the Lord for you
I know I would have never seen the light of day
Without your strength to guide me through

You are my homie, my best friend, my lover, my dime
To show you what I'm feeling, and let you know it's real
There is no mountain I won't climb

It hurts me, just to know your hurting
It kills me, just to know your sad

To the end of any valley
Then you give me piece of mind
You bring me comfort to my soul give me such a high
No I will never let you go
Make me wanna fly to the top of every rainbow

Would you trust me?

But you feedin' me, All this rap about,

You and me, cuz this is not how I want it or it should be.

Told me you were leavin'.

Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one

Glad you came into my life

You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight

And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good

Why'd it take so long, finding you
This is my story and I'm telling you

Without you right here having my back

Don't deserve the kind of things that I put you through
Let me show you, baby, what you worth
More than these chicks runnin' 'round girl, I'll prove it to you, girl

I don't wanna fight and I don't wanna fuss
I just wanna kiss you and just make love
Touch you like this and I touch you like that
You gon' forget, gon' forget, gon' forget why we're fighting

'Cause I don't wanna scream, don't feel I gotta cuss
Baby, let me kiss you so we can make love
When I touch you like this and I touch you like that
You gon' forget, gon' forget, gon' forget what we're fighting for

Seen you the other day, still looking so fine
Hating that I lost what I had in you
If I could turn back time I would make a change
And never do the things that I done to you

I see you're doing good
Shawty, your career is taking off like mine
And what we could have done together
What a shame, I'm 'bout to lose my mind

It's starting to hit me now
All I think about is what could've been
And I just sit around thinking about you
Only what could've been

It could've been us with the kids, house on the hill
You the First Lady and I'm the President
Now all that I did, not worth this
Thinking 'bout what could've been, thinking 'bout what could've been

I'm reflecting on the past, that special thing we had

You saw me sittin all alone, at the bar with my hat tipped low
drinkin a glass of gin with no ice
And even though I sipped it slow, it would burn like a volcano
that's when you came sat down and said hi
And you didn't even recognize who I was but I didn't mind,
cause I didn't feel like signing autographs
You saw me as a normal guy and you treated me oh so nice
You just wanted to know why I looked sad
That's when I said

[Chorus]
I'm sad cause I hurt a soul tie
and when she left my soul died
thought we'd be togther for life
(thought we'd be together for life)
I lost her because of my damn pride,
I'm a man that can't cry, but look at me now,

Why she hatin' on me, I don't really know
What this is all about but I'm finding out

And grabbing on my arm and telling me things

So I jumped up in my Rover

Had to climb up in your window
'Cause your mom's and pop's was sleep
When I did, you just took one look
And you jumped all over me

It's somethin' that I rather not mention
But you had me standin' at attention
Do you remember? Do you remember?
Do you remember? Do you remember?

Remember what we did last night?
We boned on your momma's couch
And we knocked the springs right out

I promise that you won't want to get off

Jump on it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Sitting here flossing
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
...

I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I freak you out
I promise that you won't want to get off

Jump on it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Sitting here flossing
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
...

What we gonna do right here
Is take you way back
Way back into time
My man Ginuwine
For all y'all people out there
Bobby to the speaker
It's sung by me
Now, Ginuwine speaking

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
...
