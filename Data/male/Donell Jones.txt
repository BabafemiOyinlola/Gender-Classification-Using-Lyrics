Hit the park and parlay
Hopin' that u walk this way

I said, "I left my baby girl a message
Sayin' won't be coming home, I'd rather be alone"
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she'll give me some time I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"
I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee

Yo whats up boo?
I know we never had a love like this before
But you know, I wanna be that one for you
Yo Tim and Bob, drop that

And I'm not the average guy
'Cuz I cherish you and I'm lovin' you baby
I'm tellin' you to single these guys
'Cuz you really got my heart

You better hold onto me tight
It's not a dream it's reality
And if you down you got me for life
'Cuz I really love you, girl

I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night

Every night I'm treatin' you right
'Cuz our chemistry is a mystery
To everyone lookin' from outside
'Cuz they want what we have

When I look right in your eyes
I see your soul and I'm the mate baby
If you down you got me for life
'Cuz I really love you, girl

Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin' for the rest of your life
'Cuz I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring

Hope you accept this invitation

Shorty claimed she never had sex before
He's driving Benz and got a lot of dough
He takes her to the movies and buys her Nike's yo
And makes sure she think that she got it all
Ain't even recognizing the signs of a booty call
Better listen to what I'm telling y'all got to show her what she's worth

It makes me wanna cry
Cause the shorty's being treated just like a woman
It makes me wanna cry
Cause her parents ain't even trying to confront him
It makes me wanna cry

It makes me wanna cry
Get back in the church read your Bibles get out the struggle

Stop playing around and puttin' me down
Stop holding back, you gotta react

Babygirl thought I was into her beauty and not her mind
But it's everything about her that keeps this brother in line

So exotic in the face, man this girl's a cutie
Making moon arch from the back ‘cause she got that head move
But the more that we're together her better qualities shine
I've been waiting for this moment to tell ‘er what's on my mind

Beautiful as you are
Don't mean a thing to me

Got the dirty south bouncin',
Got the west crib talking

The type a nigger that you wanna roll with baby
Dont get it twisted thinkin' i'm a sugar daddy
You can look like Halle with an ass like JLO
And a smile like Janet but thats not enough
You may think that i'm tripping take a minute and just listen
It aint all about sex 'cause I can always get that
I'm a million dollar nigger need a million dollar woman
Met this chick named Yvett and this what she said

[Verse: Yvette/Beverly]
I can give you everything you need
I can be your freak, even cook and clean
If thats all you got then you cannot get it
'coz I got a chef who can cook all my dinners
Im looking for that nigger who aint cheap,
Take me shopping every week
I play this game for ceeks

[Verse: Donell Jones]
If thats how you get down its a rap and your finnished
There aint no use in me gettin your digits
Im looking for that special girl

[Chorus: Yvette/Beverly/Donell Jones]

Thinkin' bad move, the one that could be creepin'
And takin' your place
You don't even know where I be but we argue now
You gon' be here lonely, yeah
'Cuz she know what I need at night, can't you see?

She wants to take your place
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk on in, don't make a big mistake
Thinkin' I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start talking

Tell me why should I be here tonight
See you don’t wanna hurt me
But we both know this thing that just ain't right
When I go and I go
It's gonna be a little too late
To try get back again
When I don’t have this feelin' no more

Now we're gonna be here talkin' no more
She'll be the reason I leave you alone

Oh why, oh why, oh why you let me do the things I do
But you never did it to me?
I can't believe that I could treat my baby so uncool
All she ever wanted was me

Many nights I watched her cry from silly shit I put her through
Like havin' females callin' the crib
Wish that I could just rewind all the years
I hurt ya boo, oh yeah

It's the Gemini in me, got split personalities
It's Doctor Jekyll and Hyde with me, I'm a provider G
Bills paid on the first you see, you keep a pocket full of currency
You said you'd never leave

Now you tryna turn ya back on me
I understand you got no trust in me but I'll change for you
If you promise that you'll stay with me
Please accept my apology

Looking back I know that I physically neglected you
'Cuz we wasn't havin' no sex
Many years screamed and yelled, ranting and raving like a fool
Mentally abusing you

I hope it's something left inside 'cuz girl I wanna be with you

He takes her to the movies and buys her Nike's yo
And makes sure she think that she got it all
Ain't even recognizing the signs of a booty call
Better listen to what I'm telling y'all got to show her what she's worth

It makes me wanna cry
Cause the shorty's being treated just like a woman
It makes me wanna cry
Cause her parents ain't even trying to confront him
It makes me wanna cry

Get back in the church read your Bibles get out the struggle

Stilettos to match it and a body that won't quit

I looked under her table, to see he got a bill
Attached to shoelace, I had to catch myself
I'm like, damn, isn't she sophisticated?
Smokin' on a Cuban and no other woman is takin'

And it looked like it barf up a bowl tonight
Send the bartender over, see what she like
'Cause that body look way too soft
If she leave it up, the dam gon' set it off

And that's when I stepped to her
Pimpin' my way over, noticed I wanna do her
And then I whispered in her ear
Tellin' her stuff that she wanna hear

Walking her little good thing
Got a limp in her step
She aint paying you no attention,
She hits the shower first,(shower first)
Cause she don't mention she is rushing
Out that door she den got in
Imagine if your girl was home
(And you get off work early)
And she don't even know cause she don't answer the phone
But you sense something is up
And budge through your front door
But there is a fellow running out your back door

What would you do?
If shawty playing games with you
While you at work
She been hitting you were it hurts
Got a couple of dude on her team
But you don't know them
In your home she's always on the go
What would you do?
Would you give her a second chance
Hoping that it wont happen again
Now flip that around, that's what we do
We tell them that we love them, but our hearts aint true

[Verse 1:]
I'm unhappy that you got back with your man
And you forgot all about me
You told me your relationship was about to end
Then you stop taking my calls babe
Thru the grapevine heard you started making plans
That you and him was gone get married
But just last weekend you was laying in my bed
Trying to tell me that you love me
What you gonna do when I tell him we been making love
(You gone make me do something crazy)
What you gonna do when I try to break the two of y'all up
(How would you like it if I show up on your wedding day)
[Chorus:]
Blackmail - he don't know what you been doing
Blackmail - your life I'm about to ruin
Blackmail - and I don't feel bad
Blackmail - you can send my money in a duffel bag
Blackmail - he don't know what you been doing
Blackmail - your life I'm about to ruin
Blackmail - you better watch out who you screw

VERSE 1
I got the top pealed back switching lanes doing 60 on the boulevard
In a rush to see "Tender Roni" down ass chick that'll do anything for me
Infatuated cause her heads on track conversation all that plus
Baby got back
Female version of a hustler (diva) if I was painting a picture she'd
Be my Mona (Lisa)
Heads roll when we do it real big it's like a world premiere
The dark skin version of Brad & Angelina but the opposite of Ike
& Tina (get it)
See what we got is much more than physical in the bed she can
Handle that business though
If she was a penitentiary I'd be a lifer proud to wear that ball and
Chain and the strips

CHORUS
It ain't all about the sex with her
(I finally found a woman that can rock with me)
It ain't all about the sex with her
(She got her own money dollars signs don't mean a thing)
It ain't all about the sex with her

[Verse 1:]
Let's turn each other on let's get into it
We can make love every hour
You already know what the business is
We gone switch it up let me see you grind
Play your favorite song
Girl dance to it the way you move it's like it's your profession
Slowly take it off girl come over here
Turn the music up my bedroom just became a stripclub
[Chorus:]
Girl you're dancing so slow if you give me a lap dance
We'll be making love at my stripclub
We can do anything we want no restrictions baby I can touch
We can do it at my stripclub
No security guards it's just us
I hear you moaning while I'm beating it up
We can make love in my stripclub

Baby girl I wanna make a toast to new beginnings

From other dudes before me never knew what they were doin'

If sin is your best friend I'm talking bout you
Better switch it up before the end come thru
Or you gone live in Gehenna where darkness brew
Better open up your bibles learn the truth
Cause you can have allot of money but you're still living broke
You get it how you get it it don't matter who you hurt
The kids in the hood yes they dying yo
Following influences on TV and radio
And there ain't nobody to blame because we did it
Poor mother earth she done changed
Look how we did her

Dropping bombs on Baghdad
Terrorism nuclear war heads

If you feeling like me
Then you would wonder
Will it ever change

But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave

Sitting at the light she pulled up on my right
Looking in the mirror making sure her shit was tight
I know she felt me watching but was scared to look my way
I know she wants to look, but I think I got her shook

Under pressure, don't know what to do
She's got two cuties with her and I got my peoples too
She put it in one, stepped on the gun, and made a U
Looked inside, gave me a smile, then she blew, what am I gonna do

Tell me, which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin' had me open from the door
Tell me, have you seen her?

She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shinning brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
Tell me, have you seen her? Have you seen her?

She's got a man, another situation
I understand that's how it's got to be
Ain't trying to cause her no complications
I'd walk away, but I'm in too deep
I can't make no plans, got me so frustrated
'Cause in my heart I want you desperately
Done ran away from all the girls I've been dating
When I'm with them, it's only you I see
And she promised me that it would take some time
But she would leave him alone
And the thought of her loving only me
That's the thing that keeps me strong

She give me all her love
But only half the time
Still it's more than enough
To keep my hope alive

Up in the place I see you getting down
Can't help but look at you
Gotta crowd around you
Now you're the baddest thing I've seen tonight
So come on girl let's put it in flight
I got the V-1-2, 6-4-0
Sitting outside of the door
So bring it on, by the way
Your body's plays for
I like the little thing around your navel

Ooh, girl, you know what's up
Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl, you know what's up

Me and my people be rollin', schemin' on you and your homies
The very first day of summer, all chromed out in a hummer, babe
Hit the park and parlay, hopin' that you walk this way
Do you and your girls wanna ride, play all day and puff on the la

Ooh, say what, say what, say what
(You know that I like it, baby)
Ooh girl, you know what's up

Ooh, say what, say what, say what

Ooh, girl, you know what's up

I said, "I left my baby girl a message
Sayin' won't be coming home, I'd rather be alone"
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she'll give me some time I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"
I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee

Yo whats up boo?
I know we never had a love like this before
But you know, I wanna be that one for you
Yo Tim and Bob, drop that

And I'm not the average guy
'Cuz I cherish you and I'm lovin' you baby
I'm tellin' you to single these guys
'Cuz you really got my heart

You better hold onto me tight
It's not a dream it's reality
And if you down you got me for life
'Cuz I really love you, girl

I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night

Every night I'm treatin' you right
'Cuz our chemistry is a mystery
To everyone lookin' from outside
'Cuz they want what we have

When I look right in your eyes
I see your soul and I'm the mate baby
If you down you got me for life
'Cuz I really love you, girl

Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin' for the rest of your life
'Cuz I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring

Hope you accept this invitation

Boo, do you mind if I take this seat right here?

You can hit me on my cell if I'm not home

Are you down to swingin' up with me
Or could it be blinded by all this ice you see?
I'm willing to give you all this love I got
But no relationships involved
Gotta keep it strictly physical

I'm so sincere with it I just want you to know
If you can feel it rock back and forth
He's so sincere with it
We just want you to know if you can feel it rock back and forth

If you can feel it rock back and forth
We so sincere with it we just want you to know
If u can't feel it rock back and forth
Lets go

[Donnell Jones]
Settle down thinking that I can let ya talk to me that way
Making that move, the one that could be creeping and taking your place
You don't even know
Where I be, when we argue now
You gon' be here lonely yeah
Cuz she knows what I need at night

[Chorus]
Can't you, see she wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)

[Donell Jones]
Tell me why should I
Be here tonight
See you don't wanna
Hurt me but we both know this thing just aint right
When I go (and I go)
It's gonna be a little too late
To try get back again
When I don't have this feeling no more

"Where You Are (Is Where I Wanna Be) Part 2"

I'm saying I'm sorry for leaving you
But I wanted to start my life brand new
I was going through changes and could not see
That with you is where I wanna be

Nothing compares to you
And I hurt from the pain that I put you through
Baby, I need you desperately
Cuz I gotta be

Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Every second of a day I wanna be
Where u are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Dont you ever take your love away I wanna be
Where u are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
I cant live without you girl I wanna be

She was 14 and he was 24
Shorty claimed she never had sex before
He's driving Benz and got a lot of dough
He takes her to the movies and buys her Nike's yo
And makes sure she think that she got it all
Ain't even recognizing the signs of a booty call
Better listen to what I'm telling y'all got to show her what she's worth

It makes me wanna cry
Cause the shorty's being treated just like a woman
It makes me wanna cry
Cause her parents ain't even trying to confront him
It makes me wanna cry
Black people we need to show our children a little loving
It makes me wanna cry
Get back in the church read your Bibles get out the struggle
It makes me wanna cry (ooh ooh)

Uh, what
What's goin' on
Yeah, uh, what
What's goin' on

Seemed like everything was cool
Until you came home yesterday (What's goin' on)
And girl, you know I ain't nobody's fool
Yet you insist on treating me this way (What's goin' on)
And I can't believe after all that we've been through
You still think you can hide from me, yeah (What's goin' on)
See I know something's wrong with me and you
This ain't the way true love's suppose to be
Are you still feelin' me

Am I still the one you love
Why does it seem like something's changed
With you and me
Oh how I wish things were the way they used to be
I need to know if you still believe
Do you still believe in love

If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
Spending big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down

If I ride for you, die for you
If I floss at any cost for you
Shorty, all I wanna know from you
Is when ya gonna put me down

First time I saw you, I was breathless
Looking flawless, fifty on the neclace
And I had to add you to my guest list
Let you pass, I had to put it down
We sipped and kicked a little convo'
It's time to head back to the condo
And I know what we both came here for
Let me know what you're feeling now

Do you want to open up and show me your love
Stop playing around and puttin' me down
Stop holding back, you gotta react
When ya gonna hold me down

You're perking, plus we're working
All this flirting got me hurting
When you know I don't deserve this girl
Why ya gonna hold me down

If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back

I've been tryin to find my way back to you
Just didn't know how
But I remember you placed a beacon inside my heart
So when I'm close... I'll know

Girl I'd walk a million miles every day and a million more
If I got to get it in to you
But like a bird with a broken wing, I'll never fly all the same
Watch me soar,
If I gotta get to you
And like the wind of a hurricane I wanna blow your way
Girl I'm that storm
I gotta get to you
Without you I don't wanna live another day
My heart is torn,
I gotta get to you

The closer I get to you
It's so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It's so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you

You been here for me so I won't leave you never

Girl I know that you been creepin
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
Its like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

Since the day that I got locked up
My lifes been different. oh yeah.
'cause she was my soul, my heart, my love, my best friend
I can't understand why,
She won't accept my phone calls.
Shoulda knew something was wrong
When mama said "baby its time for you to move on..."
Now that everything I had. is gone

Girl I know that you been creepin
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here

Chillin' at the bar got her eyes on me
Lookin' like she wanna get real freaky
She can get all this love for free
So I hit her off with a hotel key

After giving you everything in the world
Like a brand new Benz, a laced out crib
A pocket full of dough and your baby got milk

Girl why you're trippin'
'Cuz I stayed out late at night
But I locked my keys in my car
After getting off work, didn't think to call

If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me?
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to the question could be the end

I'm guilty for loving you

You don't wanna know where I've been
