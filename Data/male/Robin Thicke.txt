I want a fresh girl

I wanna drink my drink
I wanna get high
I can't have everything
I wanna be rich
Never work at all
And sleep all day
And I wanna see it all
Oh I want, I want everything

I want everything I can't have
When the brandy hits my throat I go

Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da

I don't know how you do it
Working the way you are
Trying to be a mother, earning lady, and a star
I will always day dream
Wishing that you were mine
I understand that now you need some space and time
I can smell your perfume
Your legs on my walls
Your body's on my ceiling
You eagle down the hall
I remember when I was the only one you called
Everything is changed

I gotta get her cool, get her cool, get her cool, get her back
I gotta treat her right

I gotta get her cool, get her cool, get her cool, get her tonight

I never should have raised my voice or made you feel so small
I never should have asked you to do anything at all
I should have kissed you longer
I should have held you stronger
And I'll wait for forever for you to love me again

What can I say
Oh what can I do
When I'm crazy, so crazy for you
And I try not to show it
And I can't control it
I'm still madly crazy for you

See the birds fly
See the blue sky
See the best times of my life
Watch me crawl, watch me beg
Watch me fall deep
Cause I, I just can't stop
I just can't stop thinking 'bout those days

Under sunshine too much wine
Laying in the grass, you were all mine
So be just like heaven

One, two, look at you
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knockin' and knockin' and knockin' and knockin'
(knocks)

She was born in Paris
At the age of 21
Love knew her
But she didn't know love
Love didn't hear her when she cried
Love didn't stand by her side
On the most important night, oh yeah

And now she's flyin' high
You can't hurt her no more
And now she's locked the door
Cause you broke the key
And she got a bright spot on her face
Bow that she got that little taste
She just wants more
She just wants more
She locked the door

I kept trying to tell you you were pushing me too far
(she locked the door)
I kept trying to warn you, you were slowly breaking my heart
(she locked the door)
I kept giving you all of it but you took way too much

Screams at her friends
Jumps on the couch

Man when you see her you'll be standing with an open mouth
Cause she's the Eiffel tower and she's new in town

She be dancing on her tippy toes

Everywhere my baby goes

Dancing on her tippy tippy tippy tippy toes

She's a feather from a dove in a gust of wind
On her own in the clouds, never has to land
Right now is the day when her story begins
She's the leader of the movement of the heart and hips

Straight A's, good girl, loves her mom and dad
She ain't greedy, but she wants so much more than she has
When she looks in the mirror she can love herself
Cause she doesn't want to be like anybody else

And when the world, when the world comes a tumbling down

She's standing there beside you
Touch her hand let it guide you
She's just looking for somebody to love

This is the moment of your life
Everything's changed it all gonna turn out right
We don't know how this little fairy tale ends
Good thing we will always be best friends
Well this is the time of your life
Live it up drink it down
Get up off the ground, take flight
If you practice the right moves
Maybe you'll see
Everything fits so perfectly

She wants to know if anybody's looking

Pushed you right out of my world
I know that you and I have tried very hard to find a different result
But how can we be patient when we're always racing
And no one's ever there to hold

Any time you need a friend baby
I will be the one that you want
And if you're ever down and out baby
I will be there biggin' you up
And you can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
It's longer than always could be
And further than the eyes can see

Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours

Get liquor for the balance the balance
Never get trees so I climb to the atmos

Gotta make it rain, million dolla baby

She loved to fly, She ran away
From something at home, she would not say
She needed new friends, no doors would open
She had no place to stay

Then came a bird, Who knew the town
Who barely ever left the ground
They saw each other, they saw forever
They both knew it right away, oh!

Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind

Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime

So I start making plans.
Take you out to slow dance.

Wrap your hands in my hands.

But we all wanna try to see each other's side
And I'll try till she takes my pillow

She'll say I'm lucky, she'll say I'm the man
We'll talk on for hours as long as I understand
I'd go on without her see see but everyday
Ain't the same, ain't the same, ain't the same

I feel like a puppy when I get time to play

I've got a brand new Jones and nobody even knows
When my baby is gone, it's my thang, my thang
Sometimes I can't let go so I've got to be alone
When my baby is gone, it's my thang, my thang alone, alone

Some like a sweet romance and some wanna travel far
But I like a three point stance and I hate to drive my car

We gonna celebrate tonight
And rock out with the family

Calling all hearts (to the dancefloor)
Tonight, let love start

Leave all your problems and your drama at the door and get down

Watching flowers blossom all around me

I tried wailin' to a wall
Standin' like porcelain, mumblin',
Salt water rollin' down side burns,
Searchin' for the answers, handling the truth
Seein' it for myself is the only way
Forget a winner, stop being a sinner first
Ruining your liver, smoking cigarettes and worse
Love is a killer, the leading cause of suicide
How to survive a day in the life of times

You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted

I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it

I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

What do they make dreams for when you got them jeans on?
What do we need steam for?
You the hottest bitch in this place

I feel so lucky (hey, hey, hey)

Oooh...
Eah!

Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop that feelin' for long no
Mmmm
You makin' dogs wanna beg
Breaking them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home, now

(Ooooh)
See all these illusions just take us too long
(Ooooh) And I want it bad.
Because you walk pretty,
Because you talk pretty,
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'

(Ahhh)
Oh I swear there's something when she's pumpin',
Asking for a raise
(Oooh) Well does she want me to carry her home now?
(Oooh) So does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt,
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

(Ahhh)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you you'll know baby (know)
When I get you alone ('lone)

Don't let me hold you up or intervene or interrupt

But you got the look, I wanna get to know ya better
I had to let her know, yo, I couldn't sweat her
'Cause if you were to see what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean but European

When she spoke her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told a story
Her name was Mahogany, prince name was Ebony
I said my name was Rob and this is Jay-Z

From something at home, she would not say
She needed new friends, no doors would open
She had no place to stay

Then came a bird, Who knew the town
Who barely ever left the ground
They saw each other, they saw forever
They both knew it right away, oh!

Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind

Stressed out, uptight, overworked, riled up
Unleash what you got let's explore your naughty side
Follow me, where we're going, we don't need no bread crumbs
Cant you see, baby? You're the only one

You are among the few hot women
Let me be your medicine
'Cause I got one thing on my mind, I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby, fly away

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

To know that I love you, baby?

And how you think I'm sexy baby

You wanna touch yourself
When you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel, baby

And get out of the cold with me

It makes a man feel good, baby

It feels like you don’t need me anymore
I used to be the answer and the cure
I used to be the life you thought for sure and oh you’re sure on me now
And even though the sun is shining the raging fires are slowly dying
My walls have got me rattling my cage
Look at me look at me again
Set me free Look at me again
I thought you would protect me from the loneliness and shame

Watching flowers blossom all around me

Standin' like porcelain, mumblin',
Salt water rollin' down side burns,
Searchin' for the answers, handling the truth

Ruining your liver, smoking cigarettes and worse
Love is a killer, the leading cause of suicide
How to survive a day in the life of times

And all of the promises you made yourself
Are finally taking shape
You can only hold something so beautiful down so long
Until it finds the light of day

Chorus: Pressure builds diamonds (Aretha)
Shining so (Kiesha) bright for you to see (Paula)
Pressure (Beyonce) builds diamonds (Mary)
Sparkling (Halle) for everyone to see (Oprah)

Whoa

Stressed out, uptight,
Over worked, wound up,
Unleash what you got,
Let's explore your naughty side,
Follow me where we go,
We don't need no bread crumbs,
Can't you see baby,
You're the only one,
You are woman,
You are woman,
Let me be your medicine,
Cuz I got one thing on my mind,
I'll be your valentine,
Spread your wings and baby fly away

It's your body,
You can yell if you want to,
Loud if you want to,
Scream if you want to,
Just let me love you,
Lay right here girl,
Don't be scared of me,
Give you sex therapy,
Give you sex therapy,
It's your body,
We'll go hard if you want to,
As hard as you want to,
Soft as you want to,
Just let me love you lay right here,
I'll be your fantasy,
Give you sex therapy,
Give you sex therapy,

Whoa

I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was flying
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain't even 20 baby
I ain't learned to love you right, yeah
Umm, good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed, oh

For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?

Put on them heels and put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance

We can get married and live in our world
Lets play rough, we can get wild
I could go home but I'll stay
Cheat but I won't

So I go by Weezy, love me or leave me

Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core
When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl

Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings

When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down
But oh I know, I know exactly how you feel

But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe

When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowin down

Rapid fire, what you know about it?

He strapped, he can't wait to come out the barrel

I heard some shouts like "Down on the floor"
Then even louder, "We got shooters, shooter"
I turnin' around, I was starin' at chrome
Shotgun watches door, got security good

Jumped right over counter
Pointed gun at winkin' teller
I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter

They want me with my hands up
Oh, shooter

They want me with my hands up

So many doubt 'cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out
Bang, die, bitch nigga, die, I hope you bleed a lake

New York, L.A., it's all the same
The angels look the other way
'Cause they can't understand my pain

With my hands behind me

Why you crying? What's your name?
Who you running from?
Teddy bear, pink room
Fresh out of high school
Sweet like the evening sun
Mama says don't you think you're special
Daddy says you're my queen
She's afraid, she's going nowhere
Locked and lost between

But oh, lonely girl don't you worry babe?
How can you get by?
Lonely girl don't you live your life
Through someone else's eyes?

Why you sad? What's your name?

Packed house, shared jeans

London town and through Berlin
I can't believe this place I'm in
Everywhere and back again
Porcelain and China dolls
Give me one and I've seen them all
Got my back against the wall
Wonder where I'll be tomorrow?

But wait, now how long could this take?
It's hard to find a man,
When you're gone before he wakes.
They say it's hard to achieve
But can't a girl believe?

Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I can't seem to find
Somebody to love

Baby girl, there you at
Looking at me like a putty cat
Wondering where that thing is at
Wondering where your ring is at
Nobody ever did it quite like this

"When I Get You Alone"

Oooh...
Eah!

Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop that feelin' for long no
You makin' dogs wanna beg
Breaking them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home, now

(Ooooh)
See all these illusions just take us too long
(Ooooh) And I want it bad.
Because you walk pretty,
Because you talk pretty,
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'

(Ahhh)
Oh I swear there's something when she's pumpin',
Asking for a raise
(Oooh) Well does she want me to carry her home now?
(Oooh) So does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt,
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

(Ahhh)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you you'll know baby (know)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone now (it's all mine)

(Ahhhh... oh)
Come on
Oh yeah-yeah

I'd been missin on love it's clear (Oh no)
So she bought me some brand new gear (Oh no)
And she's sending her driver here
I just can't say no to my needs

I feel such a fool when she calls
I can't trust myself
From the picket lines
She's got my love, got my help
Got my control (Oh no)
Got my intentions known
Got me aroused, and it shows

She's a bad girl and you know it
I can see it in her eyes
She's a bad girl, Suga Mama
From the plan she's devised
A bad girl and you know this
Cause the feelings so right
Baby's killin me like a lover should

Me and Jay-Z were cooler than [Incomprehensible]
Seen an all world cover girl
Hey lady, I'm sorry if you're in a rush
Don't let me hold you up or intervene or interrupt

But you got the look, I wanna get to know ya better
I had to let her know, yo, I couldn't sweat her
'Cause if you were to see what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean but European

When she spoke her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told a story
Her name was Mahogany, prince name was Ebony
I said my name was Rob and this is Jay-Z

Cant you see, baby? You're the only one

You are among the few hot women
Let me be your medicine
'Cause I got one thing on my mind, I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby, fly away

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy

Then came a bird, Who knew the town
Who barely ever left the ground
They saw each other, they saw forever
They both knew it right away, oh!

Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind

Why would I go to Rome
And stand in St. Peter's Square
Or gaze at Mona Lisa
With someone who can't compare
I never go without you
I wouldn't even dare
Like Rio De Janeiro was never even there
No need to spend my birthday
With all of my friends in New York City (Boring)
No need to have floor seats
Sevens games Celtics and Kobe (Boring)
You make me say glory hallelujah
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl you know you make me say
Glory Hallelujah (glory)
You're never boring (never boring)

There you go, walking by there
You are the apple of my eye
And I see you coming towards me and
I get this sweating butterflies and
You should know it
You've got to feel it
I'm in love with you for really
I have got to have you tonight

If you knew how cute you looked in your tight dress
and your high heels
Understand why I get caught up staring at you everytime
You pass me by I see your eyes
I feel your hair

I'm dangerous
So dangerous
I'm dangerous
You better stay away
Stay away from me
I'm dangerous

I'm dangerous
So dangerous
Your a lone hitchhiker
And I'm a traveling truck
You better not get on this ride
You might lose your luck
I'm dangerous

You better heed the signs
That's coming across both nights
Starlight in years
I'm slippery and wild
Caution and red flags
I'm gonna cross that line
I'm dangerous

She's the girl you see
Walking down the street
Holding her head high
Unstoppable
She's confident
Got a laser eye
Swinging to her own beat
and an A+ smile
She's a winner
Ooo
She is where it's at
She's as loud as an owl
She can stop the whole crowd
She is Heaven lent
'Cause I know they want her back

She's a full time believer
She wakes up early everyday
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
and she can care less what you say
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
Don't you get in her way

I don't know
I don't know how it feels to be you
Though I tried my best to understand
What you're going through
I don't know how it feels to you

Though I try to learn your step
I don't know what makes you dance
I don't know what turns your gray skies back to blue
Though I try to see your side
I swallow all my pride
There is no way I can take a step in your shoes

Cause I don't know
I don't know how it feels to be you
Though I tried my best to understand
What you're going through
I don't know how it feels to you

So lay your cheeks upon my chest
Tell me everything that haunts your mind oh oh oh
I may not have all the answers
But if you let me I can at least try
And when I'm sure I've had enough
The angels tell me just to wait awhile wooh oh oh
And baby I am sorry
For being so hard on you sometimes oh yeah yeah


But I don't know
I don't know how it feels to be you
Though I tried my best to understand

Sitting underneath the stars
Holding onto to your hand
Wishing on the miracle
And waiting on the sand
Fallen leaves and fallen dreams
They get back up again
When you stare into my eyes
And I never want it to end

The sounds of the jungle and the blue skies
The Earth underneath my feet and a family to call mine
Oh, it's the little things that always get me by
...

Oh yeah yeah,
What would I
What would I be
Without you lovin me
Id be bad and sad and lonley
Tryin to get you back to me
Ohh, I wake up every morning
The same things, troubling my mind
I say to myself, come on now
It's only just a matter of time
But the cold winds blow
And the hard rains fall
And there's only one reason
I can stand through it all

[Chorus:]
What would I
What would I
What would I be
Without you lovin me

Just charge it to my account
I hope I haven't gone over my limit
With interest rates so swift
No need to scream and shout
No doubt if women are from Venus now
I'll get to them somehow

All I want to do is please you
Please myself by living my life too

And all the stupid things I do
Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you
How I feel about
All the stupid things I do have absolutely no reflection on

Oh I got a problem
Rising deep from my bones
Years of hibernation
I can't wait to be exposed
Leaping from the darkness
To feel the new moon and light
It howls like a jet plane and echoes through the night

Oh now you done it
You woke up some stuff
We don't have to talk about it
Round here things might get rough
You poked a sleeping giant
That ain't ate in months
And when it opens it's eyes
First thing it's gonna wanna do

Welcome to joint (?)
Welcome to my room
I'm no longer boy
And you're much stronger, girl (?)
I'm not barracuda
And you're my Thundercat
And we're at war
We're at war with no compass or map
No compass or map

I'm not gonna say a word
To make your walk out the door
And I'll never break your heart
Or make you make not love me more baby
We fit so good together
Everyone says they've never seen better babe
We got the world in our hands
You're my lovers and my best friend

And we are a family
You are my everything
We are a family (woah woah)
You and me and baby makes three (woah woah)
We are a family (family)
You are my everything (you and me)

Yeah
Hey Robin!

Didn't I rock with you all night?
Wasn't it good enough? Don't lie
Didn't you tell me that I blew your mind?
Brought out the animal in me
Nobody else can tame that beast
Why did you have to go and say goodbye?

Now all I wanna do is get, get you back (get, get)
Cause girl, you're still the best that I've ever had
A one, two, three, let's go

You used your love to tear me apart
Now put me back together (now put me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart
Now put me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart
Now put me back together

I wanna live between your legs
Hear all the freaky things you said

Everyone falls, falls down sometime
Sometimes its wrong, and sometimes its right
For every win, I'm gonna fail
But there comes a point when
When I'll exhale
Say shoop now
Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Shooby doop, my love now

I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was flying
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain't even 20 baby
I ain't learned to love you right, yeah
Umm, good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed, oh

For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
