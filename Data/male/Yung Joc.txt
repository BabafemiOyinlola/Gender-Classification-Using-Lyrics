Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many bitches from the club wanna go?
I know you see it, I know you see it

I'm like eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many niggaz in the club wan' go?
I know you see it, I know you see it?

Now you can call me Tip Drill, they playin' my song
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, call it Purp Bodyzone

Now she pussy poppin' yeah it's goin' down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her get another round
And when I make it rain money all over the ground
Fresh Force Ones, Sean John buttoned down

And then I'm like, "Oh, boy, my click full o' stars"
Big fo'-fifth, big dick and big cars
At the end of the day when it's all said and done
I'ma need fo' freaks â€~cause I need more than one

Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many bitches from the club wanna go?
I know you see it, I know you see it

I'm like bim bam I know you wan' some
She chewin' on the dick like a piece of Bubble Yum
I know you see it, I know you see it

And I'm gon' leave with that

Go creep with that, gon' sleep with that
Make her pay a fee for that

Face off in my pillow bitch

Grab my balls like, "it's

That's all that I wear. Gotta

Slow creep through your neighborhood

Wipe it down, I wish you would, bite my style, you wish you could
On my town I rep my hood 'til they lay me down, it's understood
Oh yeah, I ride for my homies, I die for my homies
I lost a couple loved, yeah, I cry for my homies

Big guap on deck, crack rocks on my neck
Patron shots up next, make it rain, leave 'em wet
What I got you can get it, pimp, tell what's the bid'ness pimp?
Fresh cake, then make them flip, then be shoppin’ on the imp

If you think I'm lyin’ then my name ain't Joc
The hustle gotta hollerate ‘cause I ain't gon' stop
Yeah, I play my cards well but this ain't poker, I ain't bluffin’

Living the life of a go-getter, no-quitter
Gotta get to the money, get money, money, hey

Living the life, living the life
Living the life, living the life
I'ma live every day like a holiday
Gotta get to the money, get, get to the money

I've been around the world just like dosey do
Bet Joc Bangkok in Tokyo
Big money by the bankroll, oh, for sure
Ain't tryin’ to brag just as long as you knows

Hey you, tell me why you actin’ like you're shocked?
Been gettin’ money since my debut dropped
Pop a couple tabs with my man and them
Date an international chick, now I'm landin’ them

International suites, now I'm stayin’ in them
International freaks, I'm playin’ with them
Acapulco hoes, hit the sand with them
We fuck all night, then I abandon them

Take a top model chick to the cabin, man
Call me freaky Jason, get to stabbin’, man
But she call a few friends, run a caravan
I call a few friends, I love sharin’ man

Ay you know what, eh-heh
When I started recordin this album
I said I wasn't gonna do a, y'know dear momma type of record but
I felt the need to cause ahhh I wanna express how I feel about my momma
But at the same time I wanted y'all to know that
if I ever found a woman out there that, was anything like my momma
SHIT~! I got to have her

(Chorus: Jazze Pha)
Ain't another girl on this earth, like my momma
But if I find that girl, I'ma make her my woman
If I find another girl, like my momma
I can go unconditional love 'til they take me under

(Yung Joc)
Gyeah; first thing first, where do I start
This feeling that I'm feeling is real it's not a facade
The angel that I call momma was sent by God
Been through thick and thin, better times, even hard
Raisin two boys in the ghetto wasn't easy
Shit was goin wrong but she made it seem peachy
Yeah she worked long hours, whether rain and the freezin

Alright, boys and girls
You finally made it to the end of the album
I hope you learned somethin?
But the best is yet to come
Welcome to Hustlenomics

Who would've imagined that life would be so good, nigga? Now I'm on
? Cause I'm tired of all the games, nigga, now I'm grown
Tell you what the game's missing, right from wrong
Respect game, young nigga, tell them haters so long

You can call me Malcolm X, I hustle by any means
Take the blow, break it down, weigh it on triple beams
I'll cook it, I'll whip it, I'll ship it, I'll flip it
I'll rock 'til the motherfuckin? Feds come knockin?

The owner of the hand, I can be the middleman
Best if you don't know the man I just tax an extra grand
I get you what you want, we call that captain and the booker
Hustlenomics, yeah, I'll chop you one, I got it if you want it

I'm from the slums and the sticks turned crumbs into bricks
Got a bum full of knicks, gun full of hollow tips
And where I'm from we shared everything, we called it hand-me-downs
I implemented Hustlenomics, pimp, look at me now

In an action packed movie about gunfights
grinding, the ol' trap, and most of all, getting money

Oh you already know what it is folk
Hey folk, y'all niggaz watch out, dope boy's comin

Let me paint a picture, here's the backdrop
Niggaz on the block with a sock full of rocks
My intuition tells me, here come the cops
First nigga run, last nigga get knocked
A couple hours later when it's time to get funded
Ten percent of food stamps cost you fo' hundred
I had to use a alias cause I'm a most wanted
Now I'm back in the Chevy on the pedal and I'm runnin

You know I got by the name nitty right

Dis nigga go by the name of Jock
He resides in College Park, right
But for right now what we gotta do for y'all
We gotta give y'all a hit

Niggaz in my face, damn near er' day
Askin' a million questions like, “Jock, where ya stay?"
Tell 'em College Park, where they chop cars
Eat 20 grand spend a grand at the bar

Jest bought a zone, Jay's on my feet
I'm on that patron so get like me
69 cutlass wit' the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks

Catch me in the hood posted at the sto
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough
If a girl choose let her do her thang
Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain

Everybody love me I'm so fly
Niggaz throw the deuces everytime I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do

Meet me in the trap it's goin' down

Where them chopper bullets stop, nobody knows
Babies cryin', niggaz dyin' all over the place
Momma cryin' 'cause there's blood all over her face

This is not a game, this is not a test
Swiss cheese your brain, mayne you'll be laid to rest

See I can't help it, that's just how we get down
Let off a couple rounds, turn your smile to a frown

Yeah, I know, you think I'm bluffin'
'Til I kick the do' and the goons they rush in
Lay down on the flo' where you keep the coke in
You say, "I don't know" then your blood start gushin'

Watch me work them plays like that 95 Madden

I get it nine in the mornin' by night it just plastic
How you do that, I call it dope boy magic
I'm fresh ta death everyday like I jumped up out a casket
How you do that, I call it dope boy magic

I'm numba one to turn a pair of bow Jackson raiders and two
A fresh pair of Mariallen gators three
Out of ten niggaz is some haters
Before it's to late five shots to your tater

Six hundred chromed fronted cotton candy coated Benz
Seven grams of presidential blowin' in the wind
At 4 a.m. the eight, at nine touchdown a beautiful play
In my neighborhood so what now got one

O left you can snatch it for the seven nigga
Keep your chirp on alert just like nine eleven the
Twelve creepin; threw the hood like Jason keep it movin'
Friday 13th but bitch this ain't a movie

I was only forteen when I dropped my first deal
Made a two-way disappear like David Copperfield
Wala, I recorded this a two fifteen
Left dope boy magic beating through your fifteen's

When I drop the work in the pot it bounce back like elastic
How you do that, I call it dope boy magic
Watch me work them plays like that 95 Madden

Pockets on swoll lookin' like they got the mumps
I'm 'bout my change, gotta get the riches
From the look of thangs y'all gettin' JC Penney's

Pass that Patron, the lime's right thurr
Rock with it, lean with it in my Nike urr
Wink my eye at your bitch now she wishin' she could touch
See the J's on my feet and she love the diamond cuts

Ask Chino Dolla 'bout that dope boy magic
Connected like apartments, keep one in the cartridge

Ah, how you feel? I feel good

Ridin' in your Chevrolet drop top
We can do a lot of things with the top dropped
I see you flossin' like a boss babe
New shit make me wanna break you off babe

Now shawty what it is, what's on your mind?
You need some fresh air, push the button the top recline
I'm blowin' on the pine down Martin Luther King
I'm lookin' like a dream with the Chevy so clean

MJ's on gleam, check my gangsta lean
Gorillas in my trunk so you know just how I'm bein'
The peanut butter guts so plush is what I'm used ta
Hit the turbo booster for Mr. Throw the Deuce Up

Paint still drippin' like it's fresh up out the shower
Twelve in the cut, a couple shots of blunt power
I rep the fo'-five flatlands eighty V
I stayed off in the woods, South side, Shady P

Nigga, you don't wanna see me when I'm thirty-eight hot
Yeah, I pay a couple cops just to go and hush 'em up
And we keep that straight drop, we don't play that touch and bust
Got a sixty-nine Chevelle, pimpin', everything for sale
Wrap 'em in the turkey bags, even dogs can't smell
When I take my shirt off, all the hoes stop breathin'
When hit the purp I damn near stop breathin'
Yeah, I'm in and out of traffic, got the old school weavin'
The ice so cold all the hoes start sneezin' (Achoo!)
I'm super p-noid, Joc on alert
Ridin' dirty with the word "no insurance" on the???
I got a couple runners and they don't make beef
I got a full team and all we do is play street
Mookin' Playboy, choppers on deck and we keep a party packed for the papas on deck
Then I hit my nigga Gucci and partner OJ

Yeeeah bitch im flyin' in that flying spur, moon walking like thriller,
Clutchin' that nina ross, bumpin ross yeah im trilla.

I got alzheimers cuz I got old money.
I made the fourps listen that was just show money.
You musta played in Jason, you fallin' in this movie,
I shoulda starred in like mike, I'm ballin' in this movie.
I'm living Harlem Nights wit big birds and mobsters,
You live on Sesame Street wit big bird and Oscar!
Wanna be mad at me? I bet tha choppa change ya posture.
You play on Graze Antamony cuz you gon need a doctor.

Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough
If a girl choose let her do her thang
Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain

Niggaz throw the deuces everytime I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do

Trap stupid (boy you comin through)

my girlfriend say she ain't wanna fuck with you
Say whaaaaaa
Paint the chevy, throw some rims on it too
Roll a blunt for me, and roll one for you
Fuck with me, you're fuckin with the whole crew
Say whattttt (might, might, might as well)

Joc eyeball the purp, I don't need no scale
Got a real trap house, and real clientele
Buy 72, the biggest motor chevy made
built 7 on the horses, real heavy weight
I get head then cake, everyday my birthday
Birthday sex with your bitch, fuck her everyway
Bought to mount it up, goin throw them 30's on it
paint stupid wet, boy i put my ladies on it
Im a guap boy, body all mugged up
tryin to be a hot boy, get your body ___
In high school I brought jewels for show and tell
Oh well I'm fly as hell, might as well

Should I ride the Benz
Or should I ride the Porsche
Ima ride the slab, cause it match my Air Forces
I need to build a stable, to hold all of my horses (yeah boy)
I got 455, imagine having two
Yeah, this is how it feels ridin' 500 horses
I can't hear the music, the pipe's too noisy
This is how it feels ridin' 500 horses
High speed chase twelve(?) can't catch me
Five hundred horses, that's a stampede
Young, rich, and thuggin' plus the whole hood?
Pullin' off the lot lookin' like I push big block
'69 Camaro 396 big block
All original interior I like my shit stock
I'm the way to MLK I gotta make a pit stop
Pull up to the rim shop flip flop, swag it out
Porsche truck super sport, take it to my partner's house

Just stepped out fresh out the shower
Gotta stay fresh take about an hour
Gotta get dressed your boy’s so clean
Both of em' off, I got them blue jeans

Fresh pair of shades, house on my wrists
Socks to the drawers your boy stay fit
I’m ready, can't nobody tell me nothing

I'm so fly, so fly
Feels like I’m taking off
I'm so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off

So fly, so fly
Feels like I'm taking off
I'm so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off

Got my keys, picked my toy
Top drop down, let the haters hear the noise
Hit that paddle turn that wheel
Push that run make it all disappear
