So many times I've walked this way, too many times from You
I've strayed, fallen way behind to my former state of mind
I look around what do I see, so many strugglin' just like me
Tryin' to live this life, falling down to compromise
But then I have a question, is that what we're living for?
Aren't we called to perfection, to strive for so much more
I find that we have settled too many times
Should not be so, I think it's time God's letting us know
We need to get it right

Make the dope boy smile, they don't need binoculars

My life is in His hands,
And I'm not worried about my sorrows

Gives me strength when I need it
Supply out weighs demand
So when I call upon His name
I know my life won't be the same
Oh protect me from my friends oh Lord, and I will watch

Those who wanna eat upon my flesh, protect me from
those foes
Here I am at Your service, oh almighty God
And if I call upon Your name I know my life won't be the

Not she rid the things could not remain the same
I hope you find a lot of nice things out there
Now the memory is all we share
I tell you again girl you know I care
You just let me know and I'll be there

Now it seems like only yesterday
Since you gone away
But then another day goes by
I never meant to make you sad
Or ever treat you bad
I never wanted to see you cry
I should have been there for you
To see this through
The regrets always on my mind
Now it's too late for you
To turn around, oh girl
And see what you've left behind

Now she gone
No words could explain the pain
That my feeling
You're forever on my brain

Go, go, go

The way you say it
Got me feeling like I'm fading
The way you do it
Got me wishing we were taken
You got that bad, bad love
And I just can't get enough
And I know my friends sayin', "girl, stay away"
But I like what I like I
I eat that bad, bad love
I breathe that bad, bad love
I need your bad, bad

I'm a hit the club, hit the weed
Hit the Gin then hit the track
Poppin' bottle, buy the bar
Before I came thru I had to hit the bank
Always toss a bitch or 2
You know, that's what trippy niggas do
30 girls in the V.I.P.
Got you, pussy niggas spooked
Still hood, now I can buy the hood, my bitch bad, she fuck good
Walk around all through the town,
I wish one of you hatin' niggas would
Life of a millionaire, on the way to be a billionaire
All I like is stripper poles and white hoes in their underwear

Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'
Here comes the bottles tell me what you're drankin'
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
Cause tonight I need some entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad,
From the car to the crib
'Cause tonight I need some entertainment

Everything I do is dope, you would think I was a crack dealer
Big money, fast cars
Hoes all in my lap niggas

You're charged with possess in other people property
Yes, your honor
I'm guilty of "trudge"
But you know what?!
Let me tell you a story, alright! Yo-yo-yo!

[Chorus]
She wanna be down

And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown
She do what I say
And I would never ever lead her a stray.
She wanna be down
With me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown
Today is going away
So your grind, it is the road that I play

[Verse 1]
That's why me go stop that
Cause the boy left the gal

Mash up everything pon all the shelf & work-not.

And when she a beg stop
Still put it on cause dutty never yet flop

We done know the bed
Make her move to the desktop
And all the little rest pot

But you never feared, always prepared to share

Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin' yo

Sipping Hennesy an we'll be bubblin' yo
Set your mind at ease we got to take it slow

So when you see the S.P. floating don't provoke him
Cause the girls we be poking ganja smoking
Best thing for the recreation to get the best girls in every nation
Topper girls we promotin' and supportin'
And them love how we flow king hear them shouting
First class ticket invitation girls from New York, England and Jamaican

We be earnin' dollars turning cause we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds - girls, we need them everyday
Recognize it, we pimpin' as we riding

True me write enough tune and drive them crazy
Well I man a true born Jamaican
Ready for the girls them in a every situation

"Hold On"
Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now now
Hold on and believe
Though we already won
We'll still hold on

Hold on, hold on now now

Finish line I'll see you there
I know you're well prepared
Put aside all your fears

Might seem that no one cares
Been working hard for years
Keep climbing up the stairs
Gotta know that you already there
Blood sweat and the tears now
None of them can take your cheers now
Enemies better be aware now
Champions got a lot to bear now
I'ma tell you this

I'ma swear you now

Eye of the tiger

Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe it's gonna be lit tonight

Baby girl yuh a carry ten ton a fatness gimme some a dat
Pink sweetie badness, look how she hot
She a black goddess, but tell her don't stop
It's a good piece of mentals under the cap
Hot piece of gear, mami love how you talk
Watching every step, I dip upon what you got
Stayin' in my brain, I'm 'membering all the touch?
And my aim is to give you this love

Hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie or play you
Beam me up like Scottie
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, complain to you
Pull so hypnotic

gyal we never miss
Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss (no lie, no lie)
Hypnotized, pull another one
It's alright, I know what you want
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss (no lie)

It's always how we do it (no lie)

So many times I've walked this way, too many times from You
I've strayed, fallen way behind to my former state of mind
I look around what do I see, so many strugglin' just like me
Tryin' to live this life, falling down to compromise
But then I have a question, is that what we're living for?
Aren't we called to perfection, to strive for so much more
I find that we have settled too many times
Should not be so, I think it's time God's letting us know
We need to get it right

Take another step on towards my destiny.

Deep ina mi brain inna mi soul I hold the key.

Throughout all life and beyond all eternity.

Sit and remember all the things that we spoke of,
All of the serious reasonings an all di tings we make jokes of.

But those who pull the trigger cannot take away.
The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah.
So I know I'll see you again my brother.

'Til you give it away

We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change

Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on

Just smile, and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two

Can't keep up wit di trend, man, I left it

Bad man nuh sorry 'cuz we done hit di cherry
Done legendary nuff gal wife he marry
One ting wi hafi tell dem necessary
Big up unu self if unu got it

From a gal nuh up to date, wi deport dem
Can't keep up wit di trends, wi report dem
If I nuh di modelin' type, wi nuh court dem
But if I di big beauty queen, wi support dem

Again, if a woman nuh up to date, wi deport dem
Can't keep up wit di trends, wi report dem

And shawty went down then she went low
Gave it to her badder that she in a relay
The craziest thing is she don't know
How beautiful she is everyday

Look at you in that dress
