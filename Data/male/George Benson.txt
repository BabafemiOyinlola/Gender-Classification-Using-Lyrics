Things just ain't been right since you've been gone
'Til the end of time we've taken a vow to 
Keep our family strong 
But we were both tryin' to grow in our own direction 
Soon the magic of two meant nothing at all 

So don't you think it's 'bout time (It's 'bout time)
We had a family reunion (Make things right)
Cause I'm losin' my mind (All my mind)
Without you here in my life (In my life)

I need to know it's not for show and the way you look is just not fair.
I know yous trying to pretend getting closer to the end. It's just start all over again.

(Chorus1)
Show me the love that you gave. When I looked into your eyes. It's like a little piece of heaven in my soul.
Show me the love that we had. I'm remembering the night you came into my life now I need you to show me the love.

Past the minutes on its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

Like a tunnel that you follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone

Halter top with the capri pants on

And pretty feet which is a fetish of mine

Until she heard me say

And I come and possibly
Can I take you out tonight

Blinded by the double standard

You said, "It's not too late to get it back"

If I knew back then what I know now
If I understood the what, when, why and how
Now it's clear to me
What I should have done
But hindsight is 20/20 vision

Always taking you for granted
I never saw it from your point of view
Blinded by the double standard

You were tryin' to tell me all along
Something in the love was missing
You said, "It's not too late to get it back"
But I just wasn't listening

If I knew back then what I know now
If I understood the what, when, why and how
Now it's clear to me
What I should have done
But hindsight is 20/20 vision

Across the ocean, across the sea,

Need to see your face,

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now

I have never been so much
In love, in love before
What a difference
How true love made in my life
So nice and so right
Lovers come and then lovers go

Don't they know
How it feels when you love me
Hold me and say you care

I think I finally know you
I can see beyond your smile
I think that I can show you
That what we have is still worthwhile
Don't you know that love's just like the thread
That keeps unravelling but then
It ties us back together in the end

In your eyes, I can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes, found the answers to my questions

I remember the days when we never had a dime
And our dreams seemed a million miles away
But we made it baby, facin' the bad times with a smile
Here we are and we're growin' stronger day by day

'Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good
To know you're by my side

'Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love
To keep us satisfied every night

So my lady whisper the words I love to hear
Cuddle up and I'll make you feel all right
'Cause I need you baby to carry me on through all the years
So come on baby close the door and dim the lights

You've got to say what's on your mind, don't be afraid to show it
Say what's on your mind or how will I know it?
There's so little time, say what's on your mind

The last time we were together, such a sadness in your eyes
Behind the poise, small talk and make-up, I could see what you labored so hard to disguise
What we both know; there's so much that's unsaid, though we try not to let it show
Too many words go unspoken now, we sit in silence and don't ask why
Come on baby, we can't let this time roll by

Say what's on your mind, don't wait another day

Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues and hit the city lights
Cause there's music in the air and lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night
You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world coming out to dance
'Cause there's music in the air and lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night
So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?
Just give me the night (all right, tonight)
Give me the night

I remember the days when we never had a dime
And our dreams seemed a million miles away
But we made it baby, facin' the bad times with a smile
Here we are and we're growin' stronger day by day

'Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good
To know you're by my side

'Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love
To keep us satisfied every night

So my lady whisper the words I love to hear
Cuddle up and I'll make you feel all right
'Cause I need you baby to carry me on through all the years
So come on baby close the door and dim the lights

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, whoa)
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Money's tight, he's workin' every night
It ain't easy to keep the flame alive
And when he finally comes home to ya
He's just too tired to do the things you want to

You can't help but wonder to yourself
How would it be with someone else
Just keep in mind, every storm ends in time
Love is forever, stay together

(Stay together) When you got something real
(Love forever) That you may never feel again

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, whoa)
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Livin' life without you, girl, is alright
If you really want to know
I'd have to say it's dangerous to my mind

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Let me love you all the time
Lady, love me

Yes, I'm askin' you to stay
Remembering it used to be so right
If you're askin' for the truth
I'd have to say I won't believe it's goodnight

But you just don't understand
Girl, you've been charging by the hour

I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believing in romance
You're taking way too many chances
With my love

I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around

Without the woman I can make it
But I need the girl to stay
Oh, don't you let the lady take it
All away
When the woman needs

And when we met
Out on the streets along the way
It wasn't by chance that we
Were passing by that day
As sure as there's a moon
And stars above I know
We'll be together for sure
As sure as that nose on your face
We were meant for each other's arms

Your smile is mesmerizin'
And soothes me like sweet wine

(Ooh) With you is where it's warmer
I never want to leave
So come on, girl, let's closer
I want to breathe when you breathe

You make me shiver
Girl, your love is such a sweet sensation, ho, ho

You stare at him at night and think of schemes
I stay with her each night but you're in my dreams
You tellin' him that you're goin' out just to meet some friends
I wonder if this treachery will ever ever end

We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair

You have a little boy, you really love
I have a little daughter that I place no one above
If by chance you see me walkin down the street

I see myself in your face
A reflection of pain
Somebody made you
Cry over and over again
Still you and I made it
Through all of this for a reason
Yes, we did
Could it be that we created
Affair for all seasons
'Cause you and I
Were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us
There's no other
We're finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together, we'll mend
All the cracks in our heart

We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way

I think I finally know you
I can see beyond your smile
I think that I can show you
That what we have is still worthwhile
Don't you know that love's just like the thread
That keeps unravelling but then
It ties us back together in the end

In your eyes, I can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes, found the answers to my questions

I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way

Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody is searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be

When cabs don't drive around the park
No windows light the summer dark
When love has lost its secret spark
