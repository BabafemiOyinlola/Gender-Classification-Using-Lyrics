Can you feel it, baby

Excuse me
Do you think that I might be able to touch you

I can tell you how I feel about you nite and day
How I feel about you, no, no
I can tell you how I feel about you nite and day
How I feel about you

I'll love you more in the rain or shine
And makin' love in the rain is fine
A love so good and I call it mine
Love is blind

How I feel about you, no, no, no
I can tell you how I feel about you nite and day

"Girl, you could careless,
If we're in public, or we're all, alone,
Oooo girl, when it's on, it's on,
Still bein' difficult, as you want,
Even though, you're dead wrong,
Girl, I don't wanna jump the gun, & head, out the do-or,
My eard-rums, can't take no more, & I'm so tired of,
All, the neighbors, bangin', on the floor."

"Awake me when you're done,
Screaming at from the top of your lungs,
Like I was ten miles, away from the sun,
You're makin', this love, into a project,
Your attitude, takes away all the fun, (Oooo, girl wake me-e)
Awake me when you're done,
Screaming at from the top of your lungs,
You make me wanna shout, "That we're done!",
& Then I look at your face,
& memories make me wana come,
Come back home, to you, (Come back home Mmmhmm-mm),
Come back home, to you, (Come back home).

There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady, our love will shine, lighting the light
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise, now is the time
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel all right

And, baby, through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right

And, baby, through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life

Can I talk to you?
I think you need to hear what I've got to say
So please listen

I've prayed for better days, days when you and I'd be closer
My mind focused on treating you right and not searching for wrong
But wrong love would be the final words and suffering draw the curtains
And the show would last till life was gone
And we'd exchange these simple words

I wanna open up to you and tell you what I've been through
Want you to open up to me and share with me a dream

Listen,
All our friends are breaking up
Cause they don't never talk things through
All they ever do is making love
Being without you just ain't cool
You're my baby and I'm feeling you
There's no place I'd rather be
Than wrapped up in your arms tonight
Just you and me

Only you could love me the way you do
Only you would put up with the things I do (yes you would, know you would)

Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Show the love that we share
I'll relax you places he wouldn't dare!

It's all in shades how I really feel
I won't play, I won't ever ever mess around
Can't you see oh how much I really love you?
They try to say that you're too old for me
...but they don't understand

[Hook:]
It's all in shades of grey, yes I do love ya'
You've been touched before...
...But this means so much more
...

Understand! Alright can you feel it baby?
'Cause I work...'ya know what I'm saying?
Alright, let's go...!

[Hook:]
I never have no private times (I never)
I think I'm going to lose my mind for sure!
Ooh I never have no private times (I never)
I think I'm going to lose my mind for sure!

There was a time I'd never be alone
(He's always with someone)
Never have no private times
(Or never even peace of mind)
I just want to have someone (So please y'all)
Just forget the "Rescue Me" yeah... oh!

[Bridge:]
I never thought I would say this before
Understand I'm just chillin' by myself

(Yo, you Eddie check this out here)
Why is it every time I see your face
It's only when I got gas in my Chevy?
There's something strange about that
What's up?
(It's just a)

Missunderstanding, I'm not so demanding
Never will you play with my heart
Missunderstanding, I don't know
What you're planning
Never will you tear me apart

I know I must be dreaming
All these brand new friends
And I've never seen such clever ways
To make amends, you never know
Who's scheming, is she out for self?
Nowadays you've got to be protected
And it's not for health

Don't you know she drives me crazy
Does she like my walk or maybe
All she knows is that money talks
(Money, money, money)

It's a shame the way it is
I really like her smile
I'd like to get to know her
'Cause she drives me wild

Aw yeah-now that ain't Al B. Sure!

[Hook:]
'Ya know I always see the lady
She drives me crazy all night
Except my baby doesn't know
I need to have that special lady
Channel J might break her heart
If I ever left my baby I'd never be the same
ya' know

Excuse me if I stop to stare at your body
So fly I don't understand
How could one woman be blessed with so much?
Are you single my lady? I'll be your man!

Girl don't make me promises you can't keep
Promises are conferred to fools
Come straight ahead you know the time
It's you on my mind (that one day you'd know)

I Back, Black

[Rap:]
Yo this is Al B.
I own a masion and a yacht
so get a calculator so you can calculate what I got.
Save the deficit by giving my milk money to the legislature
Word Up my daily major.
Play the role real smooth like Humphrey Bogie.
Got more loot than any man could show me.
This song may sound strange.
So drop the chump change.
I keep my Money, don't shoot it up in my veins.
On the list I insist as U drown in the abyss.
Of Rolex platinum joints and don't point.
Shes such a sad little story...
Who drives a candy apple Delorean Red.
Full injected with money and tuned up with cash.
Cause thats a flam young man.
Arrogant enough to egotistically display.

Yeah, alright

Just for the moment, just for the moment
Don't ya know I tried so hard to please?
Just for the moment, just for the moment

The way we first me, it happened so fast
I thought too soon but I hoped it would last
I didn't know you and yet we still made love
We rushed into things but it was Heaven above

I know you were not sincere, you were not sincere
I know you were not sincere, 'cause if you loved me
I know you'd be here, you'd be here with me

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place (background)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California

Chorus:
Oooh this love is so
Umm, that I won't let you go
Oooh this love is so
Umm, that I won't let you go

Taking the time to show my love for you, no
Do you love me too girl?

That out love can't help grow
Because the passion you bring to me, my lady

And if a petal should fall
I'll catch your heart for you

I heard she sang a good song
I heard she had a style
And so I came to see her
To listen for a while

And there she was
This young girl
A stranger to my eyes

[CHORUS:]
Strumming my pain
With her fingers
She was singing
My life with her words
Killing me softly
With her song
Killing me softly
With her song
Telling my whole life
With her words
Killing me softly
With her song

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby

I'm just a man
Who comes around at night
And to leave you, girl
Baby, that ain't right

You call me over
Give me sexy talk
After things are over
You tell me take a walk, girl

If you think
I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one
Who's loving you the most, girl

Material things
Don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend, yeah
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

Since this conversation
I'm so confused
