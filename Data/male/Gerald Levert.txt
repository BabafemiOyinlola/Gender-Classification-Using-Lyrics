If you want the pleasure
You need strength to take the pain
And on your way to sanity
You'll sometimes feel insane

You have been so sure there was no cure
So you and I?
And did not even try to
Found out why we've not got far

If you want the function
better learn to ignore the fault
And what you call normality

Baby it's time, for me,
To give you all the love you need.

And I just ain't been givin' you my time.
But girl I wanna give you, every little bit, every little piece, every little part of me,

It's written all over your face
You don't have to say a word
Just smile a smile a smile
A smile for me
It's better than any word I ever heard

I know that I'm a very lucky guy
To have someone like you
I never met a girl in my life like you before
You make all my dreams come true

I love the way you carry you
You have a lot of class and good taste
And you don't have to say how much you care for me
Because it's written all over your face

Girl, I love you so
I promise you I'll never let you go
Till the end of time
You will always be forever mine, baby
We will share our joy
We'll care and understand each other, boy
A love that's built on trust
I'll never love again, you're the only one
You give me all that I need
And I can't get you out of my mind
We have the love everyone wants
And we know it's real, 'cause the way we feel
It was so hard to find
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Our love is strong and stronger we'll get
Like a hand in glove, nothing's closer than this
That's what love is
(Oh oh, baby oh)
Your touch, your tender kiss
Your smile I can't resist
No one can love me better
Until the end of time we'll be together
You're a special part of me

Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Gerald
Just this morning I took a stroll through your garden
I watched the sunrise and it made me think of you
The way you talk to the flowers and make them grow
And in the middle of all these flowers
There's one single stem red rose
It stood out from the rest the fairest of them all
It made me think of what you asked me
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Lady your body moves like poetry
Like a diamond in the raw
You shine for me
No one else can hold her hand up to you girl
Cause you're everything I need in my world lady

How can I express
My apology to you
I know I better pay
For all the things I put you through

Lying 'bout my whereabouts
I don't even take you out no more
So it wasn't a surprise to me
When I found my clothes outside the door

Before you put me out
Girl, please understand
I ain't nothin' special
I am just a man
Who loves you with all my heart
But I didn't use my head
I swear that I'll be back, girl
So just keep it warm
On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed

I know how I would feel
If you went astray
Thinking 'bout somebody lovin' you
Better than I do, girl would make me go insane

Can I have a kiss goodbye
And I'll be on my way

Men At Large- So Alone

We were together just the other day
Taking life for granted, passing time away
I was there for you, you were there for me
We would be together for eternity
I never knew there'll be sorrow
But I knew we'd be together tomorrow
Together forever we were so wrong
Now, I just can't believe that you're gone

And I'm so alone, alone
You never miss a good thing till it's gone
And I'm so alone, I'm so alone yes I am
I really can't believe that you're gone, gone, gone

Life goes on and it's not the same
Cause I can't help sometimes calling out your name
But, then I realize that you won't come around, no
Oh, what I wouldn't give to see your smile
Oh, yes, we've had our ups and downs
Oh, what I wouldn't do to have you cussing me out
I know it sounds funny, but what can I say
My life just ain't the same since you went away

And I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
You never miss a good thing till it's gone (gone)
And I'm so alone, (ooh) did you have to go away
I really miss you

Crazy, I used to call it crazy
When my friends used to be
All confiding in me 'bout their girl
See, I never understood
How any real man could
Let a woman come in
To change and shake up their world, uh no

Tryin' to find some peace within
But here ain't no rest for a weary man

Looking everywhere just to find a smile
Then the phone rings and an angel sings

And it's funny you should call today
You always found a way to make my day

Out the door, starts to pour, gotta make it there
In a blur, there you were, couldn't shake you, baby

And I know it was true when I saw it drippin' from your body
Baby I had to step to you
And the rain made it sexy, too

I forgot about the raindrops
The cloudy day went away, saw your face
Forgot the raindrops

Love in the rain never appealed to me
But seeing you just brought a change in me
Just then and there, oh what a fantasy, baby

It was storming, it was pouring, girl
You were so fine, felt like sunshine

And he was extremely proud and anxious for everyone to hear his newest collection. It is with his wish and mine that I proudly present the one you all nicknamed "The Teddy Bear", my son, Gerald Levert and his new album "In My Songs".

I'm tired of waking up with nobody laying next to me (next to me)
I'm tired of being alone and everybody else is lovey dovey (lovey dovey)

Although you've got me hypnotized
My heart is unnecessarily over beating
"Let's take our time at going out"
you said "just wait and see"
I wonder now if you had ever felt the same as me

Fall back 'cause I'm running away from the attack

She deserves the finer things in life
The best clothes best cars best love best wines
And if you can give her that she'll give her lovin back
To somebody whos gonna treat her like a queen
Show her what love really means
And if you know its really love you can never get enough of love

I will stress to the death for m lady
Be a freak never cheat on m lady
Go to work go to church with m lady

I know, I know
You're trying to save yourself baby

I'm not wrong
For stopping by, for staying tonight
'Cause the only thing to do
Could be for me to seduce you baby

Kissin', huggin'
We can do it through the day
I yearn for you
Every moment you're away

Caught up
Can't think, feelings so deep
Tell me babe
Is this the way to heaven?

And you're next to me
Wouldn't you be strong 'cause I'm so weak

You know sometimes we can seem to take things for granted
Especially the things that are there all the time
But sometimes you gotta sit back and realize that
Some people aren't so fortunate
You know they aren't so blessed to have someone they can talk to
Somebody they can sit with and say
I'll always be there for you
I love you, I got your back

Aw girl, what's up? Aw, not again
So you're packin' your bags
And you're leaving? But that ain't right
You need to stay awhile, think about it
But wait a minute, before you go

There's just one thing I want you to know

We both agree that this love
Ain't what it used to be, we just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you, baby
Girl, you'll always be my heart
It's gonna to be strange living without you

Ain't felt so empty before, no
See, I miss your smile
And even your fussin'

Oh, baby, say now

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine
That's your way
You always walked a step behind

See, I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain, no

Did you ever know that you're my hero
You're everything I would like to be
I could fly higher than an eagle
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But daddy, daddy, daddy I've got it all
Right here in my heart, yes I do say

Standing all alone, there I'd be dying

Come home asking for forgiveness, please
You just want to see me on my knees
Baby, you know I'm too cool for that
But I tell my soul to get you back

Girl, I'll do it if I have to
'Cause I'm sorry that I hurt you, baby
Can we talk and stay?

Ain't no sunshine since you've been gone
Only rain, pain, and cloudy days spent all alone
If I could turn back time, I swear that it would be
The way it was when I was down for you
And you was down for me

Let no temptations
Get a hold of me

Everything will be everything

No more, I love you, no jealousy

Said you had a few problems
You knew you were wrong

When I started peepin' you makin' eyes at my boo
Goin' out your way to be all up in her face
Me and her would be in bed doin' what we do

Showed me all the differences
Between a woman and a girl
Right then I knew I could be a good man
With you inside my world, my world, my world

I don't need to take a toke

Everybody's blowing smoke

Friends say that we in a pinch
They're just hatin' their lies

All of life's finer things
Like rainbows and shining stars
Baby, you are

Here's a robe; take off your clothes, hmmmmmm
Take my hand the waters running baby in the bubble bath, candles everywhere
Relax and unwind. I'm a wash your back while you take a sip of this red wine

Welcome to my lair, lair, lair, lair, this is where we play girl
It's on baby, promise you we won't stop no, no. Till you know your G Spot.
It aint nothing but love for you baby; My lair, this is where we play baby,
It's my playground. We'll be getting down

Rub your shoulders, kiss your neck;
Roll my tongue down your back

oh babe
tell me you don't have to go
tell me you can stay
that you'll do it another night
another night, you see
I never thought that you
could do the things you do
to make my nature rise through the wee hours of the night
you got me all shook up thinking i'm in love
i'm usually the one making my lover grind
when i'm inside
but you brought tears to my eyes
surprise surprise
1 - oh, what a night we had, girl

Hoo... ooh... babe

Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby

When did you stop lovin' me
What did I do so wrong
That you had to leave
When did you stop wantin' me
No letters, no call
Girl, you know I'm needy

Baby, this thing has took its toll
On my mind, my body, and soul, baby

Can't get you out of system
Out of my head
Out of my future
Out of my bed

I hear your name
I see your face
I lose all composure

Yeah yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah

Forcast was cloudy, the chance of showers
I had places to be, folks to see in about an hour
Out the door, starts to pour, gotta make it there
In a blur, there you were, couldn't shake you, baby

They say a little water won't hurt nobody
And I know it was true when I saw it drippin' from your body
Baby I had to step to you
And the rain made it sexy, too

1 - I saw you, you saw me
I forgot about the raindrops
The cloudy day went away, saw your face
Forgot the raindrops

Love in the rain never appealed to me
But seeing you just brought a change in me
Just then and there, oh what a fantasy, baby
You soakin' wet and laying next to me

It was storming, it was pouring, girl
You were so fine, felt like sunshine

Sometimes my ego get's in the way I don't say I love you when I should say it
ain't your fault I had a bad day for your happiness is why I pray now I lay me

remember all these words I say

Your smile your face is all that it take's is all that it take's to humble me

oh huh
Just got laid off from work today
I can't go home
What am I gonna say
Guess I'll go to the local bar toss up a few
Tell the bartender what I'm going thru
He said if you got a good woman
She gon catch you when you fall
So instead of giving me an earful
here's a quarter you need to call her
So here I am baby

If tonight I cry (oh baby)
I need you to be strong

Catchin' feelings

I'm catchin' feelings, I'm catchin' feelings
I don't think I can deal with hollering at you and you not holler back
Leaving messages on your phone and you don't hit me back

Catchin' feelings, I'm catchin' feelings
I don't think I can deal with knowing you're laying up with somebody else
I don't want you for my friend if I can't have you for myself

A friend of a friend introduced us, had some drinks and some laughs
Told me about your man, I told you 'bout my girlfriend
You said he made you happy sometimes
But he spends way too much time at work

And his family worked yo' nerves, baby
Momma was a jerk and his kissing was the worse
But you still loved him, so we agreed to meet next week
For conversation and some drinks

But baby girl, I think I'm catchin' feelings, I'm catchin' feelings

It ain't the sunny day that makes my nature rise, no
It's you, babe
The feeling I get when I look into your eyes, ooh
What you do to me, said

I need your body baby but tell me what to do
I'll follow your lead when trying to get you
To come to me, comfort me, let me see ecstasy
All that matters is you loving me

It ain't the apple pie that fills my appetite, no
It's better
It ain't the young girl that we just seen walking by
Don't sweat it baby, no

Girl, it ain't nothing 'bout my favorite song, no, no

It's how you get me coming back for your love
Baby, it's longer

And it's so funny 'cause it brings back old memories

You said I was in too deep
You said I was too serious
And girl you broke my heart
When you broke it off between the two of us
Now it's a shame and now you wanna come back

I can't give you my private line
'Cause you be calling me all the time
A year ago would have been fine
Now I gotta give you my service line
You can call me anytime

I never thought that I would get over you
You left me broken down lonely, sad and blue
And it's a shame and now you wanna come back

Ain't it funny baby that you wanna come back

In my new life
I met plenty of girls
But none that make me wanna do
The things you make me do, said that

I wanna learn
What makes you feel good
See Lord knows I tried to keep you satisfied
The best way I could, baby

See no woman
Has laid love down on me
The way that you laid it on me

Keep on laying it on me, baby
And I wanna learn all the things
To keep you occupied
I wanna give you my time, baby

See, you be the teacher
I won't be the fool, baby (I won't be no fool baby)

And I'm ready for school

You ca be the principal
I'll follow the rules

Can nobody tell us so, “How to do nothin’”
I know you’ve been hurt before when you needed good lovin’
Come, baby, come here, baby, let me show you something

Honey, sugar, sweet, come in, love
Chillin' in the back seat makin’ love
Can’t nobody tell nobody what we do with our grown bodies
My body all over your body, slip away

Why do we stay here? Let’s slip away, dear

Why don’t they mind their own business?
Why don’t they leave mine alone?
Why don’t they get a life of their own?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

People are talkin’, talkin’ ‘bout people
I hear them whisper, you won’t believe it, baby
They think we’re lovers kept undercover
I just ignore it but they keep sayin’

We laugh just a little too loud
We stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long
Maybe they’re seeing something we don’t see, darlin’

Let’s give ‘em something to talk about
(Something to talk about)
A little mystery to figure out
(Something to talk about)
Let’s give ‘em something to talk about
How about love, love, love, love?

I feel so foolish I never noticed

Ooh, well, well, well
Well, well, well

Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side?
I maybe climbing on rainbows
But, baby, here it goes, here it goes

Dreams are for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you’re wondering what this song is leading to
I wanna make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

No, you don’t know me well
And every little thing only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
Then we’ll see it through together, baby

And he was extremely proud and anxious for everyone to hear his newest collection. It is with his wish and mine that I proudly present the one you all nicknamed "The Teddy Bear", my son, Gerald Levert and his new album "In My Songs".

You know sometimes in the heat of the moment
You say some things that you really don't mean
Last night I've said some things that I know cut like a knife
You try to cut me back, I just want all of this to stop
I wanna kiss and make up

Sugar, I want you to know that
I didn't mean a thing that I said last night
And baby, deep inside I know
You didn't mean those things you said about me last night

So let stuff of the past be the past
Don't go to sleep being mad
On the couch, on the floor, take my hand
Let's be lovers, not fighters no more

Gerald Levert - Soul Mate

Verse 1
Everyone needs someone they can talk to
If it's fine with you they would walk through
with no hesitation be there
they care for you
And everyone needs someone they can run to
In the nick of time they are
sure to come through
Cause they have your best interest at heart
Their part, part of you
Chorus
We all need a soul mate
Someone to hold
when the nights become cold
Someone to love
We all need a soul mate

But now you're laying next to me
Your conversation stimulates

You grab the oil from the night stand
Music's playing as you rub it in, ooh
I hate to think this has to end
You hush me up, it's just the beginning, ooh

Alright, you win
I know, I'll never love this way again
You told me that your loving was a sleeper

You kiss is like a cotton candy
Ooh, so soft and you look so sweet
And I must say, your foreplay

took the steps to meet someone who
would change my life.

Cuz, I was made to love ya/my hands

Go to sleep made at each other, no baby
And girl we said, ain't gonna be no secrets keep between
One another no, no, no, no

For three days or so
Girl, you been dogging me strong
And it ain't that time of the month
That excuse don't work, don't front

Like you thought about, the good the bad,
The times we laughed, when we were sad,
I think about, your mom and dad, and your family

But no matter how far
You'll be in my heart
And wherever you are you should know
That you're forever loved
Forever joy, forever girl, I'm your forever boy

Right then I knew I could be a good man
With you inside my world, my world, my world

I don't need to take a toke
'Cuz I'm on a natural high
Everybody's blowing smoke
But girl you never lie
Friends say that we in a pinch
They're just hatin' their lies
I know they want what I got
It comes once in a lifetime, yeah

You're the reason why I sing
All of life's finer things
Like rainbows and shining stars
Baby, you are
You're the reason why I sing

And you nourished me, encouraged me
'Till I grew tall as a tree, as a tree
