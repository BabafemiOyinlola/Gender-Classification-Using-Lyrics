Drugs got me sweating, but the room getting colder
Looking at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight?
I don't know, is it over?
Looking for my next high
I'm looking for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Drugs got me sweating, but the room getting colder
Looking at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Looking for my next high, I'm looking for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead (cough)
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out of my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in

But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

What's the 27 Clu-u-u-ub?

Damn, that's the world we live in now

Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse

These niggas really want me dead
I don't really think they that lucky (C'mon)
I told my bitch I love her (I did)
I hope she think I mean it (Whoa)
I wouldn't lie about that shit, trust me (At all)
I wouldn't lie about street shit, trust me (At all)
I wouldn't lie about drug shit, trust me (Oh no)
See that drug shit hide the ugly (Oh no)
And I ain't never been ugly, trust me (Oh no)
Dicked up in her brain, concussion (Uh-huh)
We had a Snoop Dogg discussion (We did)
A sexual eruption (Smash)

Open up them legs, I'm hungry
Bank account eruptin' (Yeah)
I need me a safe or something (Yeah)
I'm a dirt bike riding junkie (C'mon)
I don't need that Wraith for nothing (Let's go)
But it's a Wraith on my wrist or somethin' (Skrrt)
Hoes wanna rape my wrist or somethin' (All white)
Cops wanna raid my crib for nothing (Uh)
Just 'cause we black

That's how they comin' (Fuck 12, fuck 12, fuck 12)
Chasing the lean, rotting my brain, honestly
Drugs the only thing that's faithful to me, sorry to say
Groupie hoes wanna come my way
Come take this pic and get out my face
That champagne glass on my kitchen counter

Pop a bean time 'cause it ain't killing me

Too busy making money, to worry 'bout making memories
