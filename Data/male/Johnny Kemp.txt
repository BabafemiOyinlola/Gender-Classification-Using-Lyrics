All ways you sure look sweet
Fine young lady standin' by
Come on baby, sweet eye delight, hey!

I like the way that you move
And you look so sweet when you're movin' to the beat
I'm tired of all these boring parties

When I came by, I was hopin' you were home
You smiled and let me in
I told you that I need a shoulder to cry on
You gave me yours again
You said it's gonna be all right, And turned off the lights
In the darkness you held me tight and,
One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
The best of friends can be lovers after all
I checked the time, it's gettin' late, I've gotta go

Tellin' my kid just what 2 do

Feeling Without Touching

Johnny Kemp

I never knew that we could feel without touching
I never knew that we could speak without talking
Some strange and wonderful feelings, girl, has
happened to me
It's so hard to explain but I know that it's real

I never knew that we could feel without touching
I never knew that we could speak without talking

Just thinking about you alone in my room
But I feel your love it's surrounding me
Everywhere I go I take you with me

Especially at night I feel so close to you
...

When I see your smile each mornin'
It makes me feel so good
I love to love you baby
I look into your eyes that glow
It gives me more than you can know
I love to love you baby

I hold you in my arms so tight
Your feeling is so very right
While holdin' hands or makin' love
Our love was sent from high above
My love for you is like a sea
That showers the flowers in all the trees
It sets me free just like a bird
It's just like flyin'

Love is like a beautiful smile
Love is like a look in your eyes
Love is like a wonderful dream
It's just like flyin'
Love is like a beautiful smile
Love is like a look in your eyes
Love is like a wonderful dream
It's just like flyin' yeah

Ooh baby, it's just like flyin'

Have mercy on my eyes
Lady, what'cha wearin now?
You know it's a crime
The way you look in clothes
Girl you take the prize
Five foot five and dressed to kill
Strike my fancy every time
You strike a pose

There's one more outfit
That I ain't seen yet
One more outfit
That looks great I bet

I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit
I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit
You've got your best feature
Straight from Mother Nature
Now I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit

Got so many shoes

We've been together for quite sometime
i remain yours exclusively
and though i never want to tie you down
i'm into private property
(i'm leaving you 'till you do decide)
i wanna be the only one
(hoping that you'll be only mine)
'cause i don't wanna be
(just another lover)
tell me girl i wanna know you i turn you on
am i just another lover
say i'm like no other
i wanna be your number one
We started out so casual
you didn't take it serious
but in my heart and in my soul
it's always been the two of us
so we give that question to me
you know that you're the only one
brought with me into ecstasy
oh, so i don't have to be
