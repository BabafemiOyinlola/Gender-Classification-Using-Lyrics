You had me stuck off the realness, fearless The head was sick, I call that mental illness Maybe I'm crazy, singing to myself Looking in the mirror, pointing fingers at myself  Here was you, living off me Smoking loud, speaking softly Now I'm in the car, singing off-key like: "I'm just saying you can do better"  I'm heated, I can't say that I'm chilling Ain't feeling what you say if you won't say what you're feeling now Take the words back and think them through The songs on the radio might be about you  Why am I thinking of you after all you've done Why's my heart fighting for you when my mind wants you gone Held on for too long, oh, oh, oh I've heard it before, I'm singing the same old story now  When I used to hear from SWV and En Vogue Mary J.
