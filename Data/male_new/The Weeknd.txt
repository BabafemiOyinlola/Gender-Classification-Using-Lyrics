I realized, I belong to you I feel the darkness, I run away from you  Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed I learned to love you, the way you need 'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same  I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing  I was too busy tryna find you with someone else The one I couldn't stand, to be with was myself ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
The reasons I can't have you, are so easy to fix I didn't really plan to, but I'ma do it for this The reasons I can't have you, isn't so complicated Baby if you let me I won't hesitate  All I know, all I know is this All I know, all I know is this All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)  I know there's been stigma around me I know you heard things about me You sleep one eye closed Too scared to get heartbroke Heard too many lies told Don't make this shit unfold I could tell why you would doubt me I hit one time, you can't live without me Girl I'm just peaking, I'm just tryna be on top of you On top of you  All I know All I know, all I know, all I know All I know is this All I know, all I know, all I know All I know All I know, all I know, all I know All I know is this All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know... ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
I'm findin' ways to articulate The feeling I'm goin' through I just can't say I don't love you 'Cause I love you, yeah It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold But tonight I'm gon' let you know Let me tell the truth Baby let me tell the truth, yeah  You know what I'm thinkin' See it in your eyes You hate that you want me Hate it when you cry You're scared to be lonely 'Specially in the night I'm scared that I'll miss you Happens every time I don't want this feelin' I can't afford love I try to find reason to pull us apart It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect And I know that you're worth it I can't walk away, oh!  Even though we're going through it If it makes you feel alone ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
Tell me what you really like Baby I can take my time We don't ever have to fight Just take it step-by-step I can see it in your eyes Cause they never tell me lies I can feel that body shake And the heat between your legs  You've been scared of love and what it did to you You don't have to run, I know what you've been through Just a simple touch and it can set you free We don't have to rush when you're alone with me  I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe  You are not the single type So baby, this the perfect time I'm just trying to get you high And faded off this touch You don't need a lonely night So baby, I can make it right ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
They start rumors about anything They wanna ruin us and get crazy They talking reckless then the ones i know I see them hatin' and now I get taller My baby I just wanna get love found I look at you and now I get taller I see that you gon' work your tempo I may go out tomorrow, may stay low  They wanna, they wanna, they wanna They wanna, they wanna, they wanna Make love to, make love to, make love to, one love They wanna, they wanna, they wanna All that love, all that talk, give me love ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******
